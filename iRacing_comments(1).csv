"Health and success, wtf?"
Limiting unplanned downtime.
"Databases get slower and slower over time. 

Every so often you need to reorganize them to make them fast again.

It's like disk defragmenting back in the old days."
"Nice setup. ARCA at Concord were ""who could survive under 25 incidents to the end"" races."
Someone visited Microcenter 🧐
"Yea, oval is super fun."
Yeah oval racing hit me like golf 😂 Never was interested in watching but damn it is fun to actually play.
"I tried ovals for a bit with a super janky triple 24"" setup, and it was unreal. Loved being able to look through the netting at people side by side."
I see you beat me to this!! lol. Damn microcenters. Wish they were in Canada
I have greatly enjoyed this little shit box. The slip stream affect has made for some tense fun at the end of the final straight.
"The flip in pits is weird, but it seems like it's repeatable (unless we start assuming that the person who repeated it also has a ""hack""). The weird grip in pits is also strange, but I don't know if you can't cause it by some weird brake/gas combo. 

What is left is strange lines, but still good speed as well as lack of slowing down from hitting the curb or being on the grass. I don't know Pontiac that well, maybe it's something expected, maybe not...

Overall hard to say, but definitely worth sending to iRacing for investigation."
"I’m relatively new to iRacing, but isn’t this is a legacy car that hasn’t seen the light of day again until recently? I wonder if it has older physics that were never updated."
"Skip to the pit road footage around 12 minutes for the real ~~smoking gun~~ likely bug.

EDIT: look like it's a load of nothing and likely a combination of draft and legacy car bugs."
"I’ve seen a gr86 grip roll like that once out the pit exit at spa, weird wither way. I wonder his steering inputs on the carousel look worth looking at too at 9:50. Could just be a weird replay? It doesn’t look normal though.

Edit: carousel not chicane mb"
"The trouble with assessing the performance of the other cars based on your own replay is that you get a low-fidelity simulation of the other cars. The ONLY way to know what the other cars are doing, accurately, is to have direct access to their replays. The data that your client is sent from the other clients is much lower res. That usually shows the cars ""on rails"" or the opposite, excessively sliding. Same with the speed, it's close but not perfect."
"Another shit tier Dave Cam clickbait...

Grip rolling is just legacy car things. Even GR86 on release grip rolled super easily even without extra effort."
"Fishy, sure, but none of this feels impossible without hacks. If it was a 9k driver behind him would he be suspicious that he can merely keep up on cold tires with draft? Any examination of how the car moves in the corners or how it accelerates or the weirdness in pits can be explained by iracing lagginess."
"With multiple people proving flipping the car in the pit lane is absolutely possible without hacks, can we please delete this fearmongering post? Thanks a lot"
Dave cam is a fucking idiot. That grip roll happens on the 86 as well. Anyone that listens to anything this guy says should have their head examined. Imagine making an allegation and witch hunt over a stupid physics glitch
"""Sim racer experiences Pontiac slipstream for the first time""

Seriously 0 hard proof. A teammate of mine was complaining that 700 ir guys were keeping up with him as well. So I think it's just the car's slipstream that is broken.

Have to agree, the circumstances are fishy but there is no hard proof at all.

\[edit\] I flipped the car.. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgLAweFWqQc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgLAweFWqQc)"
The chasing car never appears to slide even at those speeds. Add in the weird steering in the carousel plus the pit shenanigans and this looks pretty strange.
What i find very interesting is that it seems iracing took down 2 threads on the forums of people talking about this
I lost braincells watching this.
"To me, the strangest part is how planted the car looks everywhere. Body roll and curb strikes are so much less. Maybe just a banging setup?"
I think the guy is 100% cheating. Just seeing the difference in the car behavior is the dead giveaway to me and also him accelerating way faster than he should be able to in the draft. there’s no way he’s not and also I’m pretty sure you can go on Dave’s profile and find that exact session so there’s really no point in keeping the dudes profile obscured
"I have absolutely hated this shit box this past week haha. I didn't finish a single ring all week. I have been punted every single time at kreuz without fail every single 1st lap.

Its never the guy directly behind me, its the dude 4 car lengths back that goes into the grass and missiles into 2-3 people. I kept entering thinking ""this wont happen again"". Boy, was I fucking wrong -  I went from 2.6k to 2.1k JUST from ring."
It really needs an official series again. It was a blast during the 15 anniversary week too 
Yeah it sort of annoyed me that he started experimenting the flip without repeating any of what the actual guy was doing in the same conditions
i had a quick try of on the grass up that hill at least. i was slightly slower dropping just barely to 99mph but kinda doubt my line coming into there was optimal or really good
"Yeah it's just the lateral grip bug that iRacing has on some cars.  Solstice being unused isn't surprising that it would go unreported. 

But content creators will create click bait for views regardless of facts. "
"last update i could find to the tire parameters in the release notes was 2021 season 4.

there were also some cars rolling when they changed the gravel and grass i think. i think the street stock could be rolled in some situations"
I managed to flip it in my 3rd attempt [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgLAweFWqQc&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgLAweFWqQc&feature=youtu.be)
"Not a smoking gun. 

iRacing bug where some tyres have too much lateral grip. Usually fixed quickly once reported but not many people are out there slinging the Solsticr around. "
"Yikes. Yeah, those look like grip hacks to me. 

It would be a lot more obvious if it were a faster car, but that pit lane thing is sketchy lol."
Thats how the inputs almost always look for me when im watching someone elses onboard.
"I thought the same thing. I've personally never seen another driver's wheel look like that when I watch replays of my own. Interesting that Dave didn't mention it, though. Maybe it's a common thing for him to see because of lag or something."
Did you watch around 12:40? The suspected hacker was able to seemingly change the grip applied to his car at will. Grip roll the car from a stand still and then turn off grip completely.
"yeah my thoughts exactly, other people have shown the car can be flipped and i know in the past driving the skip barber the draft and can be very powerful and almost seem unrealistic even if your not directly behind. For me not enough evidence of cheating and would put it down to a very fast driver, replay not being accurate and broken/unrealistic  draft."
A 9k driver wouldn't be taking those lines tho. That's the odd thing.
What about the weird burnouts? Clearly turned the grip down.
Why delete it? The discussion is healthy and keeps the “scandal” from taking on a life of its own.
"Technically just one person multiple times but yeah, this is a bit tinfoily for my taste"
"I get your point but how is it a witch hunt without names being named? (At least so far, not at home to check updates)"
"Did a couple of these this weekend and yeah, the draft is a lot stronger than DC makes it look. That said the pitlane shenanigans were a bit odd. Never seen a Solstice grip-roll but it's been some time since I drove it!"
"Backing you up on this.

&#x200B;

I have two videos of other people grip rolling, one isn't even in the pits and can do it.  Another video of someone doing a grass dipping run, it's only 3kph slower than no grass dipping.  Their names appear in the video and not asked for permission to share.

&#x200B;

The car is broken.

&#x200B;

Also, in a couple of places nothing is wrong, Dave got schooled by a smurf.  Dave's Karussel was awful, so awful."
That's what I was thinking until about the 12 minute mark of the video.
"Did you just watch 5 minutes of the video and turn it off or what? We know there’s not hard proof, that would require a pc check of this random iracer. The point of the video is to bring to light some extremely suspicious behavior"
"Nice flip.

So in your opinion, do you think the draft is just so strong it can make up for bad lines, going on the grass, and cold tyres?

I just find it odd that if someone is that good at keeping the car planted, that they would drive those lines..."
"They don't allow forum threads about cheating, never have done. Its not unique to this."
Just one step closer to becoming a regular davecam viewer 
"likely just the replay not showing what's really happening to the car. when watching a replay in game its not an accurate reflection on what's happening, an easy example of this is seeing cars brake a lot later than they actually do in reality."
i'd assume this is ringmeister given that's the only thing running the solstice and is fixed. if it isn't cheating i'd more put it down to connection
"> I’m pretty sure you can go on Dave’s profile and find that exact session so there’s really no point in keeping the dudes profile obscured

That's more work than 99% of redditors will do. 😂"
"ring giveth, ring taketh away"
"It's a tough lesson to learn, but I've concluded as a general rule, if I fuxk up 3 consecutive races or get completely murdered 3 races in a row, I'll either just stop for the day or race something else. You can always come back, and I've found it gets better for me after having actually finished a race somewhere else. If I'm fed up with ringmeister shenanigans I'll do a race of arca, you know, to balance things"
"Yeah, some try hard trying to rocket through at the start on cold tires always seems to cause the big one before you get to Flugplatz."
"Iracing just stopped adding tires to release notes because of people crying for non existan changes, so they just update them silently now"
"Found the cheater!


/s"
"Ha, whaddaya know. ~~Did you do anything in particular to get it flipped? Just floored it with auto clutch?~~ YES I KNOW THE INPUTS ARE THERE I AM NOT VERY SMART"
Or he's a content creator creating clickbait to drive views rather than providing an actual genuine assessment of a situation. 
"Below 10mph the cars don't even run the same tire model. They have an entirely different model for slow-speed behavior (it's a hack to get around the math going crazy at low speeds) so any behavior you see on pit lane or at slow speeds like that is 100% irrelevant. If the driver took the car out the pits, up to speed and then flipped it at the first corner, that is clear evidence of excessive grip but that's not what's happening here."
Not sure about the burnouts but i have seen the flip now multiple times
"Which lines specifically? Other than him weaving weirdly on flat out sections, which I do too when I’m distracted by something."
"There is no discussion to be had, this is just fearmongering"
Drives views to a sensationalist clickbait video that doesn't deserve the revenue. 
You can go to his race session and see who it is
"Yeah his carousel was very suboptimal, you can carry a ton of speed out of the exit. I think dave just hadn’t figured the car track combo out and was surprised someone could keep up with a hotlap like that."
"If that is your ""hard proof"". I managed to flip the car, [https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1ae1cre/comment/kk572fv](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1ae1cre/comment/kk572fv) 

So I hope you all stand a little corrected now"
i mean at least the grass in the uphill section barely slows you down. i went to 99mph being slightly slower into it and without draft. and i'm not even sure their lines are that terrible
huh didn't know that
That’s weird and unhelpful imho.
Not sure why you’re being downvoted lmao
"Yeah, which I should have done but I absolutely love ring and usually never have an issue. For some reason this combo has absolutely tested my sanity. 

I took the weekend off because I was so fed up by Friday. At first I was breaking even with IMSA and GT but Friday I had multiple required(s) exceeding 20 minutes that I lost 90+IR multiple times and couldn't offset it with the time slots I did IMSA at - where a podium was only getting me 20ish IR."
i mean clutch doesn't see any input so
The inputs are there mate..
I won't tolerate this Dave Cam slander (not even joking).  You obviously don't know Dave Cam.
"Eh, maybe I'm a rube, but I give Dave more credit than that. He puts out plenty of content without needing to make stuff out of whole cloth."
"The lines Dave talks about through the various corners. Dude catches Dave while taking narrow entries and missing apex's. On cold tyres too. Just nothing about this guys driving screams ""high rated driver"" to me."
And clickbait!  Gotta drive views
"Dave had a decent time, only 3s off the top qualy lap but a lot of the time is severely restricted by the slow pace of the car.

&#x200B;

And it's not only the exit, Dave was dipping a small car into the gully which you should never do, concrete only!  Guess what the other guy did? No gully!"
"I didn't say hard proof, you did. If you need me to elaborate my position, it's that most of the video can be dismissed, as it's not even fishy. I mentioned the 12 minute mark because that is where things begin to look a bit odd. Odd does not mean ""absolutely sure of cheating,"" in case you need clarification on that."
"Not terrible, but on cold tyres, and catching Dave. Makes Dave look like a rookie. I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion tho."
It's pretty standard. Game devs don't want open discussion around cheats on their forums because of the potential for more people to go out and seek those cheats.
"IMSA at nords has been eaither fantastic or enraging for me, especially in the GTPs. I've basically either won or shunted. That's just kind of the nature of nords sometimes, smooth sailing or absolute hell.
Glad we're at sebring now, should be easier not to die eveey other race lol"
"No. I've seen enough of his content to know he's the worst for it in sim racing. 

The number of times he's made grandstanding videos quitting iRacing yet here he is still. 

He's a fucking douche too. Going into community discords attacking them for trying to promote the community in the comments in videos that he's posted. "
Nah he's a douche.  
"His lines are fine, he was consistently carrying more speed through the midcorner than Dave and using way more space on exit in a few corners. He misses some apexes a little, maybe because of the cold tires, but he was getting along just fine."
[deleted]
"Fair play, I actually thought the comment said this subreddit. My fault for not reading properly. I’ve noticed lots of discussions about cheats get deleted from this sub which is strange as it’s not one of the rules. Like the launch control pedals. 

I personally would like to know if there’s cheating/controversy going on so maybe I’d be better equipped to spot it and report it if I ever see it.

Good hard fair competition is what iracing is all about for me I like knowing me and the aliens are only separated by skill and effort."
When has he said that? I’ve not been watching him for long I might have missed it. Do you have a link or video title?
"Sad take, man.  He's one of the most mature, balanced sim racing Youtubers."
Whatever you say mate.
"The concrete? Yes.  The tarmac filled gully at the bottom? No, if your car can fit purely on concrete banking, which these do."
of course he doesn't. Don't believe everything you read on reddit please. Make up your own opinion.
I'd rather not give him views or engagement trying to find it. 
"A mature balanced sim racer doesn't go into a community discord and attack the community manager. 

I'm not calling him a douche for no reason. He's earned that title through his actions. "
"You really hate him that much huh? 1 click isn’t really gonna make or break his career, enjoy your boycott though matey. 

I’ve got time for Dave Cam tbh, he seems like a reasonable guy. Don’t always agree with him but I don’t always agree with anyone."
"I just have no time for shitty content creator influencers. They have no actual opinions or understanding of anything, they just say whatever will drive them views.  Bonus is when they can create fake outrage because that drives extra engagement 

This video is a perfect example. 5 minutes of asking people or thinking would show that it's explainable phenomena. But that wouldn't allow him to create a 15 minute video filled with fake outrage, intentional misunderstandings and a few ad pauses. "
"That’s the format of everything on YouTube nowadays though. No one’s forcing you to watch.

Just really confused as to why you feel so strongly about a softly spoken guy who enjoys making videos about his dorky hobby for us fellow dorks to watch and enjoy. He thought some dodgy cheating might be going on, and said he might be wrong loads of times."
"According to Steve Myers with iRacing, it’s still coming. 

https://x.com/iracingmyers/status/1745681900981596499?s=46&t=DJtKd85R_TAnDJXFq3mD0A"
It’d be awesome if they were to release it to i guess preserve the series like they have done with historic tracks
"I was wondering the same thing. We haven't heard anything at the start of this season so I was hopeful next season we might get the series/car but now I wonder if we ever do.

Unfortunate.. guess I have to just get into LM"
Well still getting the car for a defunct series. Just another dead series om iRacing
I wouldn't put a whole lot of hope into iracing spending time and money to continue developing for a now defunct car/series tbh.
#cursed
I’m glad they’re still gonna add it because for me as a painter I can have the opportunity to make plenty of 70s NASCARs because of the wing
Been wondering that myself
"I can’t help but think they’ll treat it like a lower class series like the CARS tour late models, would be interesting to see"
"That's great news! 

While SRX has only raced on ovals (pavement and dirt), I recall they had plans to include some road courses in future seasons. Wonder if iRacing would include all three track types in the official series."
Thank god
https://twitter.com/iracingmyers/status/1745681900981596499?t=DJtKd85R_TAnDJXFq3mD0A
"Yeah that would be weird if they kept something around for an entire decade and kept updating it even after the series had been defunct for many years.

Speaking of Skip Barber how is that series doing these days on iRacing?"
They've said the car is coming. What they lost was the series promoting iRacing in return.
https://twitter.com/iracingmyers/status/1745681900981596499?t=DJtKd85R_TAnDJXFq3mD0A
Also just paint it red and throw a Ferrari logo on the nose too. Redneck F40
"It’ll be interesting to see where they put it in the classes, we have Street stocks, SK mods, SLM, and LMS already pretty fleshing out lower license oval racing 


Could SRX become something like Dallara Dash or Carb cup? Maybe another series will get phased out"
"It would be so cool if SRX went to some smaller road courses, like Nelson Ledges, Summit Point, Carolina Motorsports Park, etc."
I am for sure getting it on the T.A.I.L schedule for the Nordschleife
Skippy existed at the time when it came out. SRX would be obsolete if it were to be released today.
"Oh hell yeah I didn’t even think of that, all I know is I wanna get my hands on making the 71 and 43 cars first from 1970"
"I think it will hybridize paved and dirt short track racing as it’s way to be different. Honestly I’m excited for it, the cars look like a blast to drive, and wouldn’t be surprised if SRX still does some events this year on iracing"
"Small club tracks that are fun with the Street Stock would be perfect for this, tracks like Summit or Lime Rock"
"Yeah!

I could potentially see it replacing the SK modified series to be honest"
They are square too so road is also an option.
Damn I really liked last weeks shit box
"*I will not stand Solstice slander.* 

This game was BUILT off of cars like that. Show some respect for your elders and NEVER speak that way again. 

But yeah, it’s kind of a shit box."
I mean if your playing sim racing games and you have to fight the urge to rock back and forth so the shit box stop slowing on the hills then you’ve done a good job simulating the solstice. I hope it returns again.
what I hate the most is the livery placement.
If you need SR just run with a red bull livery and people will stay away from you out of fear
"Hello everyone, I am the driver of the redbull car. For a bit of context: I was reeling I. This pack of 4 for the whole race and I finally caught up to them whith about 1.5 laps to go. I got an insane draft going into turn 3 and out of turn 4. I got a much greater run than the car infront of me and I realized that there was no where for me to go on the inside and I did not realize that the other car was so close. 

Initially I thought that we had both moved and it was mutual, but that is not what happend. I know it looks really bad when looking at it on a replay, but this was by no means intentional, and I am sorry about it. Atleast we both crossed the line in 4th and 5th so it didn't completely ruin the race."
This is a universal truth that applies to any racing title with custom liveries (and any energy drink for that matter).
"Lol this is my buddy. 

He is very sorry. We've been texting about it on and off all day."
Isn't it the McLaren pushing the Red Bull?
Why did the Red Bull jerk to the right like that so suddenly? Were they hit from behind or was this an intentional wreck? The view is hard to tell. It doesn’t look like they got loose so I can only assume they were hit or this was intentional.
"Wish we had another angle here -- this really looks like all four drivers running out of talent at the same time, not something that's on the RB driver."
He tried so many times to pull that off the wall. He would have murdered the whole field
Bonus points for a Senna helmet
"That one didn’t look too intentional. Looks like they lost some grip or maybe panicked. Arguably P4 was the cause by taking a lazy drifting line and not holding it and leaving space like they should’ve. They contacted the RB, and from there it all just went to shit. 

For a real Red Bull livery crash you need someone to come from 10 car lengths back up the inside at 40mph higher than an appropriate speed for the corner (this part is crucial, they must be going so fast that they wouldn’t have made the corner anyway), T-boning you all the way into space and as you chest heaves through the agony of every broken bone in your body and you come to the realization that you’re about to take your final breaths, you hear a faintly dimming string of expletives, threats of protesting and claims that you should’ve gotten out of his way because he was so much faster."
"I was playing Forza with a friend in the open lobbies and noticed someone had joined with the red bull livery. Sure enough, they crashed a few people haha."
"Usf was a blast this week, I love them on ovals"
Why is it that the biggest weapons always seem to run F1 liveries
Red Bull and mercedz in super formula are the worst there is no possible way that someone with this liverys is trying to finish the race. I swear you never see an Williams driving that bad
Don't be racist to red bull livery guys. They try their best 🥹
"“You clearly need to practice your crash evasion skills.”

*It’s satire about some bullshit I see in this sub*"
Can anyone tell me what series this is?
Penalty for Ocon
"I was playing Forza with a friend in the open lobbies and noticed someone had joined with the red bull livery. Sure enough, they crashed a few people haha."
"jokes on you, I race with a red bull livery"
Looks to me like Orange #3 hit the right rear
"Didn't notice it at first, nearly gagged when I did"
"In a bad day I fight them even more due to irrational hate.

Yes, I always end up with half a car on another circuit."
"Doesn't work. If you run the Red Bull livery you will wreck yourself, and others."
"Hey all good man! Seems like you had a bit of a calmer race than those of us involved in the battle for the lead, which had lasted basically the whole race. You arrived on the scene of a couple drivers who were very determined to battle it out until the last foot of race track, and had gotten used to running really close together. It's a learning experience, and yeah, since this was coming to the checkered flag, we all still crossed the line in a top 5 position. I never thought it was intentional; it just wasn't an optimal reaction to catching the car in front so quickly. You'll gain better situational awareness that'll prevent incidents like this as you keep racing!"
This pretty much nails what everyone is joking about tbh
"Just a heads up, your livery is crooked / off center and it looks a little goofy"
"In my experience it's any F1 team livery, Red Bulls are just easier to spot at a glance."
Yeah someone dinged that redbull. 
"Pretty sure the car in fourth there ran into the RB.

This isn't a case of getting wrecked by a Red Bull, it's a case of 4 drivers in the D-class open wheel oval race all running out of talent at the same time."
"I'm still not entirely sure? They definitely were not hit from behind though. I'll attach a screenshot later when I get a moment. I want to believe it wasn't intentional either, as that driver was not really racing this lead pack of cars until the last two laps or so, so there wouldn't really be any ""history"" so to speak with any of us that they were retaliating against. Really strange decision by them to make that hard right though."
"If you watch how he moves in relation to the wall, he doesn't move as much as it first seems. Seems it was just a small move to the right at the same time as the other car was squeezing the inside car.


Really tough to tell from an onboard though.


edit: upon seeing the screenshot, it would seem I've been fooled by the inside wall not being straight."
All three other drivers kept their line; the driver in the Red Bull made a move to the right that caused him to hit the #2 car (me). Notice the sudden jerk of the steering wheel to the right?
Who contacted the rb?
"USF2000, or I believe they have it listed at US Open Wheel D. It runs concurrently with the US Open Wheel C, Indy Pro 2000 as part of the IndyCar progression."
 What Has Been Seen cannot Be Unseen
"Yeah this was one of my first races back on after a 7 month hiatus. Definitely a big lapse in judgment. Thanks for the kind words man, I appreciate it. Happy racing!"
As an F1 fan it pains me to agree with you.
"https://preview.redd.it/88k62gatiffc1.png?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bced07a169637b1c71c67b4e49a2b67228e828d

There was actually no prior contact that caused the RB car to swerve right - here's a screenshot from the moment before contact."
"It looks like the Orange car may have hit his right-rear, but again, it's hard to tell what happened from this POV."
"I guess I have to take your word for it, but again, the front two diving all the way down to the inside wall is pretty aggressively stupid behavior, and getting mad at the third car in line for not handling that well is a whole choice."
"You know what, you’re right. It looked like the white and blue car came down but it didn’t, that was the RB coming up."
MY EYES
Is the primary reason I learned to paint my own skins haha
God damn netcode eh?
"https://preview.redd.it/89dpg5tqdffc1.png?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a40ec5c303311ac4e908203db5d573ecd4ddab0c

Here's a screenshot from the moment right before the contact. I can definitely see why it'd look like the RB driver was maybe hit first based on the video; I probably could have provided an additional angle in the video originally."
I back this up.  I would like to see other angles to make a decision on this one.  Looks like the outside car is pinching the other cars low.  Maybe the Red Bull is reacting to the slight bobble from the lead car.
"Some more context I probably should have provided: This was the last corner on the last lap of the race and this was for the win. I'd been racing the other two drivers pretty hard all race long and as a result I think we'd established a high level of trust in our collective ability to race each other aggressively yet fair. The driver in the black/white car directly in front had consistently been holding an extremely low line off of each corner for the previous five laps or so, in order to proactively defend his position in line. There was no way I was going to be able to get below him, so I did what I felt was the next best option for a last-ditch effort to win: Pinch his line off on corner exit and hope that he lifts (didn't work, dude knew what he was doing.) I'd agree about it being too aggressive if this happened any time prior to the final two laps, but we'd definitely established a good level of trust in each other over the course of the race. The variable we weren't expecting was the RB car arriving on the scene at the last moment and turning right coming off the corner. Ultimately I still finished P3, so I'm not mad about it; I just found it funny that once again a Red Bull livery car was an agent of chaos, like I've seen many times before in formula cars!"
"I made a red bull livery in Haas/rich energy colours with Monster energy font. 

Never had such clean racers around me"
"Oh dang. Yeah, you're right."
"Redbull driver here. This is exactly what happened. Leader came down, and scared me up. It was not a malicious move at all."
"The annoying thing with tradingpaints is that even if you ask it to remove all downloaded paints when you leave a session, it only does it once in a blue moon."

just by bigger ssd ... problem solved
Aint no way youre gonna pretend 300gb is nothing for textures and its worth buying a hdd for them.
"Loading textures doesn’t benefit from an SSD? Idk bout’ you, but liveries popping in annoys me so much"
I'm not gonna go out here making symbolic links for worthless data lol. iRacing stores all this stuff on the C drive which is hopefully an SSD for most people
You can save it on any drive.  I save mine on D. C is for OS only.
"You don't even have to have symbolic links, you can easily move your Documents folder to a diff folder within Windows itself.  At the very least, I recommend not having the iRacing folder in Documents on your C drive just because of size of replays."
"1 tenth lost before braking, his top speed seems way above you

THerefore, he brakes about 20 meters before you, but less abrutly, and his braking curve is better (for some cars, you should not slam the brakes like you did), you can see that his corner speed is far better until you press the throttle again, you were probably too careful on the entry to save the exit

Check if the brake balance was the same, track and air temperature, tyres wear, tyres temperature etc."
"The actual difference isn't the single height difference between the curves, it's the area between them. Since the blue line has a higher speed for a long time, the difference accumulates to a large interval coming out of the corner.


In particular the entrance speed is much higher and the other driver keeps the speed higher throughout the whole corner. "
corner speeds. especially in slower corners can make a big difference. a 1 or 2kmh difference in slow corners like that are way more impactful than in high speed corners.  then you also have the run you get to consider. and line of course also plays a part.
Cause it's not close
"Literally shows you where the time was lost.

What software shows the telemetry it looks great
"Going to do that corner again until I'm 2 tenths of, will see if I can carry more speed into it as suggested"
Thats why its hard to go pro bro.. the margin of difference between you can a pro can be 1-5mph in corners. Razor thin but makes a huge diff. Requires precision.
"Race engineer here IRL....

I have to kill both of you for your brake lines 😂😂😂

Watch your exit speeds, the one who brakes late has the big balls....the one who accelerates early has the laptime"
"He had quite a bit more speed for more than 1000m. Clearly got a way better exit on the turn prior which is a lot of the .5. Is this a chicane of some sort? Seems yall are very close in that part, all seems to be the run up to the corner and entry"
"One additional point in your braking procedure is, that you have quite an amount of overlap in your brake/throttle. During the braking you are standing a little bit to long on the throttle. Because if that you need more braking to stop, the car unsettles and the braking becomes slower.

I would recommend, that you actively try to lift close to the braking point and then start to brake. This should solve the issue while not costing any real pace (if done properly). The goal is to get the throttle lifts a minimum as possible but while maintaining no overlap from bake and throttle."
"You cut off the steering angle which shows their slight turn in to get the car to rotate better under braking. Telemetry isn’t just gas and brakes, it’s how the car moves. How the car communicates.

There’s a lot of information through the steering wheel, both what the driver is telling the car to do and what the car is doing. That’s why people pay for the expensive bases"
Where is this telemetry from? I'm still pretty new to road racing and need to learn why I'm so slow most of the time.
"Same track temp, setup, fuel load?"
"It's not close.  Look at the axis on the first one for speed.  Essentially, it is way zoomed out, which it has to do because it's such a slow corner.  Therefore, any small differences are actually magnified."
How do you find telemetry readings for all this stuff? And how do you even find it in iRacing?
"Less brake, more send"
"This is where the second line graph in the image is strongest. Lots of people don't seem to bother with the time delta graph... but it literally shows where the time difference is.

it's hard to read because it's so small an image but looks like the following:

slight upward curve before the corner = lost  <1 tenth before arriving (so down the straight or off the previous corner)

major upward curve under braking...

subtle to start with, lost another 1 tenth by slowing down a touch faster than the example 

the steepest part of the curve, lost \~3tenths by being at minimum corner speed too early and and getting on power slowly because you were at minimum speed too early.

looks like another \~ 1 tenth on exit, I guess from having slightly less speed between the corners but hard to see at this scale.

that adds up to 6 tenths but I'm rounding so minus 6 hundreths here and there and you get .540"
"Well to start with you're way too slow into the corner so you aren't starting on an even footing. Notice how the reference lap is all the way on the right side of the track to start this section, because it literally can't be anywhere else after a full send through 130R."
"Amateur here and it's been a long time since I've run Suzuka so I don't have a great mental picture of the section, but it looks like he's carrying more speed in, but using more trail braking to get the car rotated. You're fully off the brakes sooner so the front end unloads and you can't carry as much speed. You're on throttle quicker which is good in isolation, but since there's another corner right after, there's not enough benefit there to make up for the slower entry/mid-corner speed.

What car?"
"I think you mixed up the curves of reference lap and of op.

Edit: I'm dumb, sorry"
"Where did you learn to read telemetry? And what software do you use?
What’s your process?"
"Thought I uploaded the image, it's there now. What you say makes sense I guess. Didn't think about going 2mph vs 4mph is twice as fast. But didn't think it would impact times so much. I guess the time spent in the corner is relative. Going to have to focus on these more than I though was necessary."
And that is what I'm slowly realising....
"In other words, most time is lost with your corner speed."
"Yeah, but normally my throttle and brake application are way off, this seems really close but with huge loss of time. So I was struggling to see what to correct unless the Tele is almost identical, which of course, is bloody hard to do."
i think it's from vrs.
"Good luck! Your exit is fine, all your time is lost on braking/ corner entry. As others have said you lost some time before even braking, so maybe look at your run out of the previous corner. 

The other thing I notice is you're slowing down ""too quickly"". It sounds counter intuitive, but it means your minimum speed is earlier in the corner than the vrs lap. 

It's hard to say without knowing the car, but from the trace, don't be afraid to continue braking a little later into the entry, you might find you get more rotation."
"If you can get a ghost car for whoever you're comparing to and turn it on in iRacing, it'll become very obvious where you're losing time."
"The blue line guy is a VRS coach, and he is rapid. So I assume he's squeezed pretty much 99% out of that corner!"
"The coach is one of the fastest guys in the world in sim, that brake shape 100% does work, even if it wouldn't in real life."
"Was aware of that brake throttle overlapping, but really struggling to get rid of it and destroys my flow. Probably better to break the bad habit now though."
Fair point. I generally ignore that. There's definitely a sharper turn from left to right that I can try and implement
"VRS. Garage61 offers similar software and is free, but VRS has coaches upload their data and replay laps so you can watch as well. VRS has subscription tiers so you can get rookie stuff for free, then pay for the higher tiers"
"It's fixed setup, track temp was more favourable for me, but I'm normally just looking for really bad sections where I'm losing over 4/10ths then work on them. If I get under that on all corners I've probably achieved results as close as I can at current level. Which is just under 3% off pace. 

Not sure how I'm going to level up to the next stage. Trail braking, positioning was a big step up, the next part looks much more difficult to find the seconds and tenths."
"External apps. (Garage61, VRS) They get telemetry from iracing after the race then upload to their service. I'd suck without it"
You summed up the entire thread nicely.
reference would be blue given they are quicker through the corner. and blue does brake earlier
"Not dumb, mistakes happen :)"
"Garage61 all the way! 


Just reading the graphs, zooming in and out - nothing in particular.


However, the ""the area is the important part"" is from calculus and integration - the difference in speed in an instant (well, there is no such thing as instant, but lets call it a pixel on the graph) isn't really interesting. When you consider how long that difference is active for though, you get a better look at how much it matters - and since the x axis is time - that means that the area between the graphs is what makes up the time difference. 


speed (y) * time (x) will give you the difference in distance traveled, so the area difference equals how much further one of the cars got in the same time. "
"kinda hard to tell on just this picture for me. speed coming into the section will have cost a bit. but speed at the first apex my guess it seems would probably be the big time killer. it looks like there's parts were you are probably around 10-15kmh slower into the first corner which is a lot. 

there's also the fact that steering is hard to tell since the bottom is cut off it looks fairly similar. brake you'd have some more understeer thought since you are earlier off the brake and on the throttle because you are too slow on entry.

your speed trace is also quite flat in the middle because you overslowed and then just stayed at that speed"
"The devil is in the details. Just because your brake and throttle look similar doesn't mean the results will be. In this case, you carried a lower speed in, which means your similar braking brought you down to a lower speed than the target lap, and hence lost time. 

I'd argue that the most important data point is time delta and speed delta. As you find out, you can have similar graphs on the other inputs and vastly different results."
"Look at the bottom of the speed graph. That’s where more rotation is. So your min speed is a bit earlier than blues, so you’re apexing a bit earlier, or you’re not getting the speed right for the apex. This will hurt the momentum of the car.

You’re also looking for that minimum point to be relatively sharp, because you don’t want to coast or hover at a minimum speed for too long (if at all in my opinion)"
"I struggled with this, I've had much closer graphs still produce more of a time gap than I could understand, what's missing if the car's rotation, the combination of all the inputs, even minor can give another car more rotation, and a better exit, an the time delta just grows from that point.  I believe you need VRS paid to see yaw rate which is basically the best metric for car rotation you get in telemetry."
"Not free, garage61 is."
It is
"Thanks, it's the McLaren gt4. I thought I had to be sharper on the brakes and trail off, like a right angle triangle even though this guy doesn't. But I will try and keep it less aggressive"
"The potato brake shape never works, the attack is too soft and the trail brake is not long enough"
"Not just the replay laps, also a full video tutorial for the lap, which I find the most useful."
">ck temp was more favourable for me, but I'm normally just looking for really bad sections where I'm losing over 4/10ths then work on them. If I get under that on all corners I've probably achieved results as close as I can at current level. Which is just under 3% off pace.

if the VRS is the open setup that would go a long way to explain why its 5 tenths. Use the same setup as the reference and try to get tracks temps similar."
You are right and I had a brain fart lmao.
"I downloaded garage 61 a few weeks back. I’ll have to dive a bit deeper into it. :) because right now, the things you’re describing sound foreign to me. I do appreciate your response :)"
but free or not wasn't the question. and garage61 doesn't look like that
"Ah okay. I can't say I've driven the car (although gt4 will probably be the next series I venture into). But If I had to guess I'd say you're fine to apply the brakes quickly, nothing wrong with the initial application, it's just that you're hitting the minimum speed too early before the corner, which isn't allowing you the chance to get that bit of rotation at the trailing off of the braking"
"You’re correct on the braking principle, it’s just different because you weren’t carrying as much speed going into the corner in this example."
You are losing more in the brake release than in the initial braking.
"Apparently this particular coach makes it work. Tends to be how I brake too so it fits, there are other corners where the trail last longer.so it's normally more tapered"
"No need to focus too much on that analysis just yet; create an analysis session, add a session from someone about a second faster than you (don't go for the fastest people - go for someone within reach) that has driven the same car in the same season (i.e. recently) with the same-ish track conditions.

Start by looking at the graph which shows distance between you and the other person throughout the lap. You'll probably find that there's a few spots in particular where that gap really opens up, so zoom in on that spot and see what they're doing different - are they braking earlier (usually)? later? are they picking a different line through the corner? 

Are they braking more, but then bleeding off the brakes to keep more speed through the corner?

You usually want to dig down into a single corner/sequence so that you can do something useful without having to consider the whole lap at the same time. Use active reset inside iRacing and start practicing that single sequence of corners leading up to where your problem is.

Also, if you see that the graph that shows the gap is slowly separating you and the other driver, that's usually because the other driver had a (far) better exit out of the corner before the gap started opening. That's a good indication for where you should focus more on when you're getting back on the throttle (which you can see from the telemetry!)."
"Yeah sorry that wasn't clear. Replied to the wrong comment.  Was meant to say garage61 is a good alternative and vrs is not cheap. Data is virtually the same, just presented differently."
true. garage is alright if you just want to look at like user inputs. thought you then have to find good comparison data
"Crazy thing about vrs is that you can't overlap track data which is really useful in garag61. Unless that's available in the next price tier in vrs? Dunno, but that's more than actual iracing sub."
You can get the grid n go datapacks. They integrate with garage 61
"Every time I see some decrying the state of racecraft you can point to almost any gt3 race on a weekend to see rich wannabe race boys crashing into each other. 

I think back to a race from a few years ago at mt panorama. Guy in 3 rd starts the race by jumping the start and running off track. Then at the end of the back straight absolutely plows into the back of P2 ending both races. All on lap 1.

Post race interview he took no accountability and blamed p2 for braking “early” on lap 1 with cold tyres."
"Same with the hotlapping argument in GT3 racing.
""Oh people don't race, it is mostly just driving in circles after the start""
Yeah have you seen actual GT3 racing and focused on a single car?
Sure there are always a couple cars battling, but 90% of the drivers are not in a fight for nearly all of the race, after the start.
It is just like in iRacing."
"A couple of years ago I was at the IMSA weekend at Road America. So many yellows and safety cars. And that was the pros. So. Yeah. If they can’t keep it on the track in real life, I guess we have to be patient when it happens in iRacing."
"I never understood the weird crying after an incident.. tt happens. No one wants it to happen.


Biggest takeaway i had from watching pcup races in person is...


Its really fucking loud."
I spy on the Forza Motorsport subreddit to remind myself how incredibly good we have it on iRacing all things considered.
"1x only work too well on those who have a gambling addiction. They opt to gamble on a 4x than the safe meaningless 1x. 

But yeah, in general real life racing standards are closer to iRacing than people would like to admit. "
I think off track should be 0x for the first lap. Don't think it would be hard to implement
"Yes. I was at Austin f1 this year, and one of the support races was Porsche Cup North America. The racing was crazy with several yellows. But the racing was better, and the cars were louder than f1."
"If you're interested in GT racing of any kind, you should be watching Supercar and the various Carrera Cup's anyway. Yeah there's carnage, but there's also stacks of incredible talent racing for their lives to get a seat in the big leagues. Some of the best racing in the world in pcup IRL."
">The biggest difference? In the real races, cars often ran very, very wide to prevent even more disaster, whereas people often seem dead set on staying on track in iRacing. Maybe iRacing’s 1x works TOO well.

It's not the incident points that are the problem, usually. It's the obnoxious slowdowns, which are absurd on lap 1 - avoiding a crash can easily get you a 3 second slowdown penalty which you then have to serve immediately on lap 1, otherwise it just seems to increase rapidly. So not only are you losing time going off track, you're getting a 3-4 second slowdown which in reality loses you about 8 seconds, so now you're down more than 10 seconds. 

I think most would rather just risk crashing to at least have a chance of having a decent race after that."
"And these are professional level drivers that aren't hindered by limited FOV.

The main issue is that if you slow down for people spinning/crashing you take a 50/50 on getting rammed from behind or losing 5+ spots especially on the start. There needs to be a slowdown for ignoring yellow flags or overtaking under yellow. I know this might be hard/impossible to do for Iracing but it will solve a lot off drama."
"I had a season pass to brands hatch last year, saw plenty of races, all of them were as messy or messier than iRacing ones.

The only real difference is that there's a whole lot less self-spins. Presumably because you can actually feel your car in real life, and underdriving to conserve the car is much more common (GTWorld i'm looking at you)."
"> The biggest difference? In the real races, cars often ran very, very wide to prevent even more disaster, whereas people often seem dead set on staying on track in iRacing. Maybe iRacing’s 1x works TOO well.

Because iRacing grass might as well be ice. Even dipping two tires off into the grass can result in losing control."
"Well there's one common denominator, and that's humans. Humans make mistakes. I agree people need to chill out, both on track and as reactions to incidents. I can't remember the last race I watched without a yellow flag, shit happens when there's two missiles following very similar paths with minimal room for errors on their path."
getting a 1x as a A class driver is really punishing. A few of those and you know you'll loose some SR
IMSA too. Maybe not the same lap 1 carnage but definitely some of the stupid moves.
"I watched a GT3 race at Okayama this weekend, and I wanted to tell my wife that it's the same as iracing. What a shitshow the first lap was."
Big fan of F3. IRacing needs to go to Macau and give us Guia circuit.
"When you see people claiming every overtake move is a ""dive bomb"" it becomes clear a lot of people never seem to actually watch any kind of IRL racing."
"The only reason many endurance races don’t end with the leaders lapping the entire field multiple times is because of cautions. Without cautions, IRL races would end with massive field spread just like they do in iRacing. Cautions actually make racing more interesting despite people saying they are boring."
"IMSA in general honestly, this last Daytona 24 had a good amount of full course yellows. 

&#x200B;

I still loved every second though."
">I never understood the weird crying after an incident.. tt happens. No one wants it to happen.

And even posting their incidents here... show the fun parts instead of the negative parts!"
I had the pleasure of watching a PCup race at CotA back in 2016 and wow they made the F1 cars sound boring afterwards.
"Man that game is really the essence of soulless corporation makes low effort racing game to cash in on a loyal fan base.

At least you can tell the peeps at iracing actually care."
"I'm torn between making off tracks a 0x or a 0.2x incident. There's many examples that going off track is a smarter move to avoid incidents. As well as can we really consider barely going off track an actual safety issue? But on the other hand we need to discourage people abusing track limits, but I feel it could also be achieved if there's a counter for 0x where once you rack up 5 0x incidents it becomes a 2x incident.

I'm aware it opens up to abuse with, well you get 4 free 0x before it penalises you, but it's not dissimilar to IRL systems that give you 3 warnings and then a black and white flag (bad sportsmanship flag) for abusing track limits and then a penalty on the next infringement. I do feel contact should be the bigger emphasis for SR.

They probably also need to introduce bollards to drive behind to cancel cut track penalties. But I'm not holding my breath for an overhaul of the SR system, but I feel the introduction of rain will probably require it."
The MX-5 cup support races at IMSA are bangers too.  Conor Zilisch the rookie of the year in that series in 2022 just was on the winning LMP2 team at Daytona.  He's getting a shot at NASCAR this year and he's 17 years old.
Super car has always been my favorite. Miss the falcon days.
"They’re not ‘professional level’ drivers. About 95% of them are paying for their seat and the other 5% are talented enough to get a free seat but aren’t being paid by their teams.

The teams are professional or semi professionals but most of them rely on the driver paying for their seat as part of their business model. 

Some teams will have seat funded by say an F1 team or manufacturer, or they will have one seat they give to a talented driver to get results so their brand is attractive to pay drivers but the rest of their seats come with a fee. 

A lot of the drivers in these classes race in Iracing and their IRs are not what you think. Theirs a couple of Porsche Cup drivers I know of with a sub 1000 IR."
The lowest common denominator in RL with these classes is spoilt rich kids doing spoilt rich kid things.
My favourite is when people say I didn’t think you would defend.
"Managed to watch a lot of it this year, the starting few laps were literally iracing Daytona lmao"
A lot of those yellows were caused by one car though.
"I watched at Sachsenring in Germany. The track is quite compact, and if youre in the middle hill, its.. a thing to experience :D"
"I was only talking bout racing quality and respect, but yes, you’re right too. And I say that as a Forza guy since day 1 in 2005. Had much fun in various, serious leagues in FM 6 and 7. But that new one is the first I didn’t even try. Seems to be a dumpster fire, and iRacing ruined it for me anyway."
"I think that's probably unfair to the Forza folks. Like, I think they care, for sure.

They're victims of the expectations around Forza games. With Forza, *every* mistake across like 800 cars is considered a huge mistake. It's just as big a deal in that community that Daytona's pit exit is wrong (big deal) as it is that like, a car from 2002 which nobody has ever raced in an official series has the wrong tachometer shape, or something. 

And then with as big as Forza's community is, you've got a lot of people who just don't like driving/racing cars who get really upset about design decisions, and the attitudes around that game are almost no-win. If iRacing had 10X the audience and 10X the cars going, there'd be a lot more people who were upset about various nitpick things, too."
A 1x to avoid a wreck should be fine for most people. There's really no need to reduce things. 
"A buddy of mine went from iRacing, where he had over 5k iRating, to real life racing (French GT4 championship and Lamborghini Super Trofeo Europe) and he told me that without a doubt the racing was at a higher level in a high SOF race than in real life. It's easy to believe too, once you stop idolizing real life drivers as exceptional pros and start seeing them as business owners or dentists (lol) who can afford to race. Which they are, apart from the top 1%."
"I had a race last week where the guy kept stuffing his car under me in corners, floating up into me, and then accused me of defending so hard... i wasn't even defending, i was just trying to not get wrecked by you?"
I was playing some palworld with a few of the guys I race in a league with and some others were watching the 24 in the same gc. It was funny hearing how many crashes happened in that first hour alone.
"That American flag car (don't know team names off the top) was not having ANY of it that day, constantly spinning out and going off track!"
"Ah yeah there's no respect, and tbf I've seen people get taken out and get a larger penalty than the culprit themselves, so when the system is so broken and punishes the people that are trying to be respectful, it just snowballs into shit..."
"Trust me I usually give the benefit of the doubt to devs and such but I've been following the game since launch and it really is far beyond nitpicky things, and more genuinely bad design decisions that blatantly do not respect the player or their time. That's also just scratching the surface of what's wrong with the game.

When you've got die hard fans, that have tried to stick with the game, making reddit posts about how they can't go on... it's really borked."
"Well yeah, GT4 and Super Trofeo are literally amateur series. It's a hobby for the wealthy sorta like sailing or owning a pro sports team. Sure there will be some incredibly fast drivers there but it's not a requirement."
Had a much higher IR driver that struggled to get around while I was lifting well before braking just because they didn’t know how to get around not on the racing line. People just don’t practice multiple ways into corners. Or mainly just don’t really practice anything other than hot lapping alone.
I don't understand why anybody still runs a Ligier in LMP2 but thems the breaks.
"Didn't you say down thread that you haven't actually played it? 

I wouldn't put any weight on what the people on the FM sub say about the game. That sub is a cesspit of people who again, don't actually like racing or racing games. 

Forza is a mediocre game, but it's a mediocre game. If all you're following is the sentiment of a small number of fans, you'd think it's an enormous failure. The reviews on Metacritic are pretty much right in line with other Forzas. It's fine. It has some issues, but the people who talk about the game publicly have no fun with it except to shit on it. Don't trust them."
"I could play it for a week before the pavement stopped loading, I've tried every fix, every forum post and the game just doesn't work for me so there's that. The only thing I can do is follow the news around it.

Although I did play I pirated copy so I don't really hold that against the game too much."
"> Although I did play I pirated copy so I don't really hold that against the game too much.

Gross. Sounds like you got what you deserved."
"I am living pay check to pay check and i cant splurge on a game that barely works then yeah, I'd rather try before I buy. Can't afford iracing anymore either so you can judge from your high horse but does that mean I should just sit out on experiences just because some multibillion dollar company might loose a grain of sand?

Tbh I don't even know why I'm still replying, just taking my mind of things so thanks either way hah..."
"As someone who makes a living writing software: yeah, man. If you can't afford to pay, it means that you miss out. That's how life works sometimes."
Easy to say for someone who can afford stuff. I get one life and I intend to make the most of the situation.
Your assumption is correct. Higher is better.
"The beginners guide has a good overview of SR, but yes, higher is better. It represents how many corners on average you go round for each incident point you pick up, over your last 10-15 races. 

[https://ir-core-sites.iracing.com/members/pdfs/Beginners\_Guide\_100909.pdf](https://ir-core-sites.iracing.com/members/pdfs/Beginners_Guide_100909.pdf)"
"So— this is all pretty well spelled out in the Sporting Code. I know you said you read it but you might try reading it a little slower?

Yes, higher is better. Safety Rating goes from 0.00-4.99, and is calculated based on the number of corners you complete in Qualifying, pre-race Practice, Race, Warmup, and Heat sessions; divided by the number of incidents you have. The fewer incidents you have, the higher it goes. As your license class improves, the number of incidents you can have before it goes down decreases. An A2.00 has far fewer incidents per corner than a D3.00 has, for example.

When you have achieved a 3.00 in Rookie you’ll be promoted to D class and your Safety Rating will be dropped by 1.0. Then when you reach 3.00 in D class, at the end of the season, you’ll be promoted to C class. If you reach 4.00 before the end of the season, you’ll be instantly promoted. 

Each time you pass a whole number, 0.40 is added or subtracted. For example, if your SR is 2.95 and you gain .05 Safety Rating in a race, it’ll be 3.40 afterwards (2.95+0.5=3.00, +0.4=3.40). If your SR is 2.04 and you lose 0.5, you’ll be at a 1.6. Each time you are promoted, it drops by roughly 1.00. 

Yes, going up is good. It means you’re safer driver who avoids incidents. Down is bad. 

Avoid crashes and keep it on track. Keep in mind safety rating is a no-fault system. It doesn’t determine who is ‘at fault’ because that isn’t the point. Safety Rating is an indicator of how often a driver is involved in some sort of an incident, and that’s all! For example, someone who rams into the back of another driver who stops suddenly will get 4x incident points even though it probably wasn’t their fault. Another driver who swerves off of the track to avoid them will only get 1x incident points. The driver who avoids the incident, even though it wasn’t their fault, will have a higher safety rating than drivers who don’t take steps to prevent or avoid them. And of course, drivers who CAUSE incidents will likely find themselves frequently struggling to maintain SR."
"Your SR is calculated by corners vs incidents (or something along the lines) and yes, going up is a good thing. If you view your licenses it will show you what safety rating you will need to earn the next license. What position you finish has no bearing on how much you earn, it’s all based on how clean you drive."
"To keep it simple. Safety rating is a calculation of incidents per corner. The higher safety rating and licensing (A4.99) is mean you run every race with virtually no incidents. While you may want to focus on improving it, running in the back of the pack is not going to teach you how to race side-by-side. iRating is a zero-sum calculation based off your success in each split. It doesn't unlock new series but will pare you with like drivers. If you can stay clean, you'll have fun."
"SR = race clean, don't cut track, don't go off of track lol
Don't ram drivers, no pit maneuvers...
Just race clean. If you come out in the back, watch the replay and pay attention to yourself and then watch the guy ahead of you and then watch the guy ahead of him =) 

IR = stay alive and try not to fall behind, try and perform some safe overtakes. 
Do your best to finish some places higher than when you started. 


Remember, just drive clean and learn the tracks, learn your brake pedal. 
Go offline and practice race in the same track you're about to do online and see how you end up next to the bots.

I'm fresh in iracing too, but I can say that the experience has been pretty damn good and actually fun AF.

Oh, and, if possible.. have an extra spinning rust or SSD for clips because there will be some races where you feel yourself untouchable and then BAM ! You got yourself a prick who just wants to mess things up lol"

"Chapter 3, License Class. Section 3.7 - SAFETY RATING. Covered thoroughly."
"Theres a wiki linked at the top of the sub. [https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/wiki/index/#wiki\_saftey\_rating\_.28sr.29](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/wiki/index/#wiki_saftey_rating_.28sr.29)

Essentially SR is a weighted rolling average of Corners Per incident. Each license level is expected to maintain a certain corners per incident calculation. If you drive better than the expected level, you go up. if you drive worse you go down.

If you want to get promoted up to other license levels to race new cars, you need to get above 3.0 for end of season promotion or 4.0 for instant ""fast track"" promotion"
Well except that it sometimes goes down which is a good thing if the letter goes down at the same time :)
"How in the world did I miss this?! Excellent catch! Many many thanks! I'm on my phone right now, but I'll give this a thorough read when I get back to my computer."
Shoot. You're right. That's on me. I didn't read far enough. Sorry. I apologize for causing you any trouble. Thank you for prompting me to read further.
"Edit: I deleted my previous response because it sounded... not great. I came off a bit hostile, which is exactly the opposite of what I was trying to convey. 
I admit to being tempted to run at the back of the pack, but that's just not what's in the heart of a true racer. I'm sure you know that as well. 
So, I decided to run the fastest, hardest race that i can without compromising safety and a clean race. It was out of an abundance of safety that I willingly surrendered 3rd place in my last race. The guy behind me was SO much faster than me at that time. I could have raced him for position, but I figured the odds of a crash would continue to climb exponentially and the white flag had already come out. The safest bet was to surrender the position when it was safe to do so and continue to do MY very best to complete a clean race."
"IRacing is very specific about ""off track"" events. I have gotten multiple incidents from just the right or left side of the car being off. Not the whole car, just one side. I'll accept the penalties and do better in the future."
"Another commentor shared this with me. I'll read it fully shortly, but Erik and Charles demand my attention right now.  😁"
Yeah. I know now. I messed up and didn't read far enough. Sorry.

"Just an fyi, something that confused me at first is that SR resets to 2.5 when you move up a class.

Edit: me wrong. That’s just what happened to me when I went from rookie to d."
"That’s exactly the right mindset. 

You can run at the back of the pack and “farm” safety rating but… that’s pretty silly. Just race, but race clean. And make choices that lead to safe outcomes. Do what you can to avoid the crash."
No worries!
"No it doesnt. You lose 1 whole point. It does not reset. If you end the season having met MPR and at C-3.7, you will be promoted to B-2.7."
"Not quite, it loses 1.0 when you go up a class. While a 3.5 C would become a 2.5 B, A 4.0 C would become a 3.0 B."
"Really? So, right now I have a Rookie license. It says 2.72. I think someone said the next license is Class D. So when I achieve that, it'll go back to 2.50 for a bit?"
"Honestly, I don't think it's in me to just ""farm"" SR. I just can't tolerate being passed without some type of decent fight for the position. Unless, of course, it'll compromise safety. 
I'm sure at some point in the future, I'll be willing to take greater risks and really fight hard for a position, but maybe not right now."
Ah I was confused because I went from rookie to D class after only a couple races and it went back to 2.5 so I thought that was the standard.
"It’ll drop by 1. So where it lands will depend on where it is when you’re promoted. 

Rookie to D is the one that’s different than all the rest. You’ll be instantly promoted when you hit 3. But for example, let’s say you start a race at 2.98. And in the race you get +0.12. That’s 3.10. But there’s also the +0.40 you get whenever you go up past a whole number. So 3.50. In that case; you would indeed be at 2.50! 

But if you only went up +0.2, then you’d be at 3.0. Add .4, 3.40, subtract 1, 2.40. It’s a little confusing, I know, but you’ll get the hang of it. 

Try not to obsess over it too much. Just focus on racing clean. It’ll wax and wane with time."
"that is incorrect. If you have a Rookie 3.0 SR or higher at the end of week 13 of the season you will promote to the next License class (Rookie > D > C > B > A) as long as you have met your Minimum Participation Requirements (4 races or time trials). You can auto promote BEFORE the end of each season if you reach a 4.0 SR or higher. When you promote to the next license class, you lose roughly 1.0 SR. (For example if you finish the season with Rookie 3.6 SR, you will start the next season with D 2.6 SR). Each license class unlocks more series for you to participate in.

You can also get demoted to the previous license class if you finish the season below a 2.0 SR (with the exception of demoting from D to Rookie since you cannot be demoted from D to rookie). If you go below a 1.0 SR at any point during the season, you will automatically get demoted to the previous license class. I also learned recently that you can get double demoted by ending a season with less than 1.0 SR. (This happened to my friend last season. He finished the season with less than 1.0 SR so he got auto demoted + a demotion for having less than 2.0 at the end of the season. He went from an A license to a C license.)"
"Rookie to D is unique, but 
 if you get promoted mid season, you gain an additional 0.40 SR on top of the SR you got from the race that promoted you. "
"This is correct. 

A class 3.0 = B class 4.0 = C class 5.0, = D class 6.0 = Rookie 7.0. (obviosuly anything over 4.99 doesn't technically exist but this is the ""conversion chart"" so to speak)

When you are within a class you get the extra .4 anytime you move up and down over a full number. 

Rookie to D is ""fast track"" promoted at 3.0. Everything other class is ""fast tracked"" at 4.0 (assuming MPR is met.)

Demotions are ""fast tracked"" at 1.0 

And at the end of every 12 week season, or at the end of the crazy week 13 that is promotions are anything over 3.0 (assuming MPR is met) and demotions are anything under 2.0."
"Good LORD! I didn't expect algebra to rear it's ugly head in iRacing! 😂

Awesome explanation. I understand what you're saying."
"So, the takeaway should be, run hard, run clean, have fun, and try your very best to not crash everyone! 
I'm not always successful at every point there."
"you guys aren’t accounting for the fact that if you cross 4.0 you get the .4 bonus so realistically you start around 3.4-3.5 of the next class that’s what happened for me when I went from D class to C class 

D class 4.0 to C class 3.5 was roughly where I was at"
"It's fine, just keep driving.   This is all stuff people pick up eventually.  We all learn in a slightly different order.  How cool that you're going to be able to enjoy being aware of gaining safety rating now.  BTW check out Dave Cam on YouTube, great framework for approaching races."
"I can use all the help that I can get! I'll check it out soon. Right now, Erik and Charles demand my attention. Shaw must be defeated! (I've seen this movie about a hundred times and I still love it!)"
"He goes off track to pass, oversteers into you, and then stops on track to block you? This is peak iracing behavior."
Guy at the end is why you slow for yellow flags
"the second car t-boning the mazda stopping in the middle of the track was so funny 😭

sucks that this happened to you tho man"
"Car right. No seriously, car right! Lmao"
The turning radius never feels worse than when you spin out and are trying to get back on track
"You remembered to protest that person after the race, correct?"
Car low.  Car low.
Probably because you had the stupid racing line on. Take that shit off.
Does anyone have trouble with Mazdas for feeling like theyre too slow?
Mirrors man. Watch your mirrors. that is the takeaway here. first thing i noticed as soon as i hit play was the crazy car in the mirror.
Like how u saw the guy coming from behind and waited for it to happen.
Sorry this happened but this is a hysterical clip.
"Lmao that last t-bone was just hilarious. I’ve seen some
shit in the Mazda series but this takes the cake lol."
The main reason that I prefer to play Iracing with the IA
Yep. I’ve been just trying hard to get my safety rating up and this shit keeps happening to me
I was pissed getting 8x incident points for that too
Wasn’t sure it was worth the effort so I didn’t.
New to racing so having it on helps me learn breaking points and such.
"Always funny how you can tell the sweaty try hards from how they whine about the racing line.  If it helps people to have it on, let them have it on."
"No, I race on a single monitor and the 1m painted fucking ruler on the ground helps for depth perception and landmarking.

Imagine having the option to have a literal ruler on the track and not using it. Brain dead."
Are you referring to downshifting in them since you cant just mash it like an indy or F1 car?
"To be fair to OP, even if you see the car behind coming in the mirror, it's impossible to predict that it's going to suddenly spear across the track right in front of you.

To me this looks like one of those incidents where you just have to shrug and say that it wasn't your lucky day."
I was more so focused on the car in front because just before this he was super slow into the turn and I had to slow slightly so I was focused on what he was doing. I then noticed him in my mirror but it was too late.
SR comes and goes. Keep focusing on avoiding others on the track and you and it will get better. You definitely did the right thing just coming to a stop when he blocked you on track.
"It's been a while since I've used this strategy, so no idea of it still works. I would either intentionally qualify really low or not even try, so that I could start at the back of the pack. Then I would race the race a little on the safe side, just putting the laps in. Then it eventually brings up your safety rating to get out of the wild races. 

There were two big takeaways that I got from racing like this. The first was that sometimes I would earn a safety rating higher than I deserved and then I would race above my head and be the cause of my own rating dropping. It would basically be repeating the cycle until I realized I was the problem. 

The second takeaway was learning how to avoid the problems. I realized I was going extremely safe by trying to 'artificially' raise my rating. Which taught me that even though I might be in the right, if I didn't take action to avoid the incident, my rating would go down. So sometimes I would sacrifice a position, or two, to keep my rating up. This was really the bigger change in how I raced. Even though it's not real, I would try to avoid the wrecks or incidents, even if I knew it wasn't my fault. Like if a competitive driver came up behind me, not necessarily faster, and he seemed like a bit of a loose cannon, I would let him pass. Sometimes he would wind up taking himself out, sometimes not. 

Eventually though, my rating increased and I would get into races with more predictable drivers that I could emulate their lines and decisions, which ultimately helped me become the best iRacing driver!  .... okay maybe not the best, but it helped me improve my own driving, which it was way more rewarding having a race where I got to battle with a guy most of the race but we never took each other out. Even if he beats me, I respect him and can have a lot more fun losing because he finished faster than losing because he took me out."
"Some real smooth brains out there, as much as it sucks just gotta keep your head down and keep grinding"
You think that's bad? I was in a rolling start and literally had a 10 car pile up... Before the race even started...
That is a slam dunk protest and the reason that the protest system was invented.
"Even if the first is just an accident, the 2nd part where he pulls in the middle of the road and waits is a slam dunk.  You can also report for things you see, even if they don't hit you/you hit them."
"Also I haven't seen if it's been said but the racing line I believe is not dynamic, I wouldn't trust it to find brakeing points going forward, as they aren't per car that I am aware of."
"When I was new, I figured it out myself. Real world doesn’t have a racing line."
I’m not stupid and a child so I don’t use it.
This is why I use it.  My eyes also do not discern peripheral objects very well on a screen so its hard to find landmarks for braking like I would in real life.
"I have a huge problem with oversteering when downshifting in the mx5, any advice, im only used to f1 type driving"
"Don't listen to him. You can't stomp on the brakes every time there's a crazy person in the mirrors. You held a steady line on the side of the track, there's nothing else you could have done."
"You don't get out of the ""wild races"" by farming safety rating, only irating. Anyone can gain SR easily, not everyone can gain irating easily"
"Are you sure you have actually played iRacing. From this novel you wrote, you have not"
For sure. I’m only a few races away from d class
"Was that in the PCC? I did 4 PCC races, and there was a crash before the race start in every single one."
but does it make it worth the effort? You dont get points back and iracing wont even confirm if they side with you. That's the problem
"> as they aren't per car that I am aware of.

They're definitely per car (as in the racing line is different for an MX-5 vs a Ferrari), but they're not dynamic. For example if you're going slower than expected, the racing line won't adjust the red zone etc."
lmao
"Also, the MX-5 requires a throttle blip on downshifts"
"your downshifts need to be spaced.  You're only using 5 gears so no need to mash.  Also try to finish your shifting before you turn so youre not braking, turning, and downshifting all at once."
"Novel? I didn't realize I needed to speak like someone has the attention span of an ADHD nat. Really though, It's been a few years since I've put in some laps, but that was my experience when I did it. I guess things have changed.

But like I always say, If you want to find the right way, post the wrong way on an internet forum and a neckbeard will tell you why you're wrong."
"The point of the protest isn't to gain something from it, it's to teach the driver who did the wrong thing that they did the wrong thing so that they don't do it again."
"> and iracing wont even confirm if they side with you. 

They do. 

If you receive the email that says ""This email is to inform you that the protest has been reviewed and the member under protest notified of the outcome."", it means they've sided with you."
Go ahead and laugh. You’ll never get out of rookie with that shit on
Thanks ill try it
Thing have not changed. What you wrote was wrong. You didn't race in higher lobbies because of your safety rating. It's one thing to write a page of correct material and another where it's completely wrong.
"Good to know. Why would they be so ambiguous? lol

However, you still lost points and iRacing does nothing to compensate. For $15, we should have a higher standard."
Didn’t realize racing lines restrict you to 2.99 I’ll turn them off
"Ok, then why am I wrong?

Remember to use short words and small sentences so people don't have to read a novel."
"Holy shit...after looking at your post history, literally almost all of your posts are you telling people that they're wrong. You must be an absolute delight to be around. Go touch some grass."
"In actual seriousness, the racing line is disabled in higher-level series. Unless you're here to only ever race Mazdas and Fixed Ferrari, you actually do genuinely have to do the work to learn the track at some point. It's better to put that work in now than when you have to unlearn all the bad habits the racing line taught you."
Good
U don't get in n2 ⬆️ level races with SR. 🎤
Lucky for you I have grass in front of my house. Just touched it. Complain all you want but it doesn't change the fact that you are in the wrong.
Yeah but by then you've been on the tracks enough to know them.  Racecraft is totally new to a lot of people on iracing so it helps.
I really only use to learn breaking points. I don’t fully follow the lines it shows. I will eventually turn them off but like I said I’m brand new to all this
"Oh, I see, you found the one small little nuance that I didn't clarify enough for you."
"You act like being wrong is this huge deal. If I'm wrong, and someone points it out, I'll take the information, move on and use it to be more correct in the future. Being an internet sloth where all you do is point out when people are wrong...you haven't changed your colors in a while. It's like you get some superiority complex about pointing out when others are wrong. In fact, I would be willing to bet you have at least one failed marriage where your ex complained about how you would always point out their faults. It doesn't take much to look at what you post and know that you live a miserable existence of low self esteem. I'm just fine admitting I was wrong, heck I haven't even looked back to see if I actually said the words that a better safety rating gets you in with better drivers. If I remember correctly faster lap times gets you into higher tiers, but then again, I'm fine with admitting I don't even really remember what the right thing is.

The point of my post wasn't how to get in higher racing categories, I don't even remember what they're called. The point was self reflection and how you can become a better driver by reducing your incidents. I can see that the point of self reflection and self improvement was lost on you though. You seem to like to focus on other people's faults."
Every group of new drivers goes through this cycle and none of them ever listen to the people who have already gone through the same cycle about how it's better to just rip the band-aid off.
"That ""little thing"" makes the entire post void. Countries have gone to war for less."
"its not always better, let people learn how they learn best.  Not everyone can have top tier rigs and 1k VR headsets from the get go and tens of hours to practice so they use what they can to learn.  Nothing wrong with having the racing line on to learn the braking zones of a new track."
"Yes! Kept that pesky Ferrari at bay after a late yellow flag with 40min to go.

It's a great day for 🇨🇦 and therefore, the world! 😆"
Congrats winning the 23H and 58M of Daytona!
"~~I’m stoked for my buddy in GTD Pro, he won!!!~~ He’s also won Trans Am TA2, won Asian Le Mans with BMW, and came 2nd at Le Mans 24H. Dude is a beast with different disciplines.

I was wrong, car classification numbers were off and I misread them."
I'm sad to see what happened to lexus. My buddy is the engineer for the GTD team. They had good pace early on
I'm just so happy for him! His overtake for the lead last night was beautiful. He raced so consistently and cleanly. What a beautiful thing to witness.
![gif](giphy|Ae7SI3LoPYj8Q)
Bowsette in VL!
For some reason it didn't feel right that the real life race didn't have 4 crashes in the first two corners of a 24h race!
I still find it funny how they put a Bowsette sticker on the car and gave an explanation as to why
That was truly awsome seeing him drive the wheels off that car. 24 hours and it barely had a scratch on it. Wonder if this will finally be his big break to be a full fledged factory driver. As he clearly has the skillset and pace to be racing in the pro class.
"Well deserved. Been watching his streams since it was sub 50 viewers. Great dude, great life!"
"Funkygarage the guy/store that makes that Bowsette sticker in the car was flipping out too, he had no clue about it and randomly started getting sent screencaps with his work in the car."
I was there cheering him on. Go watch the pilot race on Friday too. He was going 3vs1 against the BMWs. It was awesome. 
Yes! Just bought some of his gear and love his YouTube Videos!
ACC sub crying into their cocopops this morning.
Was awesome in the Friday race as well!
Shhhhhhh he always says you don't own him.  He wants to appear  unbiased.  Don't claim him! Everyone will know!
he has to win the triple crown before I buy the gloves
Congrats and you are amazing! Please keep doing what you do for the iRacing community provide more content for us to enjoy

Very cool!  I’ve been watching his sim content recently.
"Epic W. I was at the 24 for the first time over the weekend, fantastic"
what an intense race must be for him the last hour! Funny but I learned his name because of his iRacing content. Really happy for him and I was happy to see a familiar name as it was the first time I attended Daytona 24 in person.

He was driving very well in IMPC too
"I swore he had NOS equipped in that merc or something. He was just so much quicker than everybody around him, it was awesome to see."
"Stuff like that is why I like GT racing. Like AO Racing has gained a fan in me, by having cohesive liveries and car identities (Rexy and Spike). And thus the commentators talking about Rexy or Spike instead listing off what sounds like a craigslist ad for most of the grid..."
"nice, I was there too"
"That's awesome! Hope you had a good time. Could sure go for that Florida weather here in Ontario. 

I cant wait to hear what he was feeling coming off that last yellow flag. Just the thought of how intense the pressure is would easily make me cave in.

Same with the porsche and caddie for the overall win. Trying to handle one of those beastly GTP cars on top of that pressure is insanity to me."

It was so sad. 50 mins left
"thanks! It was a record breaking attendance this year for IMSA/Daytona 24. 

Very hot too since it is normally a colder weather this time. I still need to process everything I've seen but Cadillacs looked and sounded so mean that I rooted for them. When Cadillacs were passing grand stands near T1, you could literally feel the floor trembling. 

I was hoping till the last lap that Blomqvist would catch up with Nasr but the guy is so good and has some nerves of steel for sure.

the GTPs are indeed super advanced beasts, I was scared just to stay next to one lol

And Acuras indeed sounded like Chewbacca during braking

He is a good driver!
"Weather was all over the place... Cold at night, super dark clouds and cold and windy early morning then got warm to finish the day today.  I was there and swapped from t shirt to hoodie to hoodie and jacket and back to t shirt ten times lol.  Great race though."
Really thought he was going to have a chance at the end there too
That's Florida for ya!
Here too 🙋‍♂️
If it's for the current week then you can just look at the series results and see what people are doing.
"I use Garage 61 has a free leaderboard I use, sometimes for setups too"
"There are no official results yet,  you should register to Garage 61 and check your telemetry in order to improve,.You can look at https://www.iracingstats.net,  but no results are yet for next week"
"I use this.

https://www.simracingstats.com/RoadHistory.html"
"Since I usually practice a few days before, I've used VRS to get an idea of what the top/alien times are, and then I download a ghost from Garage 61 that is a couple of seconds slower, so that I can actually follow it.

For example, AMG and Suzuka, anyone has access to this, don't need to login: [https://virtualracingschool.appspot.com/#/DataPacks/271440002](https://virtualracingschool.appspot.com/#/DataPacks/271440002)

2:08.9, so I'd download like a 2:11 from Garage 61 to get after. I'm like 2050 iRating and that seems about right.

I used to pay $10 a month for VRS for ghosts, but seems to me Garage 61 is going to eat their lunch after they go paid, right now, it being free is the value of the year. Having the ability to download ghosts that are closer to you so you can continually improve is amazing. If you're running a 2:14, a 2:08 ghost isn't doing shit for you, where if you find a 2:12 ghost, you can actually keep up with it and get faster."
"Maybe I’m wrong but being out of pace, if you drive safely will not ruin other people race… will maybe not be fun for you but that’s all"
[https://iracingdata.com](https://iracingdata.com) might help you
"I don't have a link for it, but you can check the iracing wr database and do an approximation for what you should aim for. I go on it by googling iracing world records and one of the first few results is a reddit thread where the link is in the first comment Edit: for example the record for suzuka aston martin gt4 is 2:09~ and your 2:14 puts you round 200 ish on the leaderboard. Sadly, from here, it is up to you to judge if this is good or bad"
"Hey! As someone who likes to practice ahead of time, I always have the same problem. Garage61 has helped, but can be hard to filter out setups (if you’re looking to compare times for fixed). Sometimes YouTube can help, sometimes not. 

For this race (same car and track I’ve been researching), I have done a 2:11.6 as my PR but generally hover around 2:12:10. I’m about a 1700 irating currently. On YouTube I found one race from last year where 2.5k plus racers were doing low 2:11s, and some high 2:10s. So I’d say a 2:10 or lower is getting really advanced/alien with the fixed, and I’m expecting my splits to be mid 2:11s to 2:12s, but idk for sure. I guess we’ll find out in about 6 hours!

My guess is 1400 i ratings would fall around a 2:12 to 2:13 or so average."
💯
"Woah, this is sweeeet"
" >Having the ability to download ghosts that are closer to you so you can continually improve is amazing. If you're running a 2:14, a 2:08 ghost isn't doing shit for you, where if you find a 2:12 ghost, you can actually keep up with it and get faster.


This so much"
"According to the Clyde Coman guide on trading paints, that part gets stamped over by iracing and doesn't actually show anywhere."
I really wish there were some guides that go with these files showing where on the car each part is. Difficult to figure out for smooth brained individuals such as myself.
"Whenever I can’t find out what a part is, I paint it a really different color and upload. Example, keep what you have, paint that part bright red and see if it shows on the car. 

But while reading this comment section, I gotta check out that guide!"
It maybe something that’s only visible when the car is damaged.
I'm going to be getting iracing as soon as my dd+ ships. Is there a way I can get these templates outside the game to work on for like the mx5?
"Huge, thank you!"
Clyde Coman on trading paints makes labelled guides for almost all the paint templates.
"It's wildly necessary. I'm spending way too long making a small change, saving and refreshing my car, then squinting to find what difference there is.

I spent a while last night going through most of the parts and naming/color coding them in photoshop. Could be helpful if you're painting the F3:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fT0u1tbGwy9k0UHyCf\_FRQjTXEs5yAX5/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fT0u1tbGwy9k0UHyCf_FRQjTXEs5yAX5/view?usp=sharing)  


Edit: Looks like there's a much more talented person way ahead of me on this (Clyde Coman)"
"That’s what I was thinking. It’s too big a part to not show up, has to be under the engine cover "
"www.tradingpaints.com/cartemplates

You won’t be able to see what it looks like without having iRacing though. "
"Oh man, I gotta check him out, that would be so helpful!"
How do you find him on trading paints? Tried searching his name but got no results.
"“It's wildly necessary. I'm spending way too long making a small change, saving and refreshing my car, then squinting to find what difference there is.”

Same bro, same. Pain in my ass."
My thought is it’s under the connection arm of the weird big vent tube that sticks out from the engine cover
Thanks! Do I just pop it into Photoshop and work on it. What format does it need to be in a specific format or anything?
"Just google ""clyde coman trading paints"""
"The template is in .psd
You need to save a copy/export it as a targa file (.tga)

The file needs to be named car_[your iRacing ID#].tga"
Looks like unfortunately I can't get the templates or trading paints until I have a paid iracing account. Oh well I'll just wait a month or so.
You should be able to download the templates from that webpage without logging into trading paints. I just tried it from a private browser and it worked. 
Oh I mistyped the link and it kicked me to the main page. Awesome I found the diy instructions too. Thanks!
"One more question, is the mx5 everyone starts with the cup or the roadster?"

Thanks just saved me a bunch of wasted time!
"Darlington is like that for me. Lots of people hate it and it has a well earned reputation as a difficult track, but every time I run it, the lady in black is very nice to me. We just did a race there in a league I'm in and I ended up gaining 12 spots to finish 4th and with 0x"
"I'm new to Oval, and ran a few practice laps at concord, before deciding that I just didn't have what it took yet in the ARCA and not running it. Hopefully next week will be better."
I ran one race at it so I could get my weekly participation done at it
"I also found this track to be easy to get SR on. Like you said, take it easy learning the track. After a couple races getting passed by 1st place, just look at the lines they run and try to emulate it, slow and then start picking up pace at the obvious acceleration parts. You can really rack up a lot of SR if you avoid incidents (shouldn’t be tough in a reasonable SOF split)."
I don't even do short ovals anymore.
I've claimed from d to almost b in the arca this week lol. I like the car.
Sonoma is my track to kill at. NASCAR gt3 doesn’t matter. It just clicks for me
"Happened to me on Michigan, I'm less than mediocre on short tracks but those medium-long tracks I'm absolutely killer for some reason"
That dip between Apr and Jul makes an incredibly satisfying curve
"Same here, I felt constantly fast. That track just clicked for me. But I've never been so inconsistent in qualifying. There was a .5 second area that my times were in."
"Same here, I felt constantly fast. That track just clicked for me. But I've never been so inconsistent in qualifying. There was a .5 second area that my times were in."
"I moved from rookies to ARCA 3 weeks ago at Nashville, and was quite worried about Concord after face planting in Montreal, but did really well as well. 

In 4 races I got 3 top 5s, I even had the chance of winning my first race, had about one second gap to the next car, but then a lapper spun and did a fucking 3 point turn and I could not avoid it. Front wheel damage led me to lose about 2 tenth a lap, and I finished 3rd. 

Was a weird time to join ARCA, but I constantly climbed in IR and feel pretty confident in my consistency and crash avoidance (Never got more than a 4x, mostly 0x).

Looking forward to my first intermediate with Atlanta this week."
"I'm not the best. This is only 1800iR. But I can't think of another track/car combo that has me comfortably leading the pack and consistently. Lots of poles, and lots of top 5s. Lots of practice avoiding spins, and lots of practice correcting my own. 

tbh, i'm going to miss it."
Darlington is the best oval. Period.
"For oval, the key to practice is to start slow. Drive miss daisy around the track until you're comfortable picking up the pace a bit. Once you've got 50 laps down, it starts to click. Take the corners wide and slow, and get progressively tighter and faster.

If you're in practice, nobody really cares. You're all there for the same reason.

The first couple of races, I got turned around and lapped. Worked my way back up to lead lap and top 5 with little issue. I knew that if I could stop myself from getting turned by others I'd be a solid contender, and I was right.   
Not going for a pass on the front stretch (cuz folks tend to see me, then speed up and tap that wall, then come back out to center and take me out(not intentionally, mind you)), and going into turn 1 a bit slower than others usually let me pass with no problems in turn 3.

You can run 54 laps without incident, but that one incident on one lap will cost you the race. Solution... grind lap times, get  pole, stay pole."
Practicing with AI at Concord helps a lot. I also ghost raced a couple times last week with ARCA at Concord and it was rare there were incident or spin free laps. I decided not to run Concord officially because I wasn't experienced enough or fast.
"Everybody was wondering where you were. Every race, folks were like ""where's paydu?"""
"Had lots of 0x races, but they were offset by silliness. I think I walked away from this week with the same SR as I went into it with. Total wash. 

I have a working theory that car 17 gets tilted by hearing their car number repeatedly cuz lap times, and then they make dumb mistakes. Car 17 always, always, caused problems."
"I don't have a lot of tracks. Some weeks I'm stuck with pickup cup and street stocks, I jump at the opportunity to get into any higher class oval race. I think i'm at 5-6 bought tracks, and a couple cars, with a few tasty weeks lined up right away."
"Last season I went from D to B, I could be A right now if I bought some content, but i'm content where I'm at atm."
"That's the learning curve we all hear so much about. When anybody asks what a learning curve is, we have that picture to show."
"Unsafe rejoins, and guys shoveling their nose under your back end. It never stops."
That’s how I am at Atlanta in Indycar. I tried ARCA/Concord combo in AI and it was immediately nope
lmao the one race determined for me that I was not running it again when almost the entire field was lapped and a ton of wrecks block the start finish
"Practices throughout the week were total wreckfests. It got better as time went by, but still complete disasters in practice. Once the races started though, it was a lot better. I was a spinning mess in practice, just because I was trying really hard to get the 16.3 that some folks were able to pull out. Never got there.  

I think my best time this week was 16.43"
"That’s how I was when ARCA was at Kentucky for the first 2 days. Had to take a break for like 3 weeks because I got so frustrated (also hurt my elbow at the gym so I’m blaming that instead of my mental weakness), top guys running half a second faster than me and I felt I was on the absolute edge"
This league is great! Join us!
"As one in the midfield here, there's great racing to be had up and down the grid. Very positive and helpful small community in the league"
"Sebring is hard, with a fast car like the HPD even more 

The track is very wide at some points without any clear markers, try to watch the videos of hotlaps in slow motion, and take notes at each corner, study the video do not just watch and go"
look at lmp2 track guides not that far off.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHEk0NiA6AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHEk0NiA6AM)
"Thats one hell of a combo to start learning the HPD. It's a fun fucking track though, good luck."
Thanks Ill look for some of those too.
Thank you! This is the first one I've watched so far that has the input data anywhere to be seen!
"Ive done about 20 laps in the car so far. 5 at limerock and 15 at Sebring. All against ai. All disastrous lol. 

I don't plan to join any races until I can do some number of practice session laps without murdering myself. I think I'll aim for race day to be Thursday or Friday. 

It's really such a fun car to drive. This car and the spec racer Ford are so far my favorites to drive in VR. Not quite sure exactly what that is, but there is something about the open cockpit closed wheel race ars that are awesome inspiring in VR."
"[https://discord.gg/G9NNacjW](https://discord.gg/G9NNacjW)  < the community discord for the series where I got the video from etc. feel free to ask any questions in here super nice bunch.  


fwiw there is lot of time in that lap above, i Just did a 48.5 same track conditons/same setup. but its good starting point."
"Open cockpits really are the best in VR I agree. The HPD is a bit of a handful but very much so manageable, being fast in it is a whole other task at hand though. Sebring is just hilariously bumpy in prototypes and can be a bit of a workout and mentally exhausting to try to figure out how to best use the downforce. It's easily one of the best cars in the service though.

If you have any experience driving the LMP2 that knowledge transfers between the two very well. If not then all I can give you for advice is really learn how to trail brake so you can take as much advantage as possible before the downforce completely falls off. It's a fine line to ride but once you figure it out you can become an absolute weapon in the car - same is true for all of the prototypes."
i mean as long as it's done properly i wouldn't call it stupid. draft is a thing. yeah the draft from a gt4 won't be that much but a small amount would still be gained
"Aspiration, like breathing in vomit? https://www.healthline.com/health/aspiration

The low pressure area behind a car that lets you drive faster is called draft, slipstream, tow, or wake.

It’s a normal part of racing in multiclass, as you can gain multiple seconds over the course of a race by using the draft from the other class."
Draft/Slipstream
"Aspiration?    
Is that the correct word?"
"Because if you're behind someone, you get slipstream. Don't worry, they won't hit you, unless you do anything out of the ordinary. Would like to know how you got punted 'because of this'.

It sounds crazy, but it's actually safer to be close then to be far away from each other on track. I like to stay in the mirrors of the guy in front, and move last second, so guy in front knows exactly when I'm going to send it.

So, for as long as I'm in visibile in his mirror he know he can take the corner normal.

If I would not be directly behind him and take the inside line instead for example, he doesn't know when and if I'm going to send it."
Idk how you are getting hit from this but it’s fairly common practice. GT guys should be sliding behind LMP3 once they are passed and grabbing a bit of the draft while they can. Can make a big difference.
"It does make a difference if well timed and executed. It may give you +2kph to the Ligier but having it along the straight could give a few tenths of advantage. In multi class you often lose time overtaking slower cars, it’s great when something like that happens because it helps compensate all the time lost in other overtakes."
"Yea I’ve had multiple assholes in ligers do that to me in that series causing an absolutely unnecessary 4x. Especially on the back straight. They usually end up being disqualified mid-late race, because of getting 17x so karma"
"Because they see pros do it and assume on iRacing everyone is on the same page. The small bit of draft it will produce to just gamble on netcode and the car in front holding it straight. 

I have watched more people get it wrong than right. Only really see it play out well in leagues where people know each other better."
"With you here. It gains what, .1s? Then they blow the braking point by 50m in the next corner. No point in getting so close."
Uhhh...it's called drafting? What are you talking about?
"It's the give and take of multi class. Sometimes traffic gets in the way, sometimes it's a boost pad."
Aspiration is the french word for slipstream
"Yeah watching the last hour of the Daytona 24 really puts it in perspective. The top class driver in second would drop down to get any kind of draft even if he was out of the draft in less than a second. 

&#x200B;

If you are driving multi-class and are in a decent split, I would get use to it."
OP might be French. That's how you say slipstream in French.
absolutey no clue
"If you're in bottom split with any prototype, you'll see things :D"
"I got punted because of this, because this idiot turned too late, I mean I can understand this slipstrem thing you‘re talking about, and I use it also for my class, but you don’t have to late overtake so much that it becomes risky, especially if there is netcode because of you‘re connection"
"> Don't worry, they won't hit you


... *Most of the time*


There's this weird obsession in iRacing with drafting until the last possible moment when approaching a slower class, and then leaving the minimum amount of space. If you watch a real multiclass race, far more room is given almost every time."
"as an aussie, i can tell you netcodes happen for this alot more often then people would care to admit. i have the best interent possible in australia atm, and due to 90% of races being in american servers. we get fucked over alot due to netcode because our ping is always lik 233 or 266.  
so people doing this and leaving bare minimum room can create alot of netcodes for us down here.

but i aree its 100% fairly common, and it happens all the time. but yeah, netcodes happen from it alot"
.1? That’s massive in the world of racing. I qualified 5th in the World Kart Championship 125cc. I was a grand total of 0.018 off pole. Which then meant me starting on the 3rd row
thanks
Thanks.  You learn something new every day!
What split are you in? This sounds like something a low iR driver in a toasted split would do.
"It sucks you got punted, but this is a standard tactic because it's faster. Obviously not faster if you hit someone, that's a LMP3 driver who screwed up. Hopefully they learned more about how long the nose of the car is and won't do it again.

Get used to having faster cars use your draft though."
"In the World Kart Championship, yes .1s is significant. This is iRacing, where pole will qualify 2s faster than 10th. You’re better off focusing on consistency and keeping the car on the track."
">thing you‘re talkin

I usually get to about a cars length and then pull out. You get a tiny bit of draft and it shouldn't be impacting the GT4s. Its places like Daytona where prototypes go past the GT cars with millimeters on the left hand side that annoys me. That is just asking for the net code gods to end your race. 

I will say one thing to the OP, when it happens to you, never try to get out of the way. That is when you will crash!"
tell me how many seconds .1s gained 2 times every lap for 24 hours adds up to
I always try to stay as predictable as I can
2 10ths per lap at daytona is about one and a half laps over 24 hours.
"You’re missing the point of what I’m saying. By waiting for the last possible second to pass, you’re putting yourself and the car you’re passing at unnecessary risk for very little benefit. Unless you’re consistently running alien lap times and you have no other way of going faster, you shouldn’t be doing it."
No one should do anything they can't do safely - if they can do it safely - then go for it.
"I am a noob oval and average road racer who recently discovered Draft Masters.  What a series!  The chaos is insane where you can start at the back and win or be on pole and not survive lap 1.    


This weekend my oval iRating has surpassed my road rating which is crazy.  I am loving oval racing although I don't dare racing the smaller ovals yet, that requires actual skill!

Hear me out... Lift
"Play with ARB and weightjacker. Set a button or encoder on your wheel so you can change them on the fly, assuming you have them. Also, lifting slightly is always an option. Especially if you're getting aero tight."
"Have been, sometimes shifting down to 4th and it still plows tight."
Inconceivable
Been doing huge lifts and even shifting down to 4th sometimes. The Indy fixed series has been my main series for two years so it’s not an experience thing but will definitely experiment with weight jacker more.
"I’ve tried both and headphones are much better for me. I can more easily pick out the difference in tire scrubbing noise to know if I’m under/on/over the limit. 

I’m just now making the transition to wireless headphones, tried some Sennheiser ones but they struggled with interference from other wireless devices nearby. I returned them and am trying the Audeze Maxwells, hopefully no interference issues this time."
5.1 speakers surround sound over headphones/ear buds in my experience. I've never driven faster due to any sound device unless you count my ButtKicker Pro.
"while no science to back this up. i would 100% say yes  
wiht headphoens, youll be bale to hear smaller deaitls that would be drowned out but random backgroud noise when using speakers..that mainly been tires. hearing the tires working harder youll be able to hear when they are scrubbing and make smaller adjustments to fix that

with speakers you can prob hear them, but less so and less impactful due to nosie polution alone. i mean, you could also fight the time it takes to go frome speaker, the snamm distance to the ear (not to mentions refraction of sounds off other surfaces that would make it more muddy) to process and react..its gonna be like .2 of a sec..but that can make a major difference"
"I can't say they make me drive any faster when I'm just putting laps in, but in a close fight they definitely help me hone in on where *exactly* the other car is relative to me. 

I'm sure if I had a proper surround sound kit then the headphone advantage would disappear."
Headphones
"I always drive with headphones for races, leagues etc. Also for voice chat headphones are just a lot easier. But for immersion I blast my 2 floorstanders on high volume. That just does sound better for me."

Impressive. Let’s see the temps and track usage!

I made sure they were identical
So you’d recommend the subscription I imagine?
"Well they weren't identical because it says they're different at the top of your picture lol. That means you probably weren't using static weather which means clouds, wind, etc can all change and have some effect on your times, although probably only a tenth at most, in either direction. Regardless, solid time."
Ya I’ve been using it for years
"I mean it’s negligible, everything was identical but that. good to know about the static weather I’ll do that next time"
Zero difference. No license required to run any AI race.

I was not this driver. I'm the one whose top he bounced off. Poor dude quit out I think.

I have an RTX 2080ti in mine (triple 1440p)
"I just built a 4070ti super/7800x3d for sim racing, I get well over 250 fps in 1080p max settings."
"6600,  dont recommend, in game mirrors dont work and appears im not the only one.  Other than that it gets the job done."
3070. Triple 1440s. Works well
"If you want to buy new, 4070 Super is good value"
"I started a few years ago with a 2070S… recently upgraded to triple 32 inch Samsung G7’s and a 3080ti. 90-100 FPS with most settings with a i9 13900k. 

Planning to grab a 4080S this week and sell the 3080ti to make some of the $ back. My goal is to run everything maxed out, but It depends on your budget of course."
What cpu do you have?
Get a nvidia card no matter what.
Bout to try and sell a used 3060 which could make a good budget entry level on low graphics if you're interested
"Rtx 3080 on triple 32” 1440p. Get about 120-170 in iracing.
100 in ea wrc
I think 80-100 in acc"
I have a 2080 on triples (3x 1920x1200) and it's starting to show its age. But for most cases it still works well... sometimes the FPS dip in the 50-60. Debating on upgrading to a 4080...but $$
"Nice, this is what i was thinking thank you. Would also be running 3x1440"
Same here
Preferably looking for used. Would be in the realm of a “budget” pc since its sole purpose would be racing
Probably the guy in front's wife just got home from work and started asking him questions. 😂
Looked like you were only gonna get one till the spinning guy got back at him.
Don’t you just love it when that happens lol
"This is basically how my first win went. I was a few car lengths behind a closely fighting P1 and P2, who collided into the first corner at Lime Rock and I got around them. The two cars behind me collided while avoiding the incident and the end result was me cruising to victory with a wide margin. I’ll take it!"
Oh yeah mine has definitely cost me a position before
I have it and seldom use it. I recommend avoiding.
It's not very fun to race but it's always more fun watching a track on TV that you've driven.  I don't use it much but don't regret the purchase.
Ai racing is fine but as it’s a very short track id avoid it.
Don't buy. Had the same thought and now my league isn't even running it
It makes for great screenshots at night. 
It should be one of the last ovals you buy. It’s not popular even in short track leagues.
If lik shor trak
I'll probably pass on adding it especially since it'll never get used by me the rest of the year.
"Martinsville and LA Coliseum are horrific in my experience. So many cautions and it’s a complete 50/50 on whether contact is a harmless bump or sends the car spinning, regardless of how light the contact actually is. Some NIS races you can start from the pits at Martinsville and still finish top 10 going through the pitlane every lap."
"Yeah, oval communities tried voting LA Coliseum into NASCAR A/B/C and iRacing just doesn't want to use it. Not really sure why."
"Yep, it's the least most popular oval in both official series and leagues."
"Short tracks don't translate well because contact between cars in iRacing is so unpredictable. Sometimes you can bump them and nothing crazy will happen, sometimes just a light nudge will send someone all the way around.

They should work on getting the contact between cars to be more realistic so these short tracks can be raceable."
"iRacing's telemetry does not provide the data for that type of radar. The best you'll get is the style you can find on the Racelabs and iOverlay overlays, which basically just visualizes overlap but not lateral distance."
"Sure you can do this in simhub.  Just create a new dashboard and use ""Radar Item"".  Size it to however large you want it.  You can also create a MAP in simhub by using ""Dynamic map"" item.  

I built one using both and run it as an overlay in iracing with full background transparency.    AS an added bonus, i use flags as a background, depending on condition :)"
"Don't compromise your own race by moving out of the way - but be smart about it. 

You'll gain no positions fighting people that are lapping you, but you might gain positions by letting them by and then following them closely.

Having someone behind you that you're making angry doesn't really help either if you're not defending for a position."
"Sure you don't have to move out of the way, but if I'm being lapped there's really no point in fighting. I would keep being predictable on the racing line, and lift off a bit during the next straight to let them through."
"Why do you complain that people don't read the sporting code, but then don't provide the full relevant section of the code?

""7.4.2. In all cases, it is the responsibility of the faster car to safely overtake the slower car. It is the responsibility of the slower car to maintain a consistent line. **It is strongly recommended that a slower car being lapped makes every reasonable effort to facilitate a safe pass**.""

You're not obliged to jump out of the way, but if you're being lapped and the leaders attempt to get past you, you're supposed to let it happen rather than just parking it on the racing line."
"If only there was a way to watch actual professionals demonstrate this for, say, 24 straight hours. "
"You can't apply a general rule to all situations that might arise on a racetrack. 

What if I'm getting blue flagged, but I'm 0.2 off the other blue flagged car in front of me?

What if I'm getting blue flagged and I'm damaged and off pace?

What if you're getting blue flagged and I'm fighting with other cars for position on the lead lap? 

What if these situations happen on lap 5? What if they happen on the last lap? 

What if you're nowhere near anyone, I'm nowhere near anyone, and one of us is getting blue flagged? 

Sometimes, it's best to put your ego aside and image you're in the other car and think about what you'd want the lap car to do. 

On ovals, we could be just a few tenths off of each other, and the high line isn't fast enough to allow me to pass you safely. If I was the lap car, then I'd give the leaders the inside.

Another situation on ovals could be that the lapped car has fresher tires than the lead car. Now the lead car is in the way. The lapped car in that case, might even just be lapped because they pit a few laps earlier.

Like, the rule written in the sporting code is perfect for two multiclass cars running alone on a section of the race track, but you can't live by that in every case in every discipline."
Had a guy fight me for positions on Monza multi-class while being on a blue flag. Every single time I would pass him on the straight I would try and get closer to the next guy in front who was less than 4 secs in front. However this blue flag guy kept fighting me for the position. This would cause me to not be able to close in on the next guys draft at all. I don’t understand this mentality. Why do this when you gain nothing.
"If you're in multiclass racing hold your line.

If you're in F4 for example and either fucked your own race already or are so far off pace I'm lapping you don't be sketchy and just let off a bit in the straight. You sound like one of the people who would fight the lead pack tooth and nail only to lock up or lose control and ruin someone's race. There's probably more of a reason you are that far back that isn't just bad luck."
If you are fighting for position with another lapped car I can understand but in any other case if you do not lift a little on the next straight to let the car behind you pass you are a total prick. Sporting code or not.
"Yeah dog I'm not trying to ruin someone's race at the front, especially if it's close. 

I'm pulling over on a straight."
"blue flag - check your mirror, stay on the racing line, be predictable."
"I'm happy to lift and move over on a straight. That's my lot in iracing right now with less time to practice than I'd like. But yeah, dudes who get angry on voice chat and yell ""BLUE FLAG BLUE FLAG"" are maniacs that need anger management therapy."
"For me, it's very simple. Once I get within about a second, I get on the voice chat and I say ""<name>, a little help please?""  And they almost always facilitate a pass.


I always ask like I'm asking them a favor and not demanding and I would say it works 80 to 90% of the time."
"If I get the blue flag then I'm still not moving off the race line. It's up to the other guy to make the pass, I won't be putting up a fight but I'm not jumping out of the way either in most cases."
"Same class, I usually would let them by with no fight if i wasn't in the middle of a fight either. 

Multiclass, I hold my line or let them go by scaraficing a small amount of time. Worth the .5 second vs the 1.5 seconds."
"I always tell them “In all cases, it is the responsibility of the faster car to safely overtake the slower car. It is the responsibility of the slower car to maintain a consistent line."""
"There was a guy the other night. Bottom split of the 9:45 spec racer Ford race. Yelling obscenities at a lapped car in front of him. ""blue flag, blue flag, can't you see? Get the fuck out of the way! I'm going to fucking report your ass!""

My mic was broken. But I typed in the chat after the race ""blue flag is a suggestion in iRacing, but yelling and swearing at people in voice chat is  protestable""

Maybe I should have protested him. Maybe I will. I won the split so I wasn't in the situation, I didn't see it in person, I just heard the swearing. But it was very frustrating to me. I hope the blue flag guy had his voice chat muted I can't imagine being verbally berated during the race would help them stay consistent and predictable."
"I am in rookies now and still very much in the learning stage but one thing that already infuriates me is when I am trying to stay consistent on my line throughout the race and some guy just runs up behind me and wrecks me AND him....doesn't even try to pass. It's almost like they are a bot or something, it's happened several times with different people, etc. It's very strange to me but maybe I'm the asshole (shrugs), LOL."
I just hold my line and give it with lifting i dont change where im at generally but i will lift a little to get it over with
"Absolutely agree it's the responsibility of the passing car - but the number of times a backmarker has wildly defended me, costing me time and ultimately losing me positions.

Happy to wait until the straight and make it easy for both of us, rather than me needing to make a lunge on a less experienced driver."
"This is one of my biggest pet peeves. The dudes who start screaming “blue flag” the moment they see another driver ahead of them in the road. 

Hot lapping and racing are two different disciplines. You can’t really win without being able to put in fast laps; but that’s still only half the story. Being able to race means being able to adapt and deal with traffic. Not just screaming and demanding they move out of the way. If you just want to put really fast laps in and compete on that; do time trials. 

And I can tell you that when it’s my turn to lap people, I just want people to be predictable. If I’m so much faster than you that I’ve been able to completely lap you; then I don’t need any help. What I need is for you to hold your line and be where I can reasonably expect you to be. I’ll get around you. I lose way more time when someone waits until the last second to pull off-line and lift, usually going exactly where I already was because I was planning to pass them on the outside."
"So many daft people on here.

Sure, if a faster car is approaching you don't have to slow down and let them by, but staying glued to the racing line is dangerous.

You'll note that the Sporting Code doesn't mention keeping to the racing line. It talks about a predictable line.

If a car is coming to pass you, a predictable line means staying either on the inside or outside when that car does make the move to pass.

Facilitating the pass is the quickest option for both of you, and if you do it well then you've got a faster car in front of you giving you a tow for a bit."
Mr sporting code forgot to mention part of the code stating the lapped car needs to facilitate a pass as soom as possible.
"Or, you could get your head out of your ass, and let the leaders through."
"Why does everyone take this interpretation to the extreme. 

No you don’t have to jump out of the way and slow down massively. But the smart move is to just take a small lift and let faster traffic go by. 

 “bUt tHe sPOrtInG cOdE SaYs” 

Yeah, and you can walk around a store flailing your arms everywhere and as long as you don’t hit anyone or anything your not breaking any rules, but your still an asshat."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EqifEkKZy4&t=763s

Jimmy explained it pretty well in his latest video. (12:43)"
"I don't care what the sporting code says, if you're getting lapped in a non endurance race get out of the goddamn way"
"If you have a blue flag.. just move out of the way when you see the approaching vehicles. Chances are one is getting blue because their race is already hurt, no need to hurt someone else's race over that.

No need to make it harder on the faster car that didn't mess up their laps."
I'll always move as long as it doesn't lose me a bunch of time or a position to the guy that already let him by. Lol
"Well, at least on a dirt oval, you should move to the bottom of the track, and the most important part is holding your line. Yes, the car passing you should not expect  to dive to the bottom of the track and wreck both of you. Or yell at you to get out of the way  but pass you responsibly."
"Ok, serious question. I had a situation the other day at Hungaroring in F4. I was behind someone who was being lapped, and I was a bit faster but couldn't pass him. At on point, coming out of turn 4, he had an awful exit. I came up alongside him, but instead of letting me go, he continued pushing and got his elbows out as if he was fighting for positions. If it had been normal racing for position, it for sure would have been tough, but completely fair from him. But does the sporting codes dictate then that he was allowed to do that if he was being lapped?"
"The main thing here is “consistent line”. So many times a lapped car is being lapped because he’s all over the road. If a blue flagged car is hard to pass because he’s unpredictable, then I’m definitely going to be yelling at him to get out of the way."
"I don't expect anyone to jump out the way, but I do expect them to facilitate the pass when I make a move. If they don't do that, and hold me up for more than a lap and it matters (I'm trying to close or maintain a gap, not just circulating), I'm going to miss a brake point ever so slightly (oops, my bad) and simply move them out of the way. Cash in some of that SR I have in the bank from endurance racing.

Yeah, I know, I'm a Bad Man and I'm going to hell."
"When I'm about to get lapped.

Road: I pull into pits and wait.

Oval: I go below yellow line and slow down to drive carefully and get back on track after everyone passes."
"No blue flags but racing in Indycar at Atlanta Motor Speedway, car multiple laps down, has damage, running 2.5 secs slower and 30 mph off the pace takes me out because he initially gets tight as I go high to pass him into turn 3 then I go low as he gathers it up and he goes low and we crash as my closing speed is so much greater than him. He has the audacity to use this same justification that he was in the right."
Most of the times people that yells blue flags just want you to move out of the way because they hate to admit they don’t know how to overtake safely
"Yeah, I mean not much more to add that hasn't already been said except for one thing.

When I'm being lapped I always make it as easy and as safe as possible. Slight lift on the straight and tuck in behind, often into the apex. Loses the least amount of time for both parties. 

The main point I wanted to add though, if this is a league race (typically) and I'm being lapped by the leader, my attitude would be to 'pay it forward'. Next time it could be me lapping them when I'm fighting for the lead. A lot of drivers will treat others with respect when they too have been given respect on track.

It's not always the case, but there are a lot more respectful drivers out there than not in my experience. It's just that, in officials at least, you'll always encounter the crazy ones."
"The problem is, if I hold my line and brake when I would normally brake, there is a good chance that is earlier than the car lapping me would brake and they’ll probably end up hitting me. I’m a relatively new player and i’m trying to get my SR up so I’d rather get well out of the way than risk it."
"As always using your brain helps tremendiously. It's all about risk-reward. But in the case of a blue flag overtake, there is absolutely no reward, none. So the smart thing to do in that scenario is to minimize risk. And also as racers, minimize time loss. So let the faster car through, but only by the slightest margin possible. Ideally you are right on their bum on the apex and out of the corner"
"I had a guy in a league race behind me on track lapping me for a while and I wasn't actively defending my position. We were passing slower classes of car on Road Atlanta, and heading into T5 he flashed his lights, which put me off, I lost control and he as a result got crowded out on the exit and he touched the wall. Didn't end his race but he had a real go at me afterwards, protested me (nothing came of it so I assume I was deemed not in the wrong) and yeah, really amazed by him thinking he was in the right."
"So I do not know why, but it took me until this year's Rolex 24 in person to realize that blue flags are basically nonexistent IRL apart from F1. In multiclass racing they are just used to alert that a car is exiting the pits. Other than that, they are not really used.

I agree with you. Unfortunately, F1 has given everyone the wrong impression of what blue flags are, when in reality they are not a move out of the way flag."
"Its on you to help facilitate the pass though. If I'm lapping a car, within 2 tenths and move to the inside for a breaking zone I expect the lapped car to help me by lifting slightly earlier and not racing me in that corner."
"My team handled this in the 24 by having someone who wasn't driving, politely messaged the lapped car.

We had a number of times we got held up by slow cars in our class. Asked them politely not to fight us, in most cases they pulled off or let off the throttle early to let us through. We had a pretty respectful split all things considered."
"I think if the car behind is obviously quicker and in a podium battle, it's the right thing to let people pass. I'm a road racer, but I've recently got into ovals and have been letting leaders in street stock by all the time by just shifting my line as they are clearly faster. Ideally without ruinijg my back of the field battles. 

Conversely I've been pretty good at the Legends 34 on Charlotte this week, I'm patient and respectful and look for opportunities to pass, and for the most part the back markers get out my way when they can, by just running wide on the corner... But! I had one guy who refused to budge. Now he was quick, I was only half a sec per lap faster, which is enough to catch up and lap by lap 30. I was second, first was out of reach, and I'd put a 4 sec gap in to 3rd. Would this guy let me past? Nope. There's two corners on Charlotte, and with half a second per lap in it, there's no real way to force a pass. I'd pressure until he made a mistake, but every time I got along side he turned like I wasn't there, so I had to back out or we would wreck. Finally he runs wide, I pass, and he dive bombs back in on the next corner, I have to run wide to avoid contact and he's back in front, holding me up. By the final corner my 4 sec gap to 3rd is gone, 3rd is quite literally bumping my bumper, giving me a nice 4x whilst the back marker is holding us both up.  I  managed to keep second, but why did he battle with me for 10 laps - if he'd driven less dangerously I'd have been by easily, and had a 1 sec gap within two laps, instead he almost ruined my race with really aggressive driving when he wasn't even fighting for position. It really wound me up. I've done a lot of racing at Charlotte and USA in Rookies this week - in fact I went from Rookie to B in three days. It's been a lot of clean respectful fun, until this guy -  he's clearly a Blue doesn't mean I let you by believer. It certainly doesn't mean you ignore me and drive recklessly to actively prevent leaders passing. Had I not backed out numerous times, he'd have wrecked us both, such was his desire to not let me past. He wasn't a rookie, he doesn't have ignorance on his side. "
"I call it “managing the tilt”, because even drivers who are quite patient can end up tilting and pulling a bonehead move to try to get past. The likelihood increases every time you close the door or run defensive. It’s just wise to remember that the other drivers are human, and most humans have their decision-making clouded by massive frustration."
"Fwiw, a bit harder to do with people that don't understand the concept, but a passing car should ""present"" themselves to the side they want to pass, and then the car being passed such ideally brake earlier into the next turn to allow the faster car by. It's better for you to let people by in braking zones. Lifting on corner exit is unexpected for others usually and also hurts you much more."
"I agree with you on 98%, other 2% I disagree because, sometimes we can be on last lap, fighting for position and leader is coming with comfortable gap to P2 (5-6 sec). Can he not expect to easy way or even do not put his car into laped cars who fighting for position? I think yes.

But in other cases, laped car just can lift off and give the way for lead lap cars because, just we all be gentle."
"Depends on the context. 

If I spun off and I’m dead last and about to get lapped? I’m going to lift and move over. 

If I’m fighting for 5th and 6th is right on my bumper and there’s an alien coming up behind both of us whose pace is so fast that he’s going to end up lapping the field? Yeah— no. Not only will me not lifting and moving over not affect his race; but it’ll also detrimentally affect my race. I’m definitely not going to block or defend but I’m going to stay on the best line."
"This is more a reply to the replies you're getting, rather than your comment itself. 

I've been in a situation where I got taken out in T1 and had to track down the lower positions from quite a ways back and I was being lapped. I'd say I was like 5th fastest in the race, so fast enough to catch P10 and down but not fast enough to fight the leaders. Some would argue that you shouldn't move out of the way because you're fighting, the smart folk would say let the leader through as quickly as possible and hang onto them, wait for *them* to catch the cars you want to pass, and take advantage of their blue flag situation.

Fighting the leader will *always* lose time. It's guaranteed. So why lose time when you can pick up some draft and maybe learn how to be a bit faster by watching the leader? It's a no-brainer. Yes, you don't *have* to move but you definitely should for everyone's sake. There's a very specific and not super common situation where you might not want to move over and that's on the last lap and you're about to catch the person in front of you. And in that case, unless the leader is also fighting, the leader would be smart to hang back. I know I always try to maintain enough speed to keep in front but not to catch lapped cars late in the race because I've been taken out so many times by lapped cars. At best I'm gonna lose some time anyway."
Well unless you're oval racing. I'll definitely try pretty hard not to go a lap down in the hopes that a caution comes out.
"This is also what I would do….IF I raced anything other than AI racing. But with me being an AI racer, I would act like I was going to let them pass and then pit maneuver them when they got alongside."
"“Every reasonable effort” doesn’t mean “move the f over” like some people think it means. 

Reasonable is the keyword. It’s not reasonable to move off-line and slow down when you’re fighting for position. But it might be reasonable to do exactly that if you’re 30 seconds ahead of the next driver.

As long as you’re holding your line and not aggressively defending, you’re doing the right thing. People who don’t know how to pass aren’t entitled to have you sacrifice your race to coddle them."
"I was going to say this, thank you. People only read the first part and make it an absolute rule. If you're dangerous and cause an crash while a leader overtakes you, it's your fault"
"I agree that you're not supposed to fight an overlap scenario. totally let it happen, but let it happen naturally, as opposed to ""pull over to the side, lift off a bit, and let them through"" as I think many angry voice radio people seem to be asking for. 

facilitate a pass but don't stop racing is my thought. lead car should be fast enough, and in control enough, to overtake a steady, on the racing line blue flag car. if you're going bumper to bumper behind a blue flag into a corner because ""its the racing line"" then its your fault when you get a 4x"
"Right? I watched a good chunk of the Daytona 24 and some of the folks in here, insisting that faster cars automatically own the track or expecting people to ‘move over’ would be shocked if they saw real multi-class racing!"
In every case you mentioned you still need to keep following a consistent line.
"In my experience, people only yell at backmarkers when they're ACTIVELY causing problems, myself included.  On multiple occasions I've been in the front pack fighting for podium only for us to get logjammed by backmarkers who decide the cars trying to lap them need to be involved in their slapfight for last."
"Moving over is not being consistent with your racing line. 

The problem is everyone moves off line differently (and everyone thinks the other driver understands it in the same way)."
"Being nice goes a long way. Being rude, often just makes people want to be less helpful."
Moving off line is unpredictable and the last thing I want from someone I'm passing is them being unpredictable.
"I won't move off the racing line, I learned my lesson from that (one time I moved off it as the guy behind me moved off it to pass me, essentially blocking him, so I moved back to the racing line as the guy also moved back) learned my lesson there.

However I will lift a tiny bit just for them to hurry up and pass me, having them on my ass the whole race is not great."
Yeah that's why you let them past.
"You can stay glued to racing line and slow down to let them pass. 

The two are not mutually exclusive. 

Feel free to move off the line once they are passing you.  Doing it beforehand creates confusion."
"It’s not as dangerous for the guy being lapped, if someone lapping me wants to drive like a hero into my rear end, it hurts them a lot more than me lol. 

It’s the passers job to pass."
"tbh this is what I googled. the first result only listed what I wrote. not really a good excuse since I can't exactly say ""read the sporting code fools!!"" while only half remembering the sporting code myself 😅

https://preview.redd.it/8sw5kw5w88fc1.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f36e437af1eaf1428f09fc6d42ffa92d91b75dc"
"They do not *need* to facilitate a pass whatsoever. It's a recommendation, and it's entirely situational.

In any series with full-course cautions, it makes sense to defend against the leader to make sure you stay on the lead lap. Even in iRacing, it can make a difference towards the end of the race. If you're in 10th and the 9th place car is 20 seconds up the road, you might say ""why not just let the leader by?"" -- but if anyone crashes on the final lap, you will gain that position as long as you haven't been lapped. It happened in the [2022 Detroit race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9TybcojZtc&t=22m19s), the commentators were wondering why Jack was fighting so hard to stay on the lead lap, but then he gained a position on that final lap from a crash."
The lapped car is not allowed to fight to keep the position or actively defend it. It’s one thing for the blue flagged car to stay on his line and not lift. It’s completely different if the car making the pass has an opportunity and the blue flagged car actively defends the pass.
Hold your line. The faster car will easily pass you if you’re braking early.
"So many GT drivers don’t understand this because of the “faster car is always responsible to overtake cleanly” line that gets parroted so much.

You will save both cars a lot of time by being generous and helping facilitate a pass. It’s also more likely to keep you alive"
This. But the problem is most lapping cars just stay on the ass of the lapped car while yelling for them to move out of the way. Such odd behavior.
"Jup thats smart driving. Always try to gain as much time as possible and try to minimise time lost. Going side-by-side into the corner messes the whole corner and next straight up, you loose a lot of time - not good. Lift, let them by in the braking zone, drive the corner on the racing line, get some tow on the straight, time loss minimized - good"
"Also most blue flags are for incoming people in faster classes. If I’m battling for P2 in GT4, you can bet mister P14 in LMP3 behind will wait the next straight line for me to let him pass me."
"Agreed. It’s all context of the specific situation. Example: You’ve had repairs at the start of the race and go back out to salvage some IR/SR. You re-enter the race in front of a battle for position, but you’re running the same laptimes as the cars battling and you’re not holding anyone up. I’ve been in this situation a few times and I’ll always ask the guys battling over voice chat if they want me to move over. Most of the time they are so focused on their own battle that they don’t care. 

But if you’re laps down and refuse to move over for a lead lap car that is in a battle, you’re a jerk. You may be technically in the right by the letter of the rules, but you’re still a jerk."
"I don't care what lap it is, if I'm fighting for position the faster car figure it out. Especially in multiclass if I'm GT3."
"Moving off line is not being consistent. 

Everyone interprets “moving off line” differently and that ends up causing accidents."
"I wish I had more than one upvote to give this comment.

If I'm being lapped, and they attempt an overtake on the inside, it is perfectly reasonable for me to brake a bit early and let them by, because it will only slow us both down if I try to keep it two wide through a turn. 

Lifting on a straight when my opponent is just a couple seconds back? Not gonna happen. 30 seconds back? I'm happy to help."
"Keep in mind that somebody who is laps ahead of you has more important business than you. Just facilitate an overtake at the next good opportunity, or make it super easy for them if they line up an overtake themselves.

It’s not rocket science and it won’t cost you more than a few tenths if you do it right."
">Reasonable is the keyword. It’s not reasonable to move off-line and slow down when you’re fighting for position. But it might be reasonable to do exactly that if you’re 30 seconds ahead of the next driver.

Mmm nah. Reasonable is get out of the way ASAP. Any incident or loss of positions for other racers by bearing held up or interrupted is protestable under unsporting behaviour.

If you're choosing to be indignant and cause an incident, you're getting protested."
"There's a middle ground. I agree, it doesn't mean pull over and park it, but also don't defend and don't be a little bitch about it. Just yield in the braking zone and facilitate the pass and both can move on."
Which you will not be doing if you follow a consistent line.
"The only time I've heard someone complain over the mic is when they don't understand the rules.

> their slapfight for last

The fight for ""not last"" is just as important as the fight for first. Every position gains you IR.

If you are a single car that's trying to pass two lap-down cars fighting each other for position, neither of them is required to let you by. Every real-life endurance race you will see a side-by-side GT battle that a prototype has to sit behind for *multiple* corners in a row, because the track is only wide enough for two cars. That's just unfortunate timing on the prototype's side, the GT cars have every right to battle each other."
[deleted]
"Yeah, that's fair, but I'm also not a dope, and I'll move and lift on long straights for faster drivers when I know I'm gonna be slower in the upcoming braking zone. In my experience, it's better than being punted by impatient drivers."
"So if a guy opts to pass you on the inside into a corner and you blindly follow the racing line, you think that he'll come out of it worse off?

The fastest way for you both to get around the track is to work together. Showing a total disregard for the faster car is just stupid driving imo."
Not talking about oval
"Thanks for the input. If it had been racing for positions im he for sure would have been considered as having put his elbows out but still within rules, but good to know for the future."
In my (fairly limited) experience they tend to drive into the back of me!
"Yep, most GT drivers read that as “I should act as if faster classes should only pass on straights”"
Especially in an endurance event.
It’s because the “faster” car doesn’t know how to handle the situation so they just demand the “slower” car slow down and reverse pass them.
For me they just plow me in the back even though I'm trying so hard to let them pass
"I agree. When I’m the car doing the lapping I just want the car in front to keep a solid line. And I DON’T want them to lift. I’m making a plan to pass them like I would any other slower car. If they lift it makes them unpredictable (unless they’re lifting on a straight perhaps)

IF you want to lift and move over, do it on a straight. But otherwise keep your foot down and hold your line."
That is absolutely not how racing works. At all.
"No. That isn’t how racing works. 

Again; I’m not talking about defending or blocking. A lapped car absolutely shouldn’t be doing that. 

But no— they don’t have to move over or slow down for a faster car. Racing means negotiating other vehicles. You need to facilitate a safe pass, both drivers do. 

The sporting code spells it out. No need for the generic catch-all when the sporting code itself specifically details blue flagged cars. In fact; it says that a lapped car needs to HOLD its line. Which is quite the opposite of “moving over”."
"Yeah I just interpret it as ""be as predictable as possible"" but I usually lift off a little or go more outside on corners to let leaders pass."
"Moving over is not being consistent. It is literally taking a different line, new line. 

How do you think the driver behind you is going to know what new (inconsistent) line you are going to take?

They can’t read your mind."
"If he’s lapping me, he’s got a lot more to lose. I don’t pay complete disregard, because I’m usually pretty focused on safety rating.

I’ve also seen most leaders be pretty sensible on the pass so they don’t ruin their race.

Rules are clear though. I’m not going to block and race someone. But it’s not my obligation to take action to let them past. I’ll typically lift on a straight so I can focus on my own driving. But if some hero flies up in a corner and wants to make a move, he’s got a lot more to lose than the car he’s lapping."
"I'm aware, which is why most of that paragraph was talking about a road course race that went caution-free, but staying on the lead lap still mattered."
"the argument goes the other way too - that the faster classes treat the slower classes like their race is less important.  If I have a competitor on my rear bumper and I'm racing for position, I'm not lifting for anything. Faster class needs to be patient and find their way around me. However, if I'm out there with a gap and no one racing me, go right through."
"You can tell the people who have been racing who are actually faster, or used to racing multiclass vs. the people here who just bitch that they don't get clean track handed to them lol.

The LAST thing I want you to do is to let off that gas pedal or suddenly move off line. I'm literally passing some people like they're crawling and the very last thing I want is for them to suddenly move over because they see me in the mirror."
"How does it work then? Fighting people who are laps ahead of you and faster than you toe and nail for… nothing at all, just added risk?"
"Rules also say it is strongly recommended to let them pass, OP just ""forgot"" to add that part."
Also though if those coming up to lap in multiclass are in a tight fight with each other I’ll generally make the effort to get out of their way so as not to interfere in their fight but also because they’ll be paying much less attention to me than usual.
"1000%. 

Hotlapping and racing are two different things. iRacing has a time trial system if you just want to put fast laps in without having to deal with traffic."
"Please re-read my comments. That might help. 

I have not suggested “fighting” with leaders. 

I’ve merely said that you need to hold your line and race your race. And that lapping cars need to pass safely like they would any other car. It isn’t the responsibility of the lapped car to go off-line, lift, or otherwise accommodate the lapping car.

If you come upon a car that holds its line, and you’re faster, and you interpret their predictable moves as “fighting”, then you might have some single lap pace, but you don’t possess any race craft at all. Racing isn’t merely lapping fast. It’s lapping fast AROUND other cars. Including be able to adjust and adapt to traffic."
"Because it's merely a recommendation. There's a balance between aggressively defending anyone who tries to lap you, and pulling over between anyone who tries to lap you. The people who shout over the mic are usually asking lap-down cars to do the latter, because that's what they think is required."
"The thing I disagree with is that lapped cars fighting each other makes it unreasonable for them to facilitate a safe pass (as per the sporting codes wording). If that is how I can read your original comment. I might have misunderstood!

What I expect as the lapping and faster car is that I can get by without too much trouble. I never expect anybody to go off line, but I expect that the lapped cars don’t put up a fight when I line up an overtake. Also, a little partial lift at the right spot is appreciated and minimises time loss for both - it’s a win-win, the smartest thing to do. This also applies when the lapped cars fight.

What I do as the lapped car while fighting myself is to let off the fight and facilitate the faster car passing, just as if I weren’t fighting. In 9 out of 10 cases, my fight continues very soon after anyway - I don’t lose anything except for unnecessary risk introduced by the faster car right behind me that I’m not even fighting.

There are edge cases, like very last lap and passing car is well clear of competition, sure. There are always edge cases - just being in a fight usually isn’t one is what I’m trying to say."
"You seem to be of the opinion that faster drivers have more right to the track than slower drivers (you’ve even said as much). And that’s why you can’t wrap your head around the idea of two cars fighting for position not just giving up and discarding their race so that you don’t lose any time. 

No, that’s absolutely not how racing works. At all. The sporting code is pretty clear on this one. Hold your line and make a reasonable effort to facilitate a pass. That’s it."
"Yeah we disagree about that then. I stand by that comment - not your re-wording, I wouldn’t put it like that, but my original comment. And it’s not like I don’t find myself in the being lapped situation often - I do, as I run lots of enduros. And I do feel that I need to be a bit humble in that situation. All within reason, obviously - but our interpretations of “reasonable” seem way different.

That’s alright at least in the case of iRacing, as the sporting code doesn’t detail this any further. There’s room for interpretation, and thus room for arguing.

I’m not mad at all btw, if you read that into my comments you read that wrong. (This was answering to the comment you just deleted, where you wrote that I just wanted to be mad at something.)"
"Is your UI Full screen? The tables are now responsive so making the window wider will show more columns.

use the Series List page (and sort by Registration Expires if you want to specifically look for races about to start) or click on the name of any row you want to on that Up Next page and the window that appears will show the license.
"this was it, didn't realize my UI scale was a bit larger than normal. thank you!"
I was having this issue in the mx5 and have been working on it the past week. View a replay of your fastest lap and see how much of the track you’re not using. For example: I’m practicing on Okayama for week 8 and there’s one corner where I could’ve positioned the car approx. 3 feet to the right without gaining an incident point and once I started doing that my laps were two tenths faster.
"The best way for me to learn is to just get out on track and feel it out, then try to put a bunch of laps down. Once I start getting too sloppy I reset and watch a couple of my laps. I also use Garage 61 to record my telemetry and compare it to other drivers near my skill level that are faster. You are also stretching new muscles. Walk away for a bit if you hit a wall, even sleep on it. 

(I forgot this) Use practice sessions with other drivers. Follow someone who is faster, and if you just can’t a corner spectate someone or just ask someone who is there and they may help you through tough corners.

Most importantly, don’t compare yourself to the fastest drivers. Nothing will ruin your motivation quicker than comparing yourself to people that are seconds faster."
"This is what i do.  Youtube track guides (using this for positioning and brake points), hit the track, try to get within 1-1.5 seconds kinda consistently.  Then garage 61 or VRS to dig a little deeper.   I've found that I can't do everything the same in the track guides so try not to limit myself by copying them exactly.  Then hop into practice sessions with people.  If I'm unfamiliar with the track I might do 50-100 laps before getting into a race."
IMO you need to start looking at telemetry to see where you can carry more speed.
"When I started I would find established content creators who would provide their ghost car for download. Once I had a basic understanding of the track, I would load the ghost car and see if I could maintain or even beat its time. Definitely helped me with Mugello and Charlotte Roval."
Shorter is faster
"Did you get any abnormal lap messages or anything? Just geussing really, but if you did, those lap times wouldn't have counted and maybe would have credited the lead to 2nd for that lap?"
"Oh, as the matter of fact I did! Don’t remember  the exact reason for it though… That’s quite interesting behavior from the system"
I recall during the 24 there were some timing lines that could be missed which would momentarily change change on track positions on the relative and standings. Once you went through the next timing line it went back to normal.
"In RaceLab you can find one. Numbers of lap, lap time for every lap, track temperature on every lap and fuel consumption on every lap.

Or you can use garage61 service, or VRS service (but for free limited amount of time that you can spend on service)."
My only complaint with Crew Chief is his timing. I don't need to hear I need to fight harder when I just got punted.
I use the DWarehouse Jimmie Johnson cuss spotter pack. Having Chad Kanus and Earl in my ear makes for a calming race to me. Even when you hit a wall and Chad yells at you makes it feel realistic.
"Don't have beef Crew Chief directly, but few years back I reported a bug or weird behaviour and response was 'well, don't use it' so I just stopped reporting anything and now that iRacing  built-in thing has autofuel option there really isn't need to use CC anymore.  

Might be iRacing data issue or Crew Chief, but I always find it idiotic that when you pass someone the spotter says 'so and so is catching up, the gap is...' Well no shit, I just passed him of course he is closer than previous guy."
I fired jIm after discovering JJ.  Best spotter ever.
I think both already work extremely well. Not sure you will find many who will need anything else.
"I want to hear about incidents across the track and at what corner.
And for yellow flags to be given a sector. 

I just like to hear about all the chaos, not just what is immediately in front of me"
It tilts me a lot with lap times spam and remembering me every single off track even in close fights. I tried to configure it but some options are too much even with low values. After 3 or 4 years with it I'm back with iRacing's spotter tbh.
"""2 mins left,"" as I'm about to cross the finish line.
""We aren't sure your current fuel load will make it, we might have to fuel save"", me with 1-1.5L of fuel extra. 
The disjointed ""we have, 2, laps, to qualify"""
"I'd like custom reminders...

i.e.

When you leave the pits a reminder you have cold tyres

A reminder the limiter is NOT ON if you enter a car in an endurance race

A reminder at Nords that if you've gone past Exmühle and not Bergwerk you are NOT on the full throttle bit! :D"
"I mostly stopped using it because A) it constantly addresses me as a dude and B) apart from yelling me how fuel I'm using per lap via audio, and lap tines of those around me iracing has it now. 

Only time I use it is for now multiclass because it's better about faster car approaching warnings."
"I like crew chief but it always seems to get pit exits wrong, also last night it told me to push because I’d lose the position, but I was 12 secs ahead of the guy behind me with 2 laps remaining. Definitely a time to manage, not push."
"Ever since iRacing added in the auto fuel thing, I've had 0 use for crew cheif. Crew chief is honestly quite annoying now that I haven't used it for thing long. "
"Priorities can be really weird with CC, like some info is just not relevant sometimes. Also, I tried making a custom voice pack for CC and it was an absolute pain to adhere to it's strict audio format which often doesn't even make sense."
"You especially gotta love when the next car ahead is 30 seconds away with 1 lap left but:

""push! We can catch this guy!""

""Common send it already!"" (there's not a single soul in sight)"
"And with the latest updates from iracing regarding triggering of the spotter, I don't feel I need anything else."
I use the same pack and I absolutely love it. Don’t think I’ll ever use something different.
Does it work well for road races too?
There is a setting to be gender neutral. Not sure when it was added.
Yeah multi class is the main reason I keep it too
"somehow scrape into the top split of 30 cars as car no. 30, finish 7th, celebrate wildly

""oh, better luck next time mate"""
Same. I had to re-download iracing after a 5yr hiatus and was using TJ and Steve. It just wasn't the same. Had to re-download the JJ spotter pack.
"Yes, it works well for road, oval, dirt oval and dirt road."
I've heard of it but couldn't find the option.
"Yeah, some awareness of our ranking relative to the other drivers would be great. Even though now that I think of it, they do say every once in awhile ""we are where we thought we'd be.""  Is that based on qualifying or irating?"
"""nevermind."""
I love when he asks where the hell Earl is at the start of a race lmao
In the Properties list there is a search box in the top right. Type 'refer' in there. Turn off the checkbox. save and reload.
"Found it, thank you."
You shouldn't have crashed
Hey man you’re missing a wheel. Super tough to compete til you get it back
"In retrospect, I should have aimed where he was, not where he was going into the mustard lol."
nope. if it's a road series than you only need that road license and what your oval license is doesn't matter for signup. thought it will be what is affected.
But does competing in a road series race on an oval track affect your SR and licence level for oval? Because that's surely ripe for exploitation.
"series category decides to what license you need to race it.

track type decided what license gets affected.

road series on an oval track affects oval ratings.

oval series on a road track affects road ratings.

i think i've seen some debate over it on the forums but only rarely"
You are correct that it affects the SR and licence for the track you're on but I'm wondering how you think this this is ripe for exploitation? This isn't something new
What about IR?
"Wow! Alright that's a huge loophole.

Thank you for your help here. Hugely appreciated!"
"Because imagine someone sees the news that the Indy 500 is returning but don't have the licence requirements. Maybe a rookie and Class D series hasn't got as good driving standards so they just compete in a few road series' oval races instead. 

Surely they'd gain more SR for that than a rookie or Class D oval series, right?"
Same deal. Safety rating and irating based on track type. Race entry based on Series type.
yeah that in this case falls under license as well. ir and sr affected depend on the track type
"You can't get promoted without running the minimum amount of races for that particular class. 2 for rookies. 4 for D+. And you can only get promoted within a season with a very high SR.

 If you're getting experience and SR on ovals by running ovals (with a road licence) and hitting the MRP in the Rookie and D to get to C for the 500 I'm not sure how that's different than just running all Rookie & D ovals. You're gonna have to run the same amount of corners either way because SR is based on the amount of turns not race length."
main advantage really running something on the higher up road license would  be longer race distances
It's really not very hard to license up if your only concern is safety rating. I went from rookie to B license in road in two weeks so I could do endurance races.  I am normally an oval driver.
"So you’re saying if someone grinds oval safety rating in Indy cars for the Indy 500 that would be exploitation? The Indy ladder are the only road cars that have guest oval weeks right?

I’d much rather race the Indy 500 with people with only Indycar oval experience than someone coming over with an A4.99 Oval made up exclusively of stock car races whom is stepping into an Indycar for the first time. "
"I agree with this, I just couldn't figure out how to word it. Whichever way you get oval license, your still running ovals and getting oval experience."
"Ah yes that is the main benefit, you're right"
"Oh don't put words in my mouth. I'm merely saying that it would probably be easier to gain oval SR in road series' oval races than going into the rookie and D oval series.

I'm just pointing it out because it seems like that's not working as intended."
lotus 49 i think has an oval week or 2
Indycar is a dang C license. If you’ve raced Atlanta this week you’d have seen the shitshow that restarts and wheel to wheel racing have been until attrition sets in and only the good drivers remain
"If you have a rookie oval license and hop into USF2000/IP2000/Indy Road on oval, you’re going to find it harder to gain SR than if you went the traditional stock car route IMO. The cars are very fragile and the driving standards are just as bad at low iRatings."
"Got it. Alright thank you for letting me know that.

I know I did an unranked pickup race and got involved in a few incidents, not even intentional on my part. If that had been ranked, I'm sure I'd have gone down to -1"
"Which track?

I ask because pickup cup has some *extremely* different styles of tracks. A lot of road drivers hopping into oval don’t realize how broad the category can be and hop into a race at Daytona and get the wrong ideas"
"Yeah it was Daytona. Only reason I did it. A teammate of mine is really into oval racing ATM and she told me that the series Draftmasters take place exclusively at Daytona and Talladega. So I decided to do it since I own Daytona for the 24 hour race.

Honestly, big respect to oval racers. I don't have the nerve or seemingly the etiquette for it."
"Last lap on second green-white-checkered. Last race of the week, drivers pushing too hard for the win. I sat back in 7th and created space but still got collected"
Dinoco is all mine
I was going to jump on the 8 pm cst race tonight but my sciatic nerve needed a breather after doing three races at Talladega in the 1987's since Friday. It always sucks being in the top 10 with less than 5 laps left because you know the carnage is always just around the corner. That's what gets the blood a pumpin' though.
Yes cold tires
"They’re not any colder than in the pit lane when you first start out in practice or whatever but when you see everyone else taking off it’s easy to push harder than you should. 

It takes a solid 2-3 laps on most tracks to get to maximum grip levels."
"This is soooo common, especially in the rookie MX-5 series. People don’t understand that tyres are cold af before a race start, especially a standing start. They proceed to push as if it’s a quali lap and end up with half the grid out on lap 1. Please take it easy with entry speed, braking, throttle application and steering inputs for the first couple laps. BUILD UP GRADUALLY, as you feel more grip. For example, the MX-5 doesn’t take more than 1-2 laps to heat up its tires, wheras the ff1600 takes 4-5. Learn this in practice"
Drive carefully the first few laps until tires get up to temp.
"Little Johnny has two Porsche cup cars, one he warms the tires with a slow pace lap, the other he leaves sat on the line. Which car has warmer tires?"
"You may be spinning the rears too much at the start which spikes the surface temps on the rears at which point you're driving on cold fronts and rears that have a cold core temp but molten surface temp. 

This would be the worst of both because the fronts would understeer savagely and then you get on throttle and loop out."
Even colder than when pitting out during practice? How can I practice driving on those insanely cold tires? Do I make an AI race?
"Adding onto this, in a test drive you can use active reset which resets the car back to its location AND state. If you want to practice on cold tires you can set the reset point to any spot on the track and go over and over again."
"Take it easy. Keep your inputs smoother and keep in mind everything takes longer. You need to brake a bit earlier and go on the throttle more conservative. 

If you overdo it in 1 corner, back it down seriously for at least half a lap in the pcup. This counts for every mistake, if you don't back down, everything will be inconsistent ice for the rest of the race."
Just take it easy first couple laps
"I don’t need active reset to get plenty of practice on cold tires. I do a fine job putting it into the wall or spinning and ruining them myself, thank you very much."
"Woooooah. That would explain a lot. So if I'm driving at like 10/10 and I make a mistake, say lighting up the rears... how much should I dial it down to? 7/10?"
Honestly I just pretend I'm not even racing first lap and focus on not killing me or others.
"Hard to say. You will feel the difference and feel your tyres getting back to you by experience. 

Practice it, go too quickly on the throttle on the corner exit, make a big drift and then try to get your tyres back to normal. If you do this for 10 times you will get it."
"I pretend I’m playing a bullet hell game the first round mostly, starts are crazy scary."
Pretty hard to do that when you're in the top 5 and people are practicing stumbling over each other to pass you.
"Yeah I struggle with this, first corner normally just pray and hold the inside line.

If on the outside it's generally guaranteed death, not sure what the thinking with people is with the first corner rush, same people that stand up the moment a plane lands I think."
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
"As someone before me said, avoid 1st gear in the Mx5 and be mindful of the engine rpm’s when downshifting. If you downshift too quickly your tires will spin out. 

Also better to brake early and use engine braking when possible. Braking late usually leads to mistakes and crashes."
"Watch this video by Suellio Almeida  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99aI\_m45RtU&t=36s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99aI_m45RtU&t=36s), then watch his technique series.

"Miata series has no TC and no ABS if I remember correctly. A tip I got from my brother who races his own car a lot IRL, don’t use first gear except for the pits and the starts, it’ll keep you from spinning out, even with the Miata I would lose the back end in the slow corners of Okayama. Did this, didn’t have a problem and still able to roll good speed."
Thanks for the tips!  Just going to keep at it.  Best way for me to learn personally is by doing it.
Okayama with the Miata for the first time is really tricky. I still can’t figure out for the life of me how to do a 1.45 on that track after months of racing the mx5. Good idea to do AI races for a while lol
I think first gear is quite usable in the mx5
it does have abs. i haven't driven it in a bit but no tc really wasn't a lot of issue because it just doesn't really have the power to easily spin the wheels. it's just much more likely to start oversteering off throttle
I was slipping a lot this past week at Oukton Park when I went down to first. Do you change your brake bias or anything?
"There is no corner at oulton where you should use 1st but in tighter hairpins its useful, the back to back hairpins in okoyama for example"
I was trying to go down to 1st in the chicanes at Oulton. I’ll give it an another shot this week at Okayama.
Yeah should be good at okoyama. Just dont downshift too early and check that you have auto-blip turned on or blip the throttle yourself on downshifts to avoid excessive engine braking
"It’s the exact same cars as the A class NASCAR which will also be the C class NiS cars. The Next Gen Camry, Mustang and Camaro."
Try to stay in the bottom lane. You always have the escape rout of the apron. Find a place in line and ride until like 10 to go
It would be the next gen
"It will be a C class series, the schedule should be coming out sometime between this week and next week but in reality it’s pretty much just the cup series schedule (no clash) and it uses the next gen cars, not the gen 6. For Daytona you want to qualify for me I just feel like when I go to those types of places it makes me feel better that I know what speed I have in qualifying and it’s just good to see where you stack up in the field. I don’t know how much you follow nascar but Daytona is a draft dependent track it’s not the 90s anymore where you can separate from the field, it’s going to be a condensed pack especially for the first couple laps until people either calm down or take each other out. I typically go for the lead and put the car up front since I race open setup races I just like to confirm to myself that I have a car capable of taking the lead but for someone just starting out or just in general I think patience is key. Don’t hangout in the back of the pack or back of the midpack try to stay at like the end of the lead pack but just enough to where you can stay with the draft. There’s going to be lots of wrecks people are going to make mistakes even lose their temper if it’s one of those situations, point is if you can find someone you feel is dependable to work with who can take pushes or give good pushes try to stick with them but don’t get yourself wrecked doing so. You’re pretty much just riding around trying to stay in the main draft until the end where things get even more wild. It is a full length race and iRacing doesn’t even have stages so it’s like 2016 on back where stages didn’t exist in real life so it’s a full 500 miles or more if there’s green white checkered/ overtime restarts. The rest of the schedule will have races half the length of the real deal so pretty much just full length real life xfinity races besides a few more full length cup races such as the Brickyard 400, Coke 600, and Bristol 500. I know it’s easier said than done but just avoid the wrecks the best you can sometimes you get caught up in it but if you can get back out there and not be too many laps down or too far off the pace I’ve seen guys still salvage a top 20. Nothing special but at least you can finish it if you get involved in someone’s mess. Best of luck out there."
"It's the Next-Gen car. 

I'd say start in the back. The race is 200 laps so survival is key. Have patience. 

There will be cautions so avoid the crashes and stay on or near the lead lap since the lucky dog is in effect - 1st car a lap down gets back on the lead lap.

 It's a long race (like 4 hours) so make sure you have water or snacks nearby during cautions.

Blocking is still technically banned per the sporting code, but it is very likely you'll see blocking late in the race by the leader. It's a normal thing in oval racing especially at plate/drafting tracks.

In oval racing, any overlap with another car entitles the car to space. Listen to your spotter.

Have fun!"
I did it a couple of years ago. Not a nascar guy but it's alot of fun on iracing.  Get vocal on the mic and try to form an alliance with the cars around you. You can't win it on your own and you need to. Be with the pack and try and get an idea of when people plan to pit. Try and pit as part of a group if your on your own you will end up slow. Most of all try and enjoy it it's a long ride.
Try to find someone before the race you can work with. Sometimes I message someone starting near me in the back if they are just going to chill and hang. If they say yes you can work with them.
Are there license restrictions for this kind of event?
Its camry time 😎
"190laps surviving

"A lot of good stuff here thanks, good luck to you out there too"
"Sweet, thanks

And I was probably gonna try quali but id likely end up midpack regardless. 

But yeah I mainly wanted to do it for experience, I dont expect a stellar finish without a lot of people wrecking out and giving me a fair bit of luck 😂

Well see how it goes and good luck out there!"
I believe it’s a C license for this one but I could be wrong
"D 4.00

Meaning either C license or a D license with a 4.00+ SR"
*camrys all over the place*
That's my exact game plan for every plate race...lol
Do not start and hang around the back. You're more likely to get caught up in a wreck or get disconnected from the lead pack. You want to be the last car in line in the pack closest to the front.
Yeah you should qualify. I never trust the people that wanna hang out at the back. And you'll not learn how the field is really racing
"Its all been camrys? 

*it always has been*"
"Also, the GTP battery deploy in iRacing is not accurate to how the real cars’ system works. It’s not supposed to be a power boost, so that leads to pace that the real cars can’t match."
well seat time. physics. potentially tire differences and track differences. temp differences. qualy times also seemed a lot closer in gtd and gtp at least
"There are a million different parameters that determine a car’s performance. IRacing tries to replicate many of them, and each one is just slightly off. That adds up to the difference you see.

Also, are you sure the weather conditions you’re comparing times from are the same in the sim and in real life? Track temp, air temp, and humidity make a big difference."
It’s okay to admit the simulation isn’t perfect (just not around certain people) and I believe a lot of the top split guys were going well beyond the white line on the entry into turn one along with having an unreal amount of track time to build a setup that the sim likes. I’ve talked to some guys who worked on some open wheel cars and GTP and they said there are certain changes that you’d never make IRL that you would on iRacing to go quicker
It’s like that on every tracks. Cars in iRacing are somewhat faster than their IRL counterparts.
In general the imsa cars on iracing have faster apex speeds due to more grip. My feeling is that it’s an accommodation thing
iRacing has more lateral grip than real life. Cornering speeds are higher.
Some parameters must be wrong on the sim.
We aren't gonna die if we overdrive it into the corner.
"Lots of reasons already brought up by others already. All I can say is that ultimately it is videogame. It will never be 100% accurate. And that goes for all racing simulators, regardless of marketing claims."
"The tyre model in iRacing isn’t perfect, it has slightly more grip and slip angle than in real life"
"GT3 BOP is unique to iRacing. The LMP2 class is not subject to any BOP as it's a one-make in iRacing. GTP is just teething issues because it's new fancy tech cars meeting 2008 racing sim. 

Tyre grip and downforce can also get busted on iRacing allowing you to carry far more speed than you should be able to through turns. Supposedly this is really pronounced when you take nascar next gens on road courses."
"Another factor to what others have said is tyres 
Imsa limit tyre sets 
Iracing didn't and I know my team in LMP2 was just throwing tyres at the car as there was no tome loss in the pits"
"The cars irl have to actually last. If the drivers drove the cars irl like we do in sim they’d last like 2 hours before they were dead on the side of the road. 

Tires actually matter irl. No pushing lap after lap if you want to actually have tires left, especially with limited sets where you can’t just change every stop

The human factor. Why push super hard all race which leads to fatigue and raises the chance of an accident? Something we’re less susceptible to in the sim because we won’t get hurt if we crash"
They're bad drivers. Any 0.8k iRacing driver could have won the race. 
Ask Daniel Morad.
"Cause iRacing drivers are better drivers than IRL drivers, duh"
"i think overall physics of iracing are... at best questionnable (grip, aero, power, bop, tyres model etc..) and leads to just better performance. On top of that you can add the fact that there is no financial or logistical limit to train on sims. And last there is no ""fear"" to crash.

Finaly, the traffic. seams like a lot more traffic to managed irl than on iracing average daytona sprint/endu. (because half of the field is in the bin after 10 laps usually)

&#x200B;

On the other side, i found it very disturbing that cars goes THAT MUCH slower irl.

The cars looked horrible to drive especially GTPs"
One is a game and one is real life. You also don't have to worry about injury.
Variable track temps and humidity compared to a primarily fixed temp. Also race pace is usually a touch slower in general.
Always has been
Iracing is a game. Real life isn't. It's weird you would expect them to be the same.
"If I fuck up on iRacing, I hit reset and get a new car.

If I fuck up in the real car, it has to have repairs that take hours, and the owner shows up asking me for a check to fix the damage.

Also, if I fuck up in the real car, it'll hurt.  A lot."
Probably because of BOP and also they don't drive the cars all out. They were even talking about how they don't use all the power available to them during the race. They are often going a bit easy or fuel saving.
"Real cars are less predictable than something thats created on a computer.

You can guarantee that everytime you hop on the sim with the same conditions on track your car is gonna feel the same, in real life there’s no way that’s the case, there are way too many parts that go into a car and environmental variables."
"One additional thing I haven't seen mentioned (that also only applies to GTP): iRacing is modeling the hybrid system under different rules than the real cars.


The real cars have a maximum power output at any given time that is a combined limit for both ICE and hybrid.


iRacing is modeling a more traditional hybrid system, where the hybrid is added on top of the ICE power.


Doesn't make an enormous impact on laptime though.


Edit: oh, I see it has in fact been mentioned"
"the real reason is because if they slowed down the gtp's in iracing, then theyd have to nerf the lmp2.  which would probably lead to a nerf of lmp3 so the two dont get closer in speed.  which would make the p3 even closer to gt4 speeds which makes the speed differential in pilot challenge in iracing even worse than it is now

not to mention irl they have to double stint tires for a lot of the event"
"All those things in the comments before this one. And another very important thing, iRacing is a GAME after all."
Why do you think iRacing is so inaccurate in that regard? I think the hybrid mostly maintains peak power on the real car if I recall correctly.
And even with that the iRacing cars are slower in a straight line than IRL. They just have far too much grip in the sim.
"Solid list. I’d add the real life risk factors as well, such as crashing into an actual wall or getting punted into outer space. We can push the limits in a simulator because there is no fear. Harder to get to that absolute limit in a real car. And to see how close real pros are to the fastest sim times in every category/series of racing I think is truly a testament to their skills and bravery. "
"Seat time I don't buy. A pro driver can get within a few tenths in under 30 minutes, so that shouldn't be it.


And temp differences shouldn't be enough to account for it either, since even at maximum temps, mortals on iRacing can beat a real life qualifying time from excellent conditions.


It really comes down to the tire model. iRacing's tire model has come a long way, but it still has way too much lateral grip at the limit. (And that grip drops a bit too fast when you go off line or get some slip, but that's another issue).


It's beyond what can be passed off as ""they're modeling a different tire"", unless they're modeling a full-blown tire war series like Super GT. But why would they be modeling an outlier like that (and we have tire warmers on GT3, so we're clearly not modeling SGT anyway).


Now, don't get me wrong. I enjoy the racing we get on the current model. Though as mentioned above, the loss from taking an alternate line shape is a bit too much, which does make some things lines used in traffic IRL less viable in sim -- like a prototype going around the outside of a GT in the horseshoes. But overall, the racing is very satisfying currently."
No way! The truth is simracers are 5 seconds quicker!
"Yeah, the extremely generous T1 track limit is worth half a second or more by itself."
"One factor I never see mentioned, these are currently-raced prototypes in active competition with each other. There is *a ton* of sensitive and proprietary performance information that either isn’t being passed on to iRacing, and/or iRacing is obligated not to include in the sim.   

Hell, the BMW LMDh was released on iRacing before it had even completed a single race lap, there’s no way the sim performance could match real world, and there’s no way BMW would let a sim accurately showcase the cars performance to the competition before the season even starts. 

 All that said, this is still the best we’re likely to get from any platform, but I take these bleeding edge, currently-racing prototypes that are in iRacing with a *huge* grain of salt. "
[deleted]
This. I think the tire model has less rolling resistance than irl
I don’t think Kevin Estre thinks he can die
Simulators at least go for the 24 hours though.
LOL yeah the Next Gen car was like 7 seconds faster at Road America in iRacing than the real cars. Tire/grip model is completely wrong.
"That doesn’t account for FIVE SECONDS of lap time difference, lol. Also, if it was just about preservation then why wouldn’t the lap times dramatically lower at the very end with 10 minutes to go? It’s very clear that there are huge discrepancies in the Daytona‘s level of grip as compared to real life, it’s that simple."
"> The cars irl have to actually last. If the drivers drove the cars irl like we do in sim they’d last like 2 hours before they were dead on the side of the road. 

I agree with your comment except this. Outside of things like bumping other cars or slamming the kerbs, these guys are flat out all the time too."
"iRacing physics are the best on the market, fuck are you on about? "
"Haha, you‘re getting downvoted"
"Downvote! WTF, iRacing is a game? What’s wrong with you, mate? Looking for trouble, huh? You can come get some!"
"Real life is a game that is trying to stimulate iracing. That is why they are a bit slower. But hey, they are slowly getting there!"
Iirc teams can write their own algorithms for hybrid behaviour.
"The irl LHDM and LMH hybrid system is used alongside the ICE to make a combined 500kw of power.
The 500kw can come all from the ICE or it can make 450kw and the hybrid makes up the other 50kw.
In iracing you get the 500kw of power from the ice and then the 50kw from the hybrid on top giving 550kw total so the iracing cars accelerate a bit quicker"
"Because iRacing used the deployment system from the Mercedes W12/W13 for the GTPs. They have the same prototype deployment for both classes, which leads to inaccuracies for the prototypes."
"Professional racing drivers driving top flight prototypes are not leaving seconds on the table because they’re afraid of crashing

It’s ok to admit iRacing isn’t a perfect 1:1 simulation of reality…"
"i mean we can easily get so much more seat time than is irl possible in the sim. i'm not saying all these factors alone account for the difference. i'm saying all these factors together account for it.

yeah sure temp might not do that much alone. but it does a bit. and if everything does a bit it adds up. yeah tire model might be the biggest. 

&#x200B;

qualy times. especially in gtd were surprisingly close. even top split p1 was ""only"" 0.8 secs quicker than the irl gtd pole. was it faster yeah. were quite a few teams faster than the irl pole time of 1:44.3 yeah sure. but a majority was slower than that time.

thought also one thing is that irl they run an open qualy so draft is a thing. but i think the pole lap didn't really have that much draft"
Must be why Max Verstappen is so fast compared to everyone else. I imagine he’ll do part time as a soccer player too with how much fifa he plays
"Those are amazing points actually, awesome!"
This implies that professionals are not driving at the limit because they do not have as much practice as sim racers. I cannot agree with this. Professionals are professionals because they do drive at the limit.
"That’s silly for multiple reasons. The biggest one is the time differences between iracing and the real life event are FIVE SECONDS A LAP.

Beyond that, the diminishing returns of extra practice could never possibly lead to whole SECONDS of time being found. Also, with 10 GTPs running for 24 hours straight, you’re telling me at NO point did anyone push as close to the limit as possible for even a single lap? 

You guys are delusional if you don’t think 10 minutes to go at the end of a 24 hour event with a battle for position, these guys aren’t absolutely maximizing every bit of performance the car has. We had 262 drivers running in this years Rolex 24, some of those guys have turned thousands of laps there. If your theory was correct, you’d at least see the rare lap time that was significantly faster, but you don’t, across the board everyone ran consistent lap times throughout, including at the very end.

There is more grip on iRacing than in real life, it’s that simple. Even as compared to other sims iracing. usually has higher corner speeds."
Yea there's iRacers with more seat time in one track then a professional might have over their entire career.
"*The cars* are probably modelled accurately in terms of weight and power and so on, but the tires, aero, and track surfaces are at best crude approximations of reality."
"It's not a straight-line problem, so I'm not sure I agree."
Thats because he *cant* die. 🫡
Yeah thats the car/track combo that pointed it out the most. They were pushing on real GT3 times instead of real nascar times
"They are not in the slightest. They have tire and fuel management, as well as brake management and overall just self preservation. They are not even close to flat out all the time, hence why they were running 3-4 seconds a lap slower in the race than qualifying"
Reddit is just a stupid hivemind half the time.
"
*
I guess you have trouble with iracing itself then. They call it a game on their website."
"The irl drivers are not changing any deployment modes because the rules limit the output to a certain kw, correct? 

Really, there should be no interface with the battery in the game other than turning it on and off if I’m not mistaken."
"This isn't actually true for IMSA. The engine's are limited to 670bhp, but combined the system can produce up to a limit of 700bhp. So while the deployment will work mainly in unison with the engine to maintain peak output, it does also allow them to go over the deployment available solely available on engine power alone."
It's a fairly well established reason for sims being marginally faster.
"Funny, the pros I've talked to say the qualification lap and the final lap are the only. 10/10 drive they do. The rest isn't full beans (at least not on purpose)."
Absolutely. It's always jarring to switch between other sims and iRacing
[removed]
">fuel management

Unlike iRacing, they have usable fuel maps. 

>brake management

Doubt it, they can swap those

>tires

Fair

>They are not even close to flat out all the time, hence why they were running 3-4 seconds a lap slower in the race than qualifying

Traffic? Fuel load? Aforementioned tire management? Either way, given the conditions they have they're still looking to pull out the maximum."
Half the time?
Yes that is true but irl when the battery deploys the ICE power output drops as to not go over the power limit (which is what the 6 got penalised for during the 24) in iracing the ICE power output doesn't drop so whilst the battery is deployed on iracing the GTPs make more power then the real cars
The reason is that in the sim you can set the car up on a knife edge because our simulation of the track surface is very limited. IRL you have to leave a bit of margin to account for variables we don't have.
"At the end of a 24 Hour race these guys are not leaving any time on the table. Watch the Indy 500 if you really think professional racing drivers aren’t willing to potentially die into every corner. Bourdais qualifying wreck is indicative enough, that is not why the times were FIVE SECONDS slower."
For amateurs. Professionals are not driving below the limits of grip. They drive at the limit.
Pros crash about the same amount IRL as in the sim.
"Its not though, how is it established? Racing in rl, the last thing you want to do is have your competition build an opinion on you that you are a “safe” driver. Competition is amplified, if you are thinking about wrecking, guarantee you are finishing back of the field"
"This isn't even a dig at iRacing, they can only do as much as they can. For the Daytona 24 they're at the mercy of how much data GM or Porsche etc is willing to share with them. The Formula A Merc W13 certainly will be very different from what Lewis Hamilton drives both in real life and Mercedes F1's team simulator. All of these cars on IR have some element of guesswork to them, the more high profile cars will be worse in this regard.

But as for the time gap being what it is, it just simply isn't explained by fear of crashing, injury, or even death. There will always be drivers who don't give a shit about it and will push to find the time. It's same as those who climb mountains without rope, or go skydiving without parachutes.... some people are just wired differently.

Unfortunately IRL motorsport has long had a history of people who've died in pursuit of the final tenth."
"Like... a tenth per lap maybe. As you said, *marginally*. I could run within 2-3 tenths of my full pace at Daytona and eliminate essentially all the risk of crashing. A pro is probably giving up less than a tenth to be completely safe."
"That does not net 5 seconds of pace. Do you realize how much 5 seconds is? That’s the difference between LMDH and LMP2. 

They can’t take those lines in real life because the cars in real life don’t have that level of grip at Daytona. The cars have more grip on the sim and that’s why they’re 5 seconds faster in sim. There is no world where anyone can convince me the pros are five seconds off of the pace due to safety concerns. Someone at some point would drive the car on the limit.

Your theory holds zero water simply due to the length and amount of participants in the race. Of 262 drivers across 60 cars for 24 hours, if your theory was correct, at some point SOMEONE would push the car to its theoretical limit. If everyone was holding back, that time would be excessively faster than other cars in its class, but that’s never the case. Every year the fastest times between a class of car are relatively close.

It’s mathematically impossible for it to be anything other than they are pushing flat out, and their cars have less grip than they do on iracing.

The safety argument holds even less water if you watch them race each other. Even with 22 hours to go, drivers were racing each other so hard as to cause wrecks, you’re telling me they’re willing to hit other cars but not push the car into a braking zone?"
This also has to do with tire marbles and offline grip. iRacing isn't nearly as punishing for picking up marbles as real life is.
"fuel maps still means conserving energy and therefor going slower? Brakes can and usually are changed once, but to make a setblast 12hrs at leastnyou can't constantly be hammering them to safely make it through, and an additional change will cost you a lot of time again.

- obviously they're looking to extract the maximum each lap, given a fuel target, keeping the tyres alive for a double, conserving and saving the caf and your own energy for the last few hours. Add onto that various inaccuracies in the physics, 3-4 seconds isn't a huge surprise. Also consider, IRL traffic is more plenty and usually more spread out, the whole GT field in iRacing is usually quite tightly packed, and the number of teams that wreck and effectively retire wirhin an hour online is bigger, I mean, 10-15 cars out early hugely 'speeds up' the race"
To add further I remember a driver also mentioned that the way you can attack kerbs over and over in Iracing isn't quite the same as you can do at the actual Daytona. I don't remember what driver said this but however.
"They are 100% leaving some time on the table. It's not about the potential to die, as y'all like to make this assumption to be about.

It's money.

If you wreck too many cars, if you're wasting money on crashes, and stuff like that, then you're not gonna have a ride.

So while they might not fear death, they do fear *not having a job anymore.*

Like, that's pretty basic stuff. Hell, I even did this in sim today. Went ""hm. Well, right now it's pretty sketch but I'm in a really good spot, i'll just drive around in 4th and try to keep this position rather than accidentally spin the car"".

Absolutely something you can run into. Because a lot of the setups we run? We absolutely would not IRL. It's okay to realize that people are human and not some super human. \[There's also the fact that tires can spontaneously combust, certain configurations might be less than possible in real life due to manufacturing issues, and, well, manufacturing issues. Simulators build the ""perfect"" version of every car. Much like how we should get certain performance out of our CPUs and GPUs on paper, it doesn't mean we always do.

So, that's the simple version of it all. There might also be some slight variation in iRacing based on simplication of maths (to make sure it's ""optimized"", as y'all like to use incorrectly), slightly incorrect values, or, just subtle differences in what we're provided that the manufactures gave iRacing vs what's in the real life cars.

There's so many things that go into why iRacing could be faster. To straight up ignore that *they have a job and need to make sure they and their team continue to get money* is just absolutely silly. It's certainly not the ONLY reason. But it absolutely does impact it slightly."
"Dismissing the factor entirely is still a bit much.

Self-preservation is a natural inclination, and will have an effect on measurement, no matter if it's small. Also doesn't diminish other factors simply by being A factor."
"Yeah but the limit is lower on real-life tracks which have much more variability in track surface, tire wear, etc."
"I'm shocked that so many people seem really bothered by this comment, especially it including the MARGINAL part.

The only issue I've ever had was people dismissing the factor entirely, when it is IN FACT, a factor, even if......marginal.

But, apparently I hold a bunch of other opinions I've never once stated. 🤷‍♂️

I assumed a place like this would hold people that understand time adds up based on a myriad of factors, large and small, but I guess pissing contests about how accurate it REALLLY is are more important. 🙃"
"If you watched the race this weekend, the drivers on track were probably a foot to a foot and a half inside of where drivers tend to hit on the sim. That's a big difference in time."
"The reason this is even a thread is because there is 5 seconds of lap time difference between the fastest cars on iRacing and the fastest cars in real life. 

I'm not saying there is no difference between self-preservation in real life vs a sim, but that doesn't even account for 10% of the FIVE SECONDS.

It's a bad faith argument to not acknowledge how significant of a delta 5 seconds is. That's literally the difference between LMDH and LMP2. These guys are not slowing down a whole class difference due to self preservation. 

If what your saying is true, you'd see a much higher variance in lap time of average lap vs best lap. At SOME POINT in a 24 hour race, one of the 60 cars and 262 drivers would drive a lap that is close to the absolute limit, right? If your theory was correct about how much drivers are holding back in real life, you'd see a huge discrepancy between best times and average times, but you don't. At a minimum you'd see a higher variance in lap times between cars and drivers, those with more risk tolerance having significantly faster times, but again, you do not see that. 

You'd have to lack critical thinking or just be straight up delusional to think that the vast, vast majority of time difference between iRacing and real life is self-preservation and not wanting to crash the car. That's nearly mathematically impossible just due to the sheer amount of laps turned across all entries.

It's obvious that Daytona just has too much grip on iRacing as compared to real life, being all the classes are about the same amount slower in real life as compared to the sim."
"When the question is “why are the times slower irl” we’re talking about the 5 second difference. I’ll give you a few tenths per lap, sure, but it’s silly to act like THATS where the difference is. It’s clearly the Daytona grip levels being too high compared to irl and the GTPs hybrid on iracing isn’t accurately modeled. That’s the extra 4.8 seconds, I’ll give you 2 tenths.

Also I’m not dismissing it, I specifically said “fastest lap times”. The fastest lap in 24 hours is going to be one on the absolute limit. I agree that you’re not doing that every lap, but if we compare the outright fastest times on iracing vs real life, the self-preservation factor IS dismissed, because again, tens of thousands of laps were turned across all the cars, ONE of those has to be on the absolute limit.

I love iracing and I personally don’t give a shit how close it is to reality. I just love racing. It doesn’t bother me to see the times being different, especially when the entire hybrid system on the car isn’t even modeled correctly and that’s known. It seems like people in this thread are grasping at the only explanation that could explain how iracing is still 1:1, just so it doesn’t make them feel bad, I guess? It doesn’t matter if iracing isn’t 1;1, the racing is real on the sim. No one here can actually argue the 5 second difference is due to self-preservation, not in good faith at least. It would take sheer delusion to believe that. Basic critical thinking and simple math functionally proves otherwise. If you asked Nasr or Delatraz how much time they left on the table in those last laps they’d laugh at anyone in this thread who claims the iracing times are realistic."
"You clearly haven’t done it before, or was not successful doing it"
most pros think about crashing approximately 0% of the time and thus it doesn't affect their lap times. It's being dismissed because it's not a factor. as soon as it becomes a factor is when they lose their ride cause it then CAN become a factor.
"It's simple: iRacing has too much lateral grip. That's true in every road class, at the least.

Last year, for Grand Prix Tour races, it was common for pole times in the broadcast split to be faster than the pole time for RL grands prix at the same track. And that's racing the Merc W13, a car that was a year out of date and not nearly as fast as last year's Ferrari or RB19.

And while the top split drivers are good, they are not as good as Charles LeClerc or Max Verstappen over a single lap. Not even when self preservation is taken into account. Race pace was still a little too fast, too, but single lap times are just too fast all around. 

Which is fine. I really like the current tire model. It just has some flaws."
"I agree that the limit is lower. But it's because there is less lateral grip, partly due to the reasons you've mentioned. Not due to fear."
"Probably because you were responding to someone talking about seconds, who was responding to someone who didn't specify an amount.

It's just barely a noteworthy part of this subject. So when you respond to someone saying such, appearing to disagree, of course people are going to respond."
"That's an awfully long reply for something I never claimed as an absolute, mentioned as ""marginal,"" and that... within the aforementioned context.. you agree with. 👍

It's very odd when people build out an entire argument to rally against, that was never argued, because others within the room are arguing it... apparently."

"I personally only do one race a day. If I do well, great, if I don't, I will try again the next day. If I still have time after a race, I will just drive something else, just turning laps in practice sessions or even race against ai.

"Remember it's only a 'game'. Sim I mean sim, come on guys."
"I just looking different on crashes.
For example, I love F4 and in Tsukuba lose 400 iR in one day. I have different crashes, mostly I avoid 1st lap crashes but in the other laps someone locks up his tires and hits me, I am not always enough quick on reaction and do not turn out from a car behind that flies into me on locked tires.

So, pitstop for quick repair and go racing.

Oh even was such a great wreck in the last corner, a few cars were standing on the last corner because they were wrecked, the frontman went left, I little bit slowdown, went right near Pitwall, go full throttle when passed the wrecked cars and that man, who goes left, he loose control on grass and full speed go into side of my car.

Anytime when I am wrecked by someone's mistake I just think ""What an amazing wrack! Let's look and replay and maybe it was available. Move on to the next race"". If it's my mistake I will say sorry and look into replay for learning. For reference, I have a B license without cheating. I bounced between A and B.

But yeah, I have only 11 wins and 190 top 5 on 1000 races. I take racing seriously (rules, leaving space, for me it's not just a game) but maybe I'm easy to not be upset because I do not go into a race without hopes or the mood ""I must win"", rather I go with the ""Let's do some racing with others"".

Maybe if you will be less think about your finish position and more about moments in the race you will be less upset."
"one thing that a lot of people say helps them to stay positive is being more appreciative of slightly higher positions. for example, instead of always wanting a podium, just aim for a top 10. if you have to work for that top 10, you’ll be very happy with yourself when you get it, and if you find yourself getting it easily, move your target lower!

also try to set goals. do you want to gain iR or SR? do you want to place highly in a championship? do you want to have some intense and close racing? look at these goals, whichever yours may be, and try to understand what way of driving will suit this goal the best!

i recently decided to break free from C class and grind my ass off for B class by starting a bunch of races from the pits and making it my goal to get 0 incident points. and i did exactly this without even losing much iR! Now i’m a 4.4 B class driver and all i need to do is one more B class race and i’ll be A class! yeah, I haven’t done much competitive racing lately because of this, but I have enjoyed myself because I worked towards a goal and achieved it!"
Watching an IMSA race usually helps. You see that even the pros make mistakes and get unlucky breaks. Helps to have that perspective on how racing works.
You aren’t pro.  Your day to day life don’t change.    Stop caring. It’s a game. Have fun and welcome.
"Honestly had the same thing, got to like 16 within 2k rating and tilted down to 1600 crashing out every race , just have a mindset shift, race your race, don’t get caught up in the crap and crash out, don’t over drive trying to make up a place or keep up with the guy infront, if you’re not quick enough you’re not quick enough, but eventually you will get quicker if you keep practicing. Most importantly don’t worry about your rating, worry about driving the best you can and the rest will follow."
"Stop worrying about your ir so much and just focus on having fun. You don't have to get podium to have fun. Hell, yesterday I started a gt4 race in 14th and finished in 10th and I had an absolute blast battling a couple of guys"
"Hey man I feel you. I've been into sim racing for some years but just recently decided to get a VR headset and step into iRacing (before I was just randomly playing F1 23 or ACC/Assetto Corsa). Started very well with some races in rookies, upgraded to D class and had some serious frustrating experiences with the first few races (especially with MX5). Questions like: ""How the hell are they managing those lap times?"" ""Am I really that bad?"" 

In addition to that, there's the multiple crashes for a small mistake or someone's else bomb dive, etc.

To get over those issues I decided to do the following:

- Focus on practice (look at videos online for the best way/gear to approach corners etc). Most of the time I wasn't using the full surface of the track and I wasn't practicing enough. 

- If increasing iRating is one of your goals and don't have too much time on your hand, stick to 1-2 series (I currently mostly race the Ferrari 296 GT3, in my opinion much more sturdy and less slippery than the MX5)

- I focus on a clean race and clean driving. I might not end up top 5, but by having a clean race my safety rating is going to increase. At the end of the season (or even before) my license is going to increase and that's going to open up many more races which could be much more fun

- If the iRating increase/decrease is bothering you, consider some AI racing from time to time. You can still have a lot of fun without the ""goddamit I lost 80 iRating because someone crashed into me""

- Never forget to have fun. As much as this game is considered the pinnacle of Sim Racing and so many people are obsessed with it, it's still a videogame. It's supposed to give you joy and a way to escape life's issues for a brief moment.

  
I'm sure many other ppl will have some other tips and tricks, or even different views from mines. Nevertheless, I wish you the best in your iRacing journey. :)

"I opted to skip this week entirely. Between rental racing, I racing, and prepping bikes for the upcoming season. I don't have the mental capacity to learn a new track every single week. I think I'm going to switch to a bi weekly racing schedule for myself to save myself from burnout, gives me two weeks to learn a track with the limited seat time I have so I think it should work well."
"Try out a new discipline! Don’t forget that the iRating is 0 sum, which means everyone in a race gains iRating from other players. You should more so focus on safety rating to continue to the next

Try out some ovals for a week, get proficient and then go back to road. I’d bet that you’d learn a few things about car control and be able to translate some things to make you even better on the road racing side. If you wanna get crazy, get you on the dirt ovals. Those dirt street stocks are no joke and are a handful. Since I started 3 months ago I’ve focused mainly on ovals. I got a little tired of it and started to do more road stuff. My pace actually improved on the oval side and I was quite quick in the mx5 at Laguna Seca a couple weeks ago. 

TLDR; Race other cars in different disciplines. Ovals, dirt ovals, off road/rally cross. Remember that it’s supposed to be fun, so have fun!!!"

"1350 ir is not an average score. It is the number they grant all newcomers. Therefore, a person may have hundreds of races, and still have a rating less than 1350. Sometimes way less. I’ve hand my ass kicked by drivers with a score in the low hundreds. It’s almost a meaningless number. 
You need to set reasonable goals for yourself. First goal is to just finish a race without any off tracks. Next goal is to finish a race with no off tracks or incidents. Next goal is a top 10 finish. Next is top five finish. Look at iRacing as a long term learning opportunity, don’t be in a hurry to be at the top. This shit is hard."

"You've been doing this a month, some folks have been racing since they were karting at 5 years old so just be a bit more patient and it takes time but the effort is worth it.  Also race to have fun racing and to gain experience, not to worry about your IR number as that's how you burn out.  Drive clean, manage risk, turn off voice comms and relax.

At this point, start looking at some telemetry like VRS to analyze your laps and start to be more methodical about your race training.  If you aren't up to race pace in the higher splits then nothing else really matters so that is your next task.  You'll find which sections of track you're losing time and if you work those out in practice, you'll naturally move up the positions purely on pace.

I'd suggest not leaving MX5 till you were 2k+, it is worth the pain up and down to get to be a better driver with seat time.  Top split MX5 is extremely fun racing and very skillful.  Read 'Speed Secrets' and understand motorsports are an extremely high-skill ceiling sport."
"Don’t worry too much about your ratings. I use to worry too much about my safety rating and would race too conservatively and end up in a rut where I wasn’t getting faster or developing race craft

Your first 6 months to a year are all about learning. Being barely a month in and trying to be the best isn’t good for the mental health. Focus on having fun first and foremost. You won’t advance very far if you aren’t having fun.
"I've been racing maybe a week longer than you, last week I hit this. It was awful. Took a break until today. Although I would say I have been practicing Oulton Park (MX5) instead of official races since Monday. Jumped back in today and got the win in split 3. It helps to have a break I think :)

"Just like in real life be it sports, business, school, or on track…some days you’re the hydrant and some days you’re the dog. 

For me, when I have a bad moment in the car…whether it was a bad lap, bad race, or bad weekend…you want to have a short memory. Just know that every time you have a next chance…you get the opportunity to erase or learn and move on. For example…last year I had my first rain race ever. The whole day…just crummy rain, 45 degrees. Miserable. Had a morning practice session and then the race was in the afternoon. Started 7th in the race and fell back but slowly started finding speed. Just after half distance I passed for fourth place and figured I could just maintain. Spun at the next corner. Absolutely still pissed about it 9 months later. However, more than ready to get back in the car. 

So you can either attempt to forget a bad day….learn from a bad day…or use it to fuel your next day. You have to figure out what works best for you."

Watch your replays and see what's going wrong. Sometimes, you just feel like a magnet for incidents, and there's nothing you could have done. Just gotta keep racing and accept that they all can't be good.

 It's very common to do really well in rookies or just out of rookies. Then you bump up a few splits, and suddenly you're the slow guy. Just gotta keep racing. IRating is only there to place you in races that will be competitive for you. This usually means you'll be in the mid pack until maybe you win or podium a few times, and then you're a few splits higher, and you're the slow guy once again."
"Go pick a car you know you enjoy, on a track you really love, and just do some solo lapping for fun.  Don't chase lap times....just have fun.

Don't take it too seriously.   If you're not enjoying it, do something different."
"Mostly I start from the pits and try to focus on my driving. Main goal for me personally is a 0x race and if possible, a top 10 finish. I know it may not be for most driver, but for me it works.

And I drive a maximum of 2 races per day. If they are good, I'm happy. If not, well there is always a tomorrow."
"Open a bottle of wine, pour a glass and just enjoy yourself. Best technique i’ve found."
"Smoke more wees. But if you did it right before you started racing, you smoked enough to not have a rough day in the first place"
If I keep getting caught up in thing go into a few races with a goal of 0x. It's tough to get and the finishes will come as long as you focus on keeping YOURSELF out of trouble.
I wind down doing some oval racing or climbing the hill at Mt. Washington.
"The best advice I got from here, is to turn off the IR/SR overlay and just enjoy the racing

Aaaand the occasional lash out if someone take you dumbly :)))"
I run races until I have positive iR for the week. But I'm not smart and sometimes this takes a long time.
"All I see is times and crying. 😢 
  Listen hot shot 🔥 Racin ain't always about winning. Sometimes Its about losing. it's about years of learning and driving. As you rank up, hot shot , you're gunna come against hotter shots 🔥 
 And then the hottest shots 🔥. Be humble always. Hang in there man. It'll come around if you want it bad enough ❤️"

"Have a day, or more off. Bad days happen in everything in life. I am a HGV driver and sometimes I will do amazing reverses and manoeuvres, other days I am wonky as hell and wonder how I passed my test."
"IRating for me can be track & car specific 
Something I like comes up & I do a lot of races that week, next thing you know I am in the 1600s. New week new track, not much practice time because life is life. & I realize I am running 1200 times with a 1600 rating.
Eventually I’ll be <1200 & a good track comes up and I will have a shot at winning 
Embrace the suck, it pays off"

There’s a saying in RL racing you have more bad days at the track than good but the good days make it all worth it.

The above meme sums it up. You can probably replace 10K damage bill with - 400IR for sim purposes but you get the point.

I think we look at someone like Max and think that this what racing is meant to be like, just pounding win after win but in reality it’s a very frustrating sport."
"I like to keep it n mind the real life aspect. As frustrating as it is, it's a simple reset button for us. Irl, it's tens or hundreds of thousands if someone wrecks you. Crashing, idiots, all kinds of crap are part of raving. That's the simulation part of it. The more you rave and the higher you get, GENERALLY the racers are more considerate and you'll have more fun."
"Don't go Ferrari. Try go to C class and then HPD, it's a hole different game. This series have good drivers, and the car is easy and fun to drive."
"Racing isn’t my only hobby.   Have other interests.  For me it’s my truck, guns/hunting and building legos with my son."
"One thing I've noticed is sometimes it just isn't your day/week for a variety of reasons. During the Silverstone week on F3 2 weeks back, the first few races I thought it was awesome, but I really struggled to find more pace, so I started pushing more and more, this was sending me too wide, too many off tracks, too many close calls and I found I was getting slower as the week went on. Tbh it just made me feel like shit.

The very next week I had one of the most successful weeks I've had, period. Even battling against 4k ir fellas who I had no right even hanging around (2.4k myself).

Whenever I start on a new track there is always 3 or sonspots that I think ""I'll never figure this out, I just dint get it"", and often this leads to extra focus and they become my strongest sectors. Sim racing is not about winning, it is about doing better than you thought you could do! Don't be disheartened by a few poor runs, no race is wasted, there is always a lesson that can be taken from an event, could be you need to be smoother, more cautious, later on brakes here, earlier there, turn sharper here, avoid that curb, attack that apex harder etc.

Take 5, regroup, hit em harder next time"
"""yolo"""
"I’m in a pretty good league, i always can look forward to fun/clean racing in there atleast once a week"
I remember its a video game and that none of this matters and return to a state of calmness
One month in you have so so much to learn and so much room to improve.  It's taken me a year to get the basics like trail braking to be second nature and I have a lot still to learn before I can even begin to master techniques.
Dont race for 2-3 days or do a different discipline entirely.
"I’ll go do a track and car combo i haven’t done in test drive and just cool of in there. Learning a new car or track can help put your focus on something different. 

Either that or take a break for a day or however long you feel like and come back after to give it another try"
"Sounds like you need a coach. If you are podium hungry, consider an hourly coaching session."
Unrated Superspeedway - see if you can survive the crazies
"As some were saying, just focus on having fun right now. You're early in your iracing career. Just have good battles and finish races. You'll go up in IR and safety every time.

I've been playing for years and I miss my early days so much. If you're finishing races, you don't need to worry about pace until you're in the 2k range. Even then, not a ton."
"If it gets ruff usually i spectate the different lines faster racers take it usually helps to understand if youre in the wrong gear or taking bad braking points and it can give you an idea of where you can improve and you can try to follow their line, it has helped me in order to shave off literal seconds when it has happened to me"
"Switch to dirt road for a few races. It's always a fun series for taking a break. 

I'm also new and I've found that I'm way off the pace on most new tracks. If it's a track I've already learned I can do pretty well so I always go into races at new tracks with the mindset of just finishing. Saying that yesterday was still rough for me lol"
"Cut down on the races. I only do one race a day 2-3 times a week.

It became a lot easier to process that a shit race was just a shit race, as opposed to having that feeling of having to do another to correct the previous and then if thats bad I best do anothing. It just snowballs."
"One of the best things iracing has done lately is de emphasizing the member website and user profiles (all bios where people used to brag about peak irating were removed a few months ago).

 I spend so little time now looking at other people's profiles and trying to compare my irating to theirs. I just log in and race without worrying about losing rating etc. It's so much more fun thay way when you stop caring about the numbers."
"I second this. This seriously works better than anything else I’ve tried. Sometimes taking a week off will shave an entire second off my lap times. It can be a bit infuriating after spending hours a night trying to shave off a tenth; but the faster pace sticks, and so far I haven’t had a session where I regressed. Part of it is just giving your brain enough sleep/time to consolidate and crystallize everything you’ve learned, and another part of it is giving yourself enough space between sessions to forget the bad habits you’ve picked up in your most recent races. Seriously, if you feel like you’ve hit a wall, take a break. You won’t regret it."
Wait. iRating is supposed to be 4 digits?
IRating is a horrible representation of your actual skill I stopped caring for that number years ago. Had oval 4k at one point just to realize I will never compete with the top spli guys on the nascar side my iRacing said they were my skill level. Had to fix that.
"When I start losing IR I just think fuck it, it’ll just make the competition easier"
"Win or lose, if i have awesome battles on track, i could care less what my ir is haha"
If your dad is rich enough you can do this IRL!
"Same here. One race a day, four or five days a week. Don’t get how people can sit and do race after race for hours upon hours lol"
This is a great way to look at it.
"Yeah I always aim for top 10.

I think trying to aim for a podium every race is just setting yourself up for disappointment. Too many variables are invloved for that, where top 10 feels always possible."
Which races are you getting clean racing from the pits?
"> 1350 ir is not an average score. It is the number they grant all newcomers. 

Maybe, but with a 1350 iR, in a series like FF1600 rookies, you get placed on the top 5 of the second split. And as someone who's there, I'm hopelessly outpaced by everyone.

And it's a shame, because I see everyone else having close and clean battles that look like a lot of fun, and I'm there, hanging at the bottom by myself.

Then my iRating goes down and I'm still a bit out of pace, but since I'm the only one that can keep the car on track, I get a podium or a win and I'm back at the top splits, where I absolutely don't belong.

It's kinda frustrating."
"Or just a different discipline in general, could be whatever you don't main. I wish the pro 2 lites had more participation though it's so fun."
"Stop flexing your 10k rating, cheers"
This is news to me too. My rating can barely qualify for a mortgage 😂
No I don’t know what these people are talking about. 999 is max iRating
"That’s the right attitude. The better you do the harder it gets, and soon you’ll be up against people that can spend their day practicing and fine tuning things, while you’re at work or spending time with family etc.

Just roll with whatever happens is my thinking on things, too. There’s no medals being handed out for an impressive iRating. Nobody gives a shit about anyone else’s. Race for fun. I tend to do better when I’m not paranoid over milking stats in games anyway."
So many people think IR is your score like you were playing a game and trying to beat a high score. IR is just iRacing's brutally honest way of trying to put you in a split where you have hope.
Great battle for 17th > cruising home in 3rd
"I'm the total opposite, I travel a lot for work so I can only hop on iRacing once every week or two. When I do have the time though, I'll go do 6-7 races in a row to get my seat time in."
"pcup and ferrari challenge! i literally just drove on my normal pace, gained a bunch of positions through people binning it and always made sure to brake as soon as an incident occured ahead"

"A dd wheel won't take a bad racer and turn them into a good racer. A good racer can be very good with a g29.

immersion wise though.... night and day different."
Yes but only if you prefer to feel like you're driving a car instead of gears and belts.
"I made pretty much this exact upgrade, from g920 to 8nm dd, and csl elite v2 pedals. 

1000% do it man, I've only raced mazdas so far, but I went from barely hanging on to the back of the pack in top split, to regularly challenging for poles and victories. In the 2 months I've had the dd, I've gone from 2k -> 5k irating. I never expected such a huge performance gain, and I wouldn't say that's typical, but for sure you will gain some time/consistency, no doubt about it. 

Don't sleep on upgrading the pedals, the loadcell brake really does make up a big chunk of the performance gains, and is huge for consistency, as long as you have a fairly rigid place to mount them. 

If you have any questions just ask, ill be sure to convince you that the upgrade is worth it haha"
"100% do it.  Don't skimp, and get the 8nm kit.  Trust, it is so much better benefit for really not much more than base 5nm."
If you haven’t upgraded the pedals from the G29 ones I would do that first. There’s much more payoff in car control and consistency than compared to a wheel upgrade. 
"Omg, it’s night and day."
I went with the Moza R5 bundle. Pedals kind of suck but they’re serviceable and their loadcells are less than 200$. It’s plenty enough feedback imo and i got it in 2 days on amazon compared to 2 weeks direct from Moza and only 20$ish more since Moza charges a lot for shipping.
Yes BUT look around the sim racing subs for all the Fanatec horror stories in the last 6 months. I wouldn’t touch them with a 10 foot pole at the moment
1000% worth it. Upgraded last week from a G29. I could never go back.
"Yes, 100% upgrading to a DD wheelbase with increase the immersion and fun factor. The power boost kit is a must, but if I’m honest and cost isn’t a thing for you, I’d advise just getting a higher end DD off the start. You’ll eventually want more power anyway. I came from a G29, then the CSL DD, now the DD2. If I could go back and do it again I’d go right for the SC2 Pro, but all the wheel options are quite intimidating at first which is why I stuck with Fanatec."
It's the difference between a children's toy and a grown-up one.  The problem is that it opens up upgrade possibilities that can become pricey.
Massive difference in feel but load cell brake made more difference to my times/consistency
"Don’t buy Fanatec. In the similar range I think you can find a Moza wheel. Many horror stories about Fanatec customer service and delayed shipments recently. 

In terms of performance, yes a DD can help you drive on the limit easier as a stronger wheel can “self correct” oversteer due to physics"
"This thread has convinced me to go ahead and pull the trigger on DD and load cell pedals. I’m newer to iRacing only a few weeks now, but have IRL racing experience - worked my way up to A Oval license with a few wins .. now I’m trying to get my iRacing to top splits.. and I can’t help but feel that this G923 is holding me back, really it’s the pedals more so than the wheel at this very moment. 

It’s a complete and total guessing game for me as to how much I’m braking because it feels like nothing. Unless I’m staring at the gas and brake telemetry meters… I genuinely have zero idea how much brake I’m using."
"Done this exact upgrade.   


You will have more fun.  x100  
Be sure to go full 8nm."
"Like others have said it doesn’t make you faster necessarily but I think the value comes in from getting all the detail and feedback that you wouldn’t get from the g29. I made the exact same switch and most importantly it made sim racing more fun for me, especially when I upgraded the power supply for 8nm. The g29 is great for figuring out if you even like doing this as a hobby but if you’re spending the money on iRacing you might as well upgrade. Do yourself a favor and get the boost pack and load cell pedal from the jump"
"I bought the logitech dd and it's much better for the consistency sake. I overdrive the car a lot and I spun quite often on the g29. I spun a lot less on the DD despite overdriving the car a lot more.

Personally I'm not a big fan of Fanatec in general. Also the logitech dd is 11nm and the price difference might not be a lot depending where you are."
"I made the exact same switch over 2 years ago, still use it to this day. I know you say cost isnt the issue so in knowing that I would recommend investing more on your pedals than a wheel. Direct drive is great but you'll find more of a difference on track with load cell brakes than you would with a new wheel."
100% a huge difference. But the biggest for me was getting a load cell pedal along with the wheel
"3 months in going from G920 to DD. I’ve gone from 1.5-1.7k to 2.3-2.5k so far. As with any new tool it takes time to adjust and use that tool to be better. Obviously it feels better, bumps, curbs, fib tension are all great, but as an example, today I got sideways in the pcup car and corrected and kept my foot in it and kept going. In the past I would have lost it. 

There are so many things to get correct-

Make sure your fov is correct/use the camera feature if you want to sit back further or closer, won’t effect fov 
Adjust the shift horizon line so it is at your eye level
Same with your monitors, they should be at eye level, not too high
Brake pressure- I was over braking, raised my pressure up from 45lbs to 60lbs, this gains me time and helps me turn better
Seating position, comfort is key, arms at about a 90 degree angle and knees should still be slightly bent even when accelerator is full depressed

I have found having buttons mapped and other things at any easy access, this helps with concentration. That’s all I can think of right now"
"My man very fair question, but it’s the load cell brake that will blow your mind away and results in most of the lap time from the G29’s pedals.

That said absolutely upgrade to the DD. IRacing will feel how it is supposed to and you’ll have much more feeling and control through DD over belts and gears."
"I recently upgraded to a CS DD from a G920 and the difference in mind boggling.

I’d honestly say that the load cell pedals made the biggest single difference, so you could get a decent set of pedals and connect via usb whilst continuing to use the current wheel, but if cost isn’t an issue upgrading both wheel and pedals is absolutely worth it imo.

I was winning races with my G920, but a better wheel and pedals really helps me feel out where the limits are to make it easier to find where to push to."
"I moved to a 8nm CSL DD a few years ago after running a G27 for like 6 years.  Im happy with it to put things lightly, and driving some twitchy cars is definitely easier with it, but if I'm being honest I mainly like it because it just feels like less of a toy, I'm still capable of putting in fast times with my G27"
The Direct Drive wheel will definitely feel better than the G29... but it's not going to magically transform you into Max Verstappen.
"I've never used the G29, but I drove with older Logitech & Thrustmaster wheels years ago. After upgrading to a Moza R9 & load cell pedal last year, it was like driving an actual car. Not only did my driving vastly improve, my desire to get back into sim racing increased as well. Btw, add a ButtKicker Pro or some shakers to your rig so you can feel the tiny bumps and grooves on the track."
"I made that exact switch, 100% happy with my decision best money I have ever spent!"
"Yes, it will help you feel and catch slides more easily.

Also, stay away from Fanatec, they're quite dysfunctional as a company right now, and there are many better products available."
Just get v3 pedals at the very least. Pedals will make you much faster than a wheel upgrade
Yes
"As your on pc do your research on alternative wells and bases.

Looking at another comment of yours don’t only look to buy off Amazon, Amazon quite often have a mark up for the convenience."
"It may help you catch your car faster when loosing the rear, and avoid the consequent spins and crashes, but I won't make you faster.

For that, you need to get rid of those G29 pedals and get some with a load cell brake pedal."
"On your ideal racing line on the track you know, it will not make much usable difference other than comfort and fun additional feelings like road texture.

On a new track, off the ideal racing line, when fighting for a position, on grass, in any scenario that you have to improvise, you are on another planet with DD."
"The pedals will mainly make an important improve. The DD wheel also will give you more information about road texture and quicker response to weight transfer. Short answer to your question is: Yes. But it will take some time to get use to the new equipment.

Also you could try buy Heuksinveld Sprints first, then upgrade the wheel. Fanatec pedals are Ok, but there are better pedals out there. Good luck on your purchase."
"I went from a t300 to a csl dd, people say it won’t make you a better driver and it won’t but it will definitely help with catching slides and I do think it helps with consistency but maybe it’s my imagination. Also the feel is 10x better so it’s definitely a worthwhile upgrade considering how cheap the csl dd is (relative to other products)

Another note: out of everything I’ve done upgrade wise, putting a monitor right infront of my face and buying the csl dd are both up there for me"
"Definitely agree with you, im not trying to become the next max or anything. But more for immersion(road feel and stuff) and consistency. 

im so used to driving with the thing i can’t wait to see the difference once i upgrade"
"I think it will make you more versatile though.

Before getting a DD I could not deal with oversteer very well, so I set up everything to be very stable, which is not the best for every car.

With a DD I can deal with a much wider range of car behaviours with confidence."
I know of a 7k driver on a T300
"Fun Fact, my wife has yelled to me ""IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE RACING! Took me a while to realize how quiet DD is. Years of gears, she got use to the whining sound."
"Hahahaha i will make sure to ask, reply appreciate how helpful and nice everyone is"
do you think the IR gain was strictly from the wheel base OR you committing to the sim and upgrading components thus being more committed and invested into racing well?
"i did that upgrade from the g29 with the load cell brake. worth it, so worth it"
Aren't bundles of DD and load cell pedals cheaper as well?  Probably the way to go if OP can find a good bundle deal.
Will look into that as well. Kinda sucks i dont see any Fanatec stuff on amazon
Was waiting to see someone say something about this thank you so much will look in to it and compare my options. Im in canada and usually amazon is my go to for all my sim racing stuff
"I got my CSL dd 8nm three ish weeks ago (From a three year old G29). Took me a couple of hours to get used to the force feedback and loadcell pedal. After i got more used to it, the whole expirience got better. I didnt get noticeable faster but i felt like I had a bit more confidence in the car."
"I just went from a G923 to a Moza R5 and I was absolutely blown away at the torque, response and feel. I’ve maybe improved a little bit because I can actually feel with more detail how the car is moving on the road. Next I want to upgrade my pedals to something with load cell."
"The pedals will have been more impactful than the wheelbase I expect. However sticking to one series, especially one which isn't say VRS which is hyper competitive, is a massive factor here.

I have a similar relationship with GRs I know I could easily gain 1k iR just racing that series and farming top split podiums where in GT3 I'm happy with a top 10@2600 SoF, I don't believe I'm a better driver in the GR it just isn't as competitive.

Still 5k iR is no joke no matter you slice it, I don't wish to undermine their achievement."
"It's hard to say, I still feel like I approached iracing as seriously before upgrading, still sticking to mazdas/using vrs for telemetry etc. 

I do think a lot came from the upgrade, although one thing at also contributed was a mindset shift. I used to want to attack/defend every position, which was great fun, but not smart racecraft. 

Now my aim is to minimise my total time to the flag. Sitting behind someone slightly slower, or letting the faster guys through without a lap long battle. Anytime there is a pack of cars a couple of seconds back, I'll be much more selective in who I choose to battle, to prevent the pack catching."
"They can be, however I'm sure more than one person has bought the Moza r5 bundle thinking the srp included with them has a load cell but it doesn't. I think Fanatec has the same thing with their entry level DD bundle where it's not quite clear the pedals aren't the same ones with a load cell."
"Fanatec only sells from its website, which has been full of problems lately. I'd recommend you going for a simagic or moza DD instead at the moment. (I'm a fanatec csl dd user) "
"Fanatec sells direct to consumer. 

They used to be king in the mid-range market but these days I would look at Moza and Sim magic. 

If you can find $200 more dollars the VRS DFP blows them all out of the water and for $300 more than that a simucube 2 would set you up until you give up the hobby."
"Unfortunately, if you’re in the US then Fanatec.com or a local second hand sale are your only options.  I made the exact same upgrade as you’re thinking and cannot look back now.  As has been said, night and day.  My league teammate and friend went Simagic Alpha mini and he swears by it too.  Fanatec is really losing shine in the community with their practices of late, so take your time and do your research.  The only thing you may regret is the money once you get sucked in!  If you stay Fanatec, go 8nm upgrade.  I had 5 for first 8 months or so then went 8 and wow… huge.  Also can’t stress a load cell brake enough either.  Another variable to adjust to, but so worth it.  Then look into a Buttkicker…. See, this hole goes deeper and deeper!  🤣"
"Yeah I'd agree with that, pedals were the number one needle mover for sure. Although it is helpful to have the wheelbase, especially I think in the mazda where you have to be super aggressively trailbraking. Getting more information about when the car is stepping out under brakes is definitely a huge help. 

And yeah I completely agree on the whole sticking to one series thing, my irating will plumet if I jump into a new series. 

It does seem like gt3 is the place to be if you want top tier competition, I want to work my way towards racing gt3's, but im in no rush/think I will find it hard to no longer be contesting for podiums/wins. But I need to get over my ego bc I'm sure the racing in gt3 is awesome!"
"Yeah, if I were in market now, I’d look Simagic or VRS"
"I know what you mean, I did a similar upgrade (Thrustmaster TX to Moza R12+CRP) and I feel like it has helped me be a better driver with better car control.

HOWEVER my iRating doesn't reflect ignoring my GR86 powered blip it's not moved really in 3 months, I believe I'm not giving it enough data as I race quite infrequently max 2 per week (1 sprint + 1 enduro, minimal practice). I know I'm a better driver though than I was though l, my car control and understanding is significantly better, but I have dabbled in riskier series here and there where I've given away iR and SR to have some fun.

Also the MX5 is harder than at least some of the GT3s I've driven so don't be too afraid! I'd recommend GT4 as a stepping stone but the value proposition is pretty poor and they've paywalled alot of the last couple seasons where GT3 with all the crossover between IMSA and VRS (and Ferrari Challenge if you go for the 296) has been relatively cheap!

Just choose your end goal and start building a path to it, GT3 is obviously popular but there are other options, can always go back to MX5 at any time. If you're willing to put in some time sleuthing the forums you can usually build a fairly cheap progression plan by identifying where premium tracks cross over while retaining MX5 as a bread and butter option because it never stops being fun."
"Yeah the lacking data sounds right tbh, comparatively I've done just over 200 races this season already 😅. 

That's interesting that you say the mx5 is harder to drive than some gt3s. So would you say, easier to drive, but stiffer competition? 

That's my concern, feel like the cost is going to get ridiculous, but yeah I will make sure to research/try to minimise cost, and maybe only buy gt4 tracks next season that will be able to be carried into gt3 when I eventually get there."
"Correct the MX5 and even moreso GR86 is quite easy to loop whereas it is still possible in GT3 it's not as nervous.

If I'm running into the odd real GT driver or streamer on quieter IMSA weeks you're for sure going to meet some stiff competition but imo it's awesome, I can say (and I'm quick to remind my lower iR friends...) I raced an irl Daytona 24 winner thanks to Daniel Morad picking up the W this weekend in GTD even though I didn't see him for long on track before I was a spec in his mirror...

There's ways to keep the cost in check, check the forums for the series you can race and start making a table of the schedules for relevant series, then you can plan a program which firstly gets you the license you need at minimal cost (e.g. buying a track which comes up in a C class event and then later a B class one). If you're leaning towards GT and/or endurance racing hit me up and I'll share my schedule as the season closes out as I prepare one for my team usually a week or 2 prior to the new season to help people plan practice etc."
"Must've been awesome to race Daniel, I've been watching some of his videos recently while trying to work out what rig to buy (still on a wheelstand rn). 

Am I right in thinking that somewhere there exists a pdf/info on all the possible tracks that a given series can use? And then the schedule for the next season is released a week or so prior to the start of that season? 

I'll definitely drop you a message nearer the time, appreciate it man :)"
"Correct but it's exhaustive so not too easy to interpret across just the few you want and comes out fairly close to the new season.

I go a step further a slink into the forums which usually have a post per series with the voting results before they're confirmed which let's us get a provisional calendar going before everything is official.

That means we can schedule for team races and our drivers can plan their spend accordingly to suit their schedule and budget and don't have to rush around when it goes official looking at what's coming when. We can also use the discounts for buying more things at once when we know everything we should need for a season! Just make sure not to spend any money until it is official as new tracks can throw the odd spanner in."
You either going to love it or (most likely) going to quit the car after 2 weeks of incredible inconsistent results because the car is all over the place. Also the lower splits are pretty dangerous and the top split are aliens.
"Do it, very rewarding car. Honestly I don’t think it is as hard to drive as some people say.
You will learn a lot about (trail)braking and throttle control, it will make you faster in other cars.

1.1k is no issue, especially during peak times there are plenty of splits."
"No ABS or TC. It's a tough go. If you enjoy that challenge, go for it!"
"Let’s put it this way: the Porsche Cup races are as much a battle with the car as they are a battle with your competitors. If you like that sort of thing, it’s great. 

In my experience, if you’re good in the Cup Car, you’re great in every other car. It’s one of the more difficult cars on the service to be *good* at."
"Try the LMP3! Clean racing and you can run both the LMP3 fixed, and the sports car challenge multi class as well. One runs at half past the odd hours, the other half past the evens. Both also run the same track schedule every week"
"Pretty discouraging series to run, in top split the field has like a 4 second difference between the leaders. Not a ton of close racing but it is satisfying to drive fast"
"Imagine driving the Porsche GT3, but with bicycle wheels fitted. The racing is usually fairly clean whenever I’ve done it though."
Gt3 Driver here. I learned a lot about the way i have to trail brake. Also you'll focus more on track elevation changes which affects your driving
"No TC, ABS, not alot of downforce... Hardest car to drive fast but the most rewarding car on the service in my opinion. All the skills you will learn from driving this car will translate to any car. Usually multiple splits each race. My favorite road series, definitely recommend if that sounds intriguing to you."
"The Pcup is hard to drive but very rewarding and you can learn a lot, the problem is it ain’t that very popular any more so you will end up in splits with people alot higher then you and just keeping losing more iRacing"
"Everyone here is saying to do it, but just want to offer the other perspective. I bought it based on the raving reviews, but honestly, the forced feedback on it sucks. I can never feel what the tires are doing, and everything requires so much more steering input than other cars. I hate it because I have to practice so much more with it than GT3 or LMP2. I work long hours and just don't have the time needed to get good with it. In my opinion, if you don't have a lot of time, I wouldn't recommend it and would say Gt4 gets you good racing with a much easier platform."
"its a difficult car, but rewarding when you learn it! like others said, you may find yourself in higher splits sometimes when participation is low, but if you catch the right time slot, you can end up in a more appropriate split quite often! the racing is also pretty good and stays close most of the time, so it helps with building your racecraft.

i think its absolutely worth giving a go! i think next week its at silverstone 2008 (legacy) which is a cheaper track than non legacy tracks, so that’ll be the best time to try it!"
"It’s a tough car to get ahold of. Feels like driving on ice. There are times where the car will just let go through a corner and often times it feels very unexpected with very little warning. You should also look at running the GT4 class in the Faulken Sports Car Challenge. Coming from the Ferrari GT3 challenge myself, I’ve been having a lot of fun driving the GT4 cars."
"When I first tried the Porsche Cup series it tool me a little while to adjust to the lack of ABS and TC, but otherwise its actually quite fun to race! You probably should get a decent amount of practice in though before joining an official race, the starts and T1 of pretty much any circuit can be a bit hectic

Get some practice, set a good quali time and you're halfway there"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/MoLPyRj4VH

Com here mate!"
"There's a reason why the highest level of competition on iRacing is in the pCup (PESC series; I know the endurance stuff is more prestigious but those races don't pay cash prizes).

I think you should do it. If you can learn how to drive the Porsche cup, it will make it so much easier to drive the other cars in the service.   GT4 cars feel like Miatas after driving the pCup."
"Go for GT4s first, then go to porsche cup."
Dodge the porsche you got to be to much on the edge and riding the brake pedal like it's the only thing holding you to the road.
Just don’t start next week. Silverstone legacy setup is really punishing on the rears. I’ve been grappling with it in practice and my consistency is way off
I think you’ll like the racing from 1.8k splits onwards
"What I love about the cup car is starting a week feeling so awkward and all over the place on a track I don't really know, to feeling the car hooked, having the rhythm and balance right all throughout a lap in a way that feels like a dance by the end of the week. Very rewarding experience "
"As someone who doesn't race too often it was a great training tool for my main GT3 endurance running but the racing itself is very inconsistent granted I always seemed to be driving tough circuits. At times it was the best battling I've had but more often than not something went wrong, often just being collecting in others mayhem (last one was someone doing a U turn onto the racing line after a spin, they even waited and saw us coming in top split no less)

The car feels very numb which meant I couldn't really read what it was doing especially when braking over bumps and crests e.g. VIR so it felt like I was driving more by memory than by feel which began to annoy me. I guess it was almost like a training exercise to drive with a handicap as I had to really think about what I was doing with the controls."
"I just started it yesterday and decided to prepare for silverstone.

It took me 8 laps to not miss turn 8 and completely cut through Club.

Fun car!"
This series will teach you how to turn the car using the break 👍🏻🙏
"I disagree, the car is extremely predictable once you get the hang of it.
Also there aren’t many real aliens in Porsche Cup, more often than not you can get a top10 in top split with 2-3k rating."
"That’s pretty good motivation honestly, thanks for the input"
"I’m a bit afraid of that to be honest, but I’m always up for a challenge!"
"Agree with that, first track you gonna drive porsche gt3 must definitely be a track you know very well, otherwise you gonna lose a lot and be frustrated with the results you get. You need to have grip on front tyres to turn the car"
I hadn’t thought of that! I do want to get into the lmp cars I just figured I’d start with the “slower” cars and work my way up. Maybe I’ll give it a shot
During European evenings it splits 4-7 times. Hardly unpopular imo. Even daytime has at least  2 splits most times.
I mean imola this week has been pretty good participation wise. I mean yeah there are times especially towards the start of the week with single splits. But a lot of at least two splits and also a lot of like 3-5 splits
"I’m not super worried about irating, mostly just want to learn. Good to know about the popularity though"
"It's very popular, the discord is always popping, and there are regional PESC championships going on all the time.  In addition to that, it's a very popular car for League races as well."
"The steering feel isn't great (I hear the real car is much worse) but if give it a lot more steering input than other cars, you are most likely bad on the brakes and understeering. With the PCup you need to be precise with the brakes, trail braking just the right amount to get front end grip. This is a car you really need to steer with your feet.

It doesn't necessarily have to take a lot of practice. Once you get it, it will just click and you'll be able to go fast."
"these are all fair points.  If you think it requires more steering wheel angle to get it to turn, you are not driving it properly. You really really need to run the rear wing low and trail break a ton to get the car to turn.  If you're just twisting the wheel, you are going to overheat the front and the problem will only get worse."
Things must have changed since the last time I drove it ( the old car). We had a bunch of 6k+ in the top split and lower split was carnage.
"Not disputing your claim, but where can I find the ""real aliens""? GT3?"
"It’s great training. ABS and TC can be helpful and leveraged well they can even be faster than not having ABS and TC. But overusing them or having them turned up too high is slow. 

Driving a car without them well enough to become competitive will make you faster in cars with those assists."
I was worried about the same thing but decided to try it out anyway last night to try and be a better driver. Did a few practice laps luckily I know imola pretty well. Decided to just go for it and do a race. Wasn’t fast by any means but didn’t spin or crash made a few over takes and after falling all the way to the back due to not realizing it was standing start had probably the most fun I’ve ever had sim racing. Cannot wait to keep working on that car.
Im new also and I would definitely recommend it. If you can give it a go to test drive it while there is a maintenance you could see if you like the handling. I find it’s very fun car and it’s very satisfying to drive. Though I must admit the lower splits are carnage sometimes
"In the pcup I can be within a second of the aliens no problem. GT3 I'm trash, can't keep up with people in my own irating. I hover between 1800 and 2200 irating usually. PCUP is much easier to drive in my opinion and teaches you good habits that crosses over to almost all road cars."
"I went from F4 to the LMP3 and Indy Pro 2000, its not a huge jump but the LMP is different to those and i adapted okay"
"I’m in SEA so maybe that’s why i struggle to get matched with people the same ir as me, even if there is 2 splits the chances of your split being anywhere near the 900-1500 mark are going to quite low, where as GT3 series the chances are alot higher, I don’t think I have ever been in a split in GT3 where any one in the field was more then 100ir then me"
"When people say it splits x times, they mean there are x splits per race right? Not total splits in a night?"
"If that’s the case then yeah go for it, it’s popular enough for the races to go official"
"Top split still has some aliens, but it’s not like it’s most of the field. Usually top 3-5"
"Man GT3 is a whole different beast. I was a 2.8k driver, consistently battling for wins in top split GT4. Had an amazing season in GT4 fixed, open, and IMPC. Moved to GT3 with high confidence and immediately got humbled by usually being in 2nd or 3rd split and battling to not be last lol. Those cars attract some crazy fast drivers"
"Maybe, but it depends on the driver. I started with PCUP and have had major difficulties moving to GT3’s the multiple times I’ve tried. I imagine I’m still faster than what I would’ve been without any GT work though."
"True, but GT3 is by far the most popular, don’t think it is fair to compare it to that. 
It could also have an advantage to have a lower rating and fewer splits, by keeping it clean you will beat a couple of higher rated guys and will increase your IR. Also the field is a bit more spread out which will make it less likely to get punted.

I have clean races in PCup in split 1 or 2 mostly, not sure how the lower splits are though."
"Yes, per race"
Yes I noticed this as well. It's very strange to see HUGE drops in qualifying pace between 1-5. Like 1s between each position sometimes.
So then yeah I guess I'll go to gt3 once I'm good at pcup lol
"Eh just move to it whenever you want to. GT3 is great because it’s so highly populated so you’ll always be in a competitive split. Compare this to GT4 or pcup where you won’t get many splits and plenty of times, you’ll only have one or two splits so for lower rated drivers, or drivers on the cusp of the split, it’s not competitive at all for them."
"Gr 86 is one of the best series on iracing, it’s an easy car to drive and has heaps of splits. GT4 isn’t too bad either if you plan on racing the multiclass series when you get to c class"
"I will always recommend Formula Vee. I'm A Class and still go back to it all the time, just because those nimble tiny cars teach you a lot. 
If you want something bigger I really like the GT4 cars and the different series they offer - at least at a C level. You have short GT4 only races (those are D Class), medium long GT4+LMP3 races and really nice 2h long GT4+TCR races every second week (Multiclass races are C class)."
"GR86 is the best to start. It’s free content and often has free tracks in the schedule. From there it depends what you see your progression being. If you want to end up racing GT3s eventually, then the GT4 is the obvious next step, especially with the multi class races at C license. TCR is amazing fun (my main series) but it’s quite specialised and doesn’t really lead on to anything, plus on less popular tracks participation can be very low."
"What you could also do is look at the schedules for d class series with free cars, and see if/when they are going to free tracks, to get your 4 MPR races, so you can get C License. This is the route i'm going because i'm already really close to fast tracking to C, and I love the fixed MX5s, alot more than the GR86. GR86 was pain at Charlotte Roval for me this week, GR86 goes to Oulton Park in a few weeks, which is a much better track imo."
I went from mx5 to gt4 and loved it. F4 is also a great category
"I recommend GR86/GT4 and then get to Porsche Cup.

If you are more into Multiclass and endurance then GT4 is a way to get into it💪

I raced GT4 and GR86 and now I started with Porsche Cup and I might stay there, it's fantastic car, not forgiving at all but you certainly feel the limit and it's very rewarding.

However GT4/3 cars are great as well, always many splits and competitive racing, cars are also easier to handle."
I went to gr86 as seemed to have a good amount of splits but I realized once there I had left mx5 too soon and I wasn't good at close racing at all. So back in Mazdas learning some race craft
"In my humble opinion, the GR86 felt poor, it’s soft and underpowered. It didn’t really give me any challenge or feel on the limit. For reference I am at 1.6k ir, and have the pace of the top 5 in ~1.8k splits. The GT4 is really fun, forgiving but hard to put on the limit. Also, the GT4 is much more value for your money imo."
I’ve been playing for almost a year and never realised they did these 2hour events! 😍 I race gt4 too. Thank you!
I didn’t like gr86 either: gt4 was way more fun
"I agree its not much challenge and probably too forgiving but it is a beginner car irl so it makes sense. I loved the gt4 open series until the lmp3 joined in.
I havent raced since the second season so it might have changed but they were just driving through me rather than trying to overtake safely"
"I personally went to a 49 ultra wide as vr is super sketchy atm with vajero and HP dropping support, WMR ceasing soon, pimax QC issues and big screen beyond being too new to gamble on it. The only good news in VR has been the quest 3. Check out gamer muscles videos, he has great reviews and guides."
"I'm not arguing with the guy above, everyone's experience is different, but I'm loving the Quest 3. It's true, Meta seems to not give the slightest shit about PCVR (and is possibly actively ignoring it), the Oculus software desperately needs an update (still no 120Hz option for the Q3 in the official software even though it's selectable in the headset, which is ridiculous), but there are solid workarounds for all these little things, including effectively getting rid of any noticeable compression over link cable.

I was running it via link cable until yesterday, which with a little research was hassle free, good quality and running well but limited to 90Hz, and you're left with the issue of keeping a decent charge while it's cabled to the PC. Today I bought a dedicated router for wireless PCVR via Virtual Desktop, and it's fantastic. Improved visuals, 120Hz and in my testing so far, it's performing flawlessly. There may be a touch of latency but it's nothing I can detect."
"Don't buy oculus. Link is a terrible experience and you will hate it going from real PCVR. 

There's also a good amount of evidence that Link only exists for developers of native headset VR experiences as certain features that should be exposed (eye tracking) are only enableable with a developer account.   They also break PCVR once or twice a year in ""stable"" builds. Issues that would have been caught if they spent 3 minutes in QA launching PCVR once. "
"I moved from G2 to Quest 3 with the elite strap and much prefer it, very comfortable and pancake lenses are a game changer.

The image isn't quite as clean as the G2 but I got used to the change after a day of use now I don't think about it.

 I use official link cable and lose charge while playing however unless doing something like an endurance race it shouldn't be an issue.

(After a 2-3 hours use in game I have like 70% battery left)"
"I went from a 49” Ultrawide to a Quest 3.  I love the VR experience and have had zero issues with the link cable or quality.  It is always a matter of personal preference, but the Quest 3 is perfectly fine."
So do I take it the quest 3 is better than the quest pro?
"Yeah I looked into going wide screen but don't have the space for one....hence the VR option. Personally I loved my G2 and would have bought another had they been continued hence the reason i'm looking at the Quest 3. 

I'll check out the videos you've recommended though thanks!"
"I’m running the link cable. I do have virtual desktop but bought it before I really understood it. I can’t run Ethernet directly to my PC, so am on Wi-Fi. VD probably wouldn’t work better than my link cable if I can’t run Ethernet directly to the pc right? No point in a dedicated router that connects to the PC if it connects to my main router via Wi-Fi? Thanks"
reddit moment 
"Yes, as per the great zuck himself in interviews."
"The quest 3 is similar but with edge to edge clarity so I’m sure you’ll like it, the only potential issue is the link cable connection rather than DP as it increases the latency to 30-40ms.
Not sure if that’s noticeable coming from the G2 but currently I’m getting around 5ms or less so I’m hesitant but its hard to beat the immersion of VR"
"I avoided ditching the link cable for some time for this exact reason -- I was unsure whether it was a waste of time and money going wireless if I couldn't cable my main router directly to my PC, which isn't a possibility in my current house. Read lots of posts suggesting it was a necessity. Then I read some conflicting posts from people who got everything running really well with a WiFi connection to the main router. So I bit the bullet, bought a dedicated router and set it up. Can confirm it works really well for me.

So my setup is: main house WiFi 6 router in another room connected wirelessly to my PC WiFi (so, my normal day to day internet connection). Then, my new 6E router (set up as an access point) connected via ethernet directly to my PC. The internet from the main house WiFi is then shared to the local 6E router via standard Windows ICS through ethernet.

My Q3 connects to the local 6E access point, and gets its internet via ICS from the PC WiFi. To be clear, the Q3 is the one and only thing connected wirelessly to this router. From my initial testing, average total latency in VR as reported by the VD overlay is around 30ms. Sometimes 26-28, sometimes mid 30s. Network latency is generally in the order of 3ms.

So the TLDR version is: in my experience, there is absolutely no requirement to have your main house router directly connected to your PC via ethernet for great results in VD on the Q3. The usual disclaimer is present, YMMV and others claim conflicting results, though that might simply be a setup issue in a lot of cases."
Oh yes. How awful. Actual experiences from users
It made a big difference to me going to G2. It became far easier to hit my marks and do consistent lap times. 
"Thank you so much for your write up. Annoyed that it might make sense to buy new stuff….. my router is not Wi-Fi 6 so I’d need to buy two…. 

And also spent so much tweaking everything to optimize the link cable a ton. The 120hz is really attractive though.

You’ve given me some stuff to think about!!!"
"he's not talking about the experience of using Oculus on iRacing at all, it's just a sweaty rant about the VR ecosystem "
Yeah being able to pick scuff marks or cracks in the track and depth perception is what i miss but having an instance response to inputs is cool too
"Happy to help.

To clarify, you need two routers regardless. 5G WiFi should be fine for your main house router as it's got nothing at all to do with the Quest. This was my main point of initial confusion when reading up on all this. Your WiFi 5 router is nothing more than the source of internet for your PC, it never talks to the Quest directly.

Your second, dedicated, cabled router (WiFi 6/6E) is what the Quest connects to. Even if your main router was WiFi 6 you'd still want the second one, as you really need a router dedicated to the Quest and only the Quest, and connected via ethernet to your PC. Yep, it's an additional expense which can be kinda frustrating."
"The VR ecosystem kind of sucks tbh.  The only actual good PCVR headsets are north of $1k.  

Oculus doesn't do real PCVR and their ""solution"" to it is substandard.  Imagine having these incredible lenses with decent resolution screens and then using those great lenses to see compression artifacts?  

Not to mention using USB-C with no other latching mechanism meaning that your friction fit connector gradually gets looser and looser until it starts coming unplugged during a race.   And the additional latency of the video encoding process does have a meaningful impact on consistency and lap times.

You know what's a great VR experience?  A black screen mid-pack at Talladega because the USB-C connection works its way loose.   Or being in a broadcast race and proceeding to straightline the Schumacher-S because... yet another black screen.

WMR is actually pretty solid now that it supports OpenXR and Reverb G2 is a great headset... and then Microsoft has announced its death and the best widely available PCVR headset will become junk in 30 months.

Then the rest of the PCVR ecosystem is fairly good but there's a huge cost jump from something like a Reverb G2 or Quest."
"Thanks for the clarification. I’m getting closer but let me double check. I’ve got my 5G router downstairs plugged into the wall. I’ve got my pc and rig upstairs. For my set up I should try getting a wifi 6 router and where exactly do I plug that into? Do I need to connect that via Ethernet to the 5G router downstairs? Or do I bring the Wi-Fi 6 router up stairs and connect it directly to my pc via Ethernet (and it connects to my 5G via Wi-Fi?

There seems to be so many configurations people explain on Reddit and YouTube and at times it seems contradictory. Or I’m just kind dumb!"
"Yeah it can get confusing, especially with so many conflicts between people claiming different configs do or do not work.

So, you don't touch your 5G router. Nothing needs to be done there. You buy a 6 or 6E router (don't think it matters, I just got a 6E for a little future proofing), set it up as an access point (in the router settings) next to your PC, and connect it to your PC with an ethernet cable.

You then set up Internet Connection Sharing in Windows, to share the 5G internet from your main router with the new WiFi 6 router via the ethernet cable you just plugged in. That takes about 5 seconds. No other cabling required, and no WiFi connection between the two routers. The two routers are ""connected"" by ICS, not via WiFi or cables.

You then connect your Quest to the new router, and it gets internet from the ICS sharing in Windows."
Awesome man thanks so much. Gonna order a router and give it a shot!
"Good luck, hope it works out. Feel like I should reinforce that what seems to work well for some doesn't for others. But I'm really happy with this configuration so far. Now I just need to figure out how to get the Quest to hold a charge when it's cabled directly to power."
"P.s. before you drop cash on a router, be aware there are a few issues with some specific models and the Q3. I think some TP-Link routers are on the list. Check out r/OculusQuest discussions, and apparently the VD Discord is really great, but I haven't been there yet."

"I was going for my SR promo and had a reckless guy behind me In the same spot. Didn’t care about irating, I went to the right.

Dude goes right behind, then waits and goes to pass left and clips my tire for 4x… some people are wild drivers with very little control"
"possible they misjudged it, it happens in real life as well."
"So frustrating that these kinds of things can't be protested. In real racing, it doesn't matter if it's intentional or not (unless caused by a third car or a mechanical). If your lack of skill or decision making causes you to hit someone in the rear and wreck them on a straight, not in a braking zone, with no traffic around, you should be penalized."
There’s a reason they’re lapped in P6
"It’s rookies, this stuff is what happens there"
Someone did exactly the same to me when i was leading. Should have reported him
Slam dunk protest

"why did you try to block him? 


probably would have still been an incident if you didn't try to block but not sure why you did that "
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
"One thing that bugs me about some people on iRacing is they feel they have to stick behind you at all costs.

Try to pull off the racing line to slow down and they’ll follow you for some reason."
"You actually get punished in real life though. This is a punt through and through. That's what's irritating with iRacing. This should be protestable, instead, it's a 4x and for this guy and he keeps going and OPs race is over."
Looks like an honest mistake to me
He must have moved atleast 3.4mm… also known as a bump in the road that twitched his steering wheel a bit. You are acting like he jerked the wheel to the right 😆
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Yep. Had this happen twice yesterday. Killed my SR both times. Plus needing a tow killed my races. Part of me is thinking it’s an Vee thing.
x for both even...
Wreckless driving that ends in a wreck is protestable even if it's not malicious.
That’s how iRacing stewards would see it too
[deleted]
"He should have known better how to safely overtake the leader, this is far from honest"
[deleted]
"But it’s not intentional wrecking though, isn’t that what protests are actually for."
"Bone headed? Yes

Illegal? No"
Thats not little. It’s literally minuscule.
[deleted]
"Illegal according to whom? IRacing doesn't have rules about passing since they don't assess fault, so of course this isn't illegal in iRacing. In any other form of racing, this is a punt."

"Protests should be filed when a competitor violates the Sporting Code.  Infractions include but are not limited to:
•Competition issues
•Voice or Text chat
 •Retaliation or intentional wrecking
 •Blocking
 •Tire heating
 •Fake and/or inappropriate names

https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000133441-how-to-file-a-protest

It was preventable but it wasn’t intentional/malicious wrecking, he just misjudged it."
"Illegal in the sense of: ""will a protest work""

Clearly we're talking about iracing rules since those are the only ones that are relevant here."
You did indeed say little move. But the way you are blaming him is as though you said he jerked the wheel. I’m done. Downvotes appear to be agreeing with me.

"Ah, if it’s not fully on him then the other bit must be on the… crowd. Got it. Damn their booing. Just stop, this is embarrassing 😆"
"If you think you might like open wheel racing, we’d love you over at USF2000! It’s a smaller, usually friendlier class of open wheel racing. The rolling starts also help reduce some of the lap one carnage; statistically it’s some of the cleanest racing in all of iRacing and you get to do a few ovals which don’t require an oval license but DO contribute to your oval license. 

Plus, when you get to C license, if you want to go faster; you could jump into the faster IndyPro car which races the exact same tracks each week. And even race both back to back if you want!"
"Keep at the Mx5 and figure out your long term goal. Moving up for the sake of moving up just means you’re going to have to develop your race craft on a faster car. 

Going to a faster car will also temporarily mask any poor driving. The MX5 is slow but drives exactly like faster cars so you have forever to think about everything and improve lap to lap"
You don’t need to move to anything. I’m A class and still regularly drive the MX5. You will however need to drive one D class series at least 4 times to get a license promotion.
"Keep trying stuff, do some oval, do some tin tops (both miat and 86), do some openwheel and figure out what youre enjoying. 

After you’ve got some experience in what you wanna continue with get something like f4, gt4, ARCA or late model or something (Im still new to oval idk other entry points lmao) and keep doing races until you feel like you want some new challenges. 

Test lots of stuff, I think theres a test session opening up soon so also look for cars that you enjoy driving but are a little much yet (Im trying to get good enough to drive the Lotus 49)

Of course if you have no budget concerns just buy everything but that’s kind of how Ive been finding out what I wanna do"
"Depends what you're looking for.

If you want to get into GT3 and IMSA, then keep going with the MX5 and GR86 and move into GT4 then Pcup. If you're looking for open wheelers, look into F4 and the Vee."
skip barber is where champions are born
"I recently got to D license in the Vee series. I'm continuing in the Vee series since I know it well and know how to drive safely. IRacing is automatically matching me with D and C licensed people. For the next season, I'll switch to something else, but I don't want to learn a new car mid-season and potentially not race as cleanly as might people expect in week 8."
I just set my self up for the remainder of the Falken GT4 series =) I'm stoked for this week. Driving home to work is gonna be something else.
"I wouldn't particularly recommend the GR86. It's perfectly fine, but has very similar pace as the MX-5, and is less fun to drive IMO. Although you can easily try it out and decide for yourself when the Buttkicker Cup or PCC is at a free track.

My recommendation would be the Formula 1600 Trophy. It's the best experience I've had on iRacing by miles. Really close racing, and so clean.

The car is an absolute joy to drive. It feels really nimble and balanced, particularly in a series with open setups where you can use the iRacing track-specific setups. It slides in a really satisfying way, similar to the MX-5, and is really forgiving. And it eats kerbs for breakfast.

Also, apparently you can run the Formula 1600 Trophy and the Formula 1600 Rookie series back to back if you enter the rookie race after qualifying for the Trophy. I've not tried it yet, but I'm planning to do it this week:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/192ibcv/comment/kh2uwlx/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/192ibcv/comment/kh2uwlx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Don't worry about forfeiting the Trophy race in the UI in order to enter the rookie race. You don't actually forfeit the race, you race as normal, and your SR and iR is added to your rating at the end. I've tried it in other series and it definitely works."
Drive the MX5 wherever you like for another season then start digging into the setup for another season.
Ok thanks mate! Might check it out! I definitely want to try open wheels at some point
Makes sense. Appreciate the help!
"ok thanks! Yeah just did an MX-5 race, and was against class C and B players. As a new guy should I drive a few class D races to get promoted to class C at the end of the season?"
Thank you! Based on other comments I think I'll keep driving the MX-5 for now and will give the GR86 a try.
"Skip Barber is a waste of time now. It's going to be phased out of the service soon, it doesn't even race IRL anymore. 


FF1600 has a class d series that's much better. And you actually learn fundamental driving techniques that apply to other cars. "
I heard it's pretty fun to drive! Might give it a shot
I'm pretty sure iracing doesn't match based on sr. Only ir. It's just that the most successful racers in vee tend to be cleaner. There are also a lot of experienced racers in vee for some reason. Presumably farming ir.
"No idea how fast you are but try to get up to 1.7k+ in the MX5. That’ll say you have pace but more importantly race craft and strategy. I went down to about 1k of iR and then it sorta clicked when I shot right up so don’t fret if you’re currently slow. 

VRS has free guides for the rookie MX5 setup which will tell you why you’re slow."
"It'll be nice to get the promotion if your SR is there, but it won't really matter unless you are trying to get into a C series next season. Or if you are worried that you won't make it to/stay at 4+ SR next season to get into C with a mid season promotion."
"> It's going to be phased out of the service soon

There are no plans currently to remove the Skip barber series from iracing and its plenty active.

> And you actually learn fundamental driving techniques that apply to other cars

If you're fast in a Skippy you'll be fast in anything. Anyways, the fastest Formula ford drivers are all Skippy drivers too.

I promise if you learn the car and can compete by the top in the 6-7K SOF broadcast races, there isn't a single car on iRacing you won't also be great at. If you can't compete in the SOF, then theres still plenty the car has left to teach ya"
"Don't, Skip Barber is a waste of time now. It's going to be phased out of the service soon, it doesn't even race IRL anymore. 

FF1600 has a class d series that's much better. And you actually learn fundamental driving techniques that apply to other cars. Also the car is free. "
"I would buy the Ferrari 296 gt3, you can go far with that car."
"> I'm pretty sure iracing doesn't match based on sr. Only ir 


Correct. I assumed that people who got out of rookies would have a higher IR and end up in splits with D and C, but maybe that isn't always the case.


I've driven with a ton of messy Vee drivers, but so far they mostly spin off track, but have taken me out a few times. 


Maybe Mx5 is a wreck fest, I haven't actually driven it in a race. If it is, I might switch to a class D series but practice a lot with AI before hand and stick to the back until I know I won't ruin someone's race."
Thanks so much! I'm at 1431 iR at the moment and just drove my best lap in Oulton Park (1:53.32) a few minutes ago. I'll try to push as high as I can and might run a few class D races later on to get my class C license next season.
Good to know! Thank you!
That car is not a good car for someone right off rookie licenses. It's much more complex and doesn't provide much feedback.
"Yeah, follow this person's advice. I came in mid-season to iracing, and I ended up doing half a season in rookie Mazda and then 2 seasons jumping between rookies, Advanced Mazda, and PCC. That way, you get short races, a D class multi class race, and a C class half-hour single make series with open setups.

You can get comfortable in the car without getting bored and spending loads of money on tracks. The goal I set myself was consistently finishing in the top half of top split and having a B license. That's when I was happy with my basic understanding of racing a car. 

The logical next step is either GR86 or GT4. I've been running GT4 for close to a year now, and I'm still learning and having fun."
"They can utilize practice and race AI to learn the mechanics of it all and gain the confidence to race in the series. 

I would definitely buy that car as it will take me in multiple series of Iracing and not spend a ton on car selections."
"Will be going that route then. Thank you for the advice! So unrelated question, I did a race yesterday and finished P7 (started P11 because game froze at the beginning of qualifying and couldn't get a lap done before the race begun). Do you only gain points only when finishing in the top half? I was racing against class C and B players and still lost 8 points. Couldn't find anything about that in the sporting code."
"The Ferrari Challenge is where SR goes to die. The other GT3 classes aren't available at D level right? 

I respect your opinion, but it's a hard disagree from me."
"IRating is totally separate from safety rating and your license. Everyone starts at the same amount and then it’s a zero sum game. The Strength of Field will give you a gauge of how fast the split is, the higher the SOF is compared to your rating means that you can finish further back and not lose rating. If the SOF is really low compared to yours then you’ll have to finish pretty far forward to not lose any."
"So, just to clarify my earlier point, I say finish top half for two reasons. The main reason is because that shows you've got good pace and consistency in the car so you've got a good grip in the fundamentals, the smaller reason is that a top half finish will normally increase your irating. While irating doesn't matter, some people (including myself sometimes) let it dictate whether the race they just had was fun or not, and a gaon serves as motivation.

Onto your question, I believe the way irating loss/gain is calculated is something like where you finished in a 1v1 battle against every driver on the grid and the irating gains and losses for each of those 1v1s get added together. If you've got a higher car number than a driver, you are expected to beat them, and you'll gain irating if you do, and the reverse is true. The amount of gain and loss is more or less determined by the difference in irating. So if you are by far the lowest rated car out of 12, for example, you might be able to finish 9th and gain irating."
"Maybe the Ferrari challenge has changed and is now terrible? I didn’t have a bad experience in the Ferrari challenge, but I haven’t raced it in about a year."
Okay gotcha! I did lose a 1v1 battle during the race (let the other player pass in a turn) as I didn't want him to hit me or hit him either. Trying to finish races clean as much as I can while trying to run good times.
"As in most things, compromise is key"
Wait....so he couldn't overtake you so expected to be let theough? Have I understood this right 🤣
"Had the exact same discussion on a Nordschleife race.
I qualify, but get into a pretty high split for my pace (I was like last in entry out of 28+ cars)

Dude somewhere behind me did not qualify, but is faster.
Catches up in one of the many parts of Nord's where you physically cannot pass.
He tries anyway and somehow we don't die.
Of course I still don't let him pass, we are racing for position and it's only a 3 Lap race, but I also don't defend super hard 
He could have passed me 5 times on the straights already if he had any race craft, but he tries making moves into every single corner where you can't pass.

Finally gets by me on the long straight, shouts at me in chat after the race.
""If someone is faster, just let them through""
Me: ""if you are faster, why are you starting behind me""
He tried coming up with some weak argument about me blocking or whatever but I just left."
I'm.so confused as to what's been discussed here
The number of people who do not comprehend that racing is not hot lapping in traffic is too damn high.
"What a bitch mentality. Not everybody is racing for a win. I mean, maybe you THINK you are, but sorry princess, maybe you just aren't fast enough. And think about it.... You aren't fast enough to easily pass the 5th place guy but somehow you're fast enough to pass 4th, 3rd, 2nd, AND 1st? Do they think teams like Haas in F1 are racing for a win every time they go out? Lol."
I’ve been asked “why are you passing me on lap one for 21st place?” And apparently saying “it’s called a race” makes some people very upset
"For context, top split F3 race on Mugello. From around lap 4 -> 9 Green was following and would get the run down the straight but each time I'd move to the inside before T1, get the exit, hold position through the next 2 essess and he wouldnt get a good enough run until T1 again, rinse and repeat. This was for P5.  


Red was behind him and we were all running really close, a 4th car joined this fight and it all culminated to a 3 wide situation through T1, the essess, but got involved in a racing incident shortly after. Thought it was great racing until we finished and Green got upset I 'held him up'.  


For reference too if someone closes a big gap quickly and I know I dont have a chance then I wont hold them up, this wasn't the case, his only real chance at a move was T1 and until we went 3 wide that was the only spot he tried the move but he couldnt make it stick, that's text book good racing in my opinion and I thought all 4 cars in the battle were being respectful and fair, him included.  


TL;DR: If you can't get past dont be sour about it"
Lack of racecraft is incredible. Some drivers wants to start from behind and have open passage lol
I’m a big believer in blue flags not having to change their race line to make way for race leaders. But I had a race the other day where I was battling for 3rd and a back marker was battling with me like crazy. Taking dives left and right to get in front of me then I’d pass him back and this went on for 3 to 4 laps and eventually he spun out and I narrowly avoided him. I would have been pissed if it took me out of the race. In the case where he is sooooo far behind and potentially ruining the race for someone that is going to place well they need to make space. It doesn’t sound like this is what happened in your instance OP but there are cases where a blue flag should concede.
"There’s a dude who frequents F4 who has really inconsistent pace but can occasionally put fast laps in. He is CONSTANTLY screaming into the mic demanding people let him pass (and I’m not talking about lapped cars) because he’s “faster” than them and it’s “not fair” that they won’t let him by. 

The number of folks on iRacing who have no idea how racing works is staggering."
What is the gap between p4-p5?
"Some dude found me in the forums to message me and complain that I didn't let him through because he was #3 in the lobby.

Absolute nut house behavior."
"Eh, I see getting stuck behind someone a second or two of my pace as good practice. Was behind a car like that for like 7 laps of Porsche cup last night. Still pretty new and not confident enough in the car to pass often but I was getting plenty of looks and practice since I could catch up in 2-3 turns if I screw up taking a different line."
"There are too many drivers that expect everyone to pull over for them.

I even raced in a league where this was a pretty big discussion, one driver actually tried to argue that if they were faster by 0.1 second a lap, the ""slower"" car should pull over, and plan to pit and quit..."
"There so many great people in iRacing and other Sims, but the hobby definitely has its share of assholes."
"Getting a lot of this in GT4 at Sandown this week.  People asking to be let through, but don't understand it's a race and isn't just given to you.  Then they get upset when they try to divebomb and fail."
I’ve had faster cars catch up and suggest i let him through and we’ll work together to get past the car in front.
"Yeah, now imagine this only it’s for the win. I wasn’t even taking a defensive line, he just couldn’t get past me, and claimed I was “blocking” by running the normal racing line. I was at about the same 1.5k rating I am now, he was somewhere south of 500. 

Afterwards he actually protested me over it, the next week we happened to be in the same race same cars again and he was absolutely flabbergasted that I wasn’t “on vacation” started trying to tell people how terrible I was and that I was a massive blocker, etc. 

Yeah, guess who was DQ’d for incident points before Lap 10. Beat part is, he didn’t start accumulating them every lap until around Lap 4, when he started cutting corners and just hitting people to try and get around them."
"That's it, maybe this post wasn't as clear as I had hoped haha"
"Fuck em

Unless I can see the shit load of time I will lose is going to cost me in the long run, for example I don't want to fall out of the slipstream train on a track with long straights or it is the first 25% of a race, I love defending hard against someone who I know is faster. As long as its clean, thats what racing is about.

Being good at defending is as good as being good at overtaking. They are both worth places.

Unfortunately, there are a sad entitled few who think racing is a time trial so should be let through instead of actually racing."
I think the guy in p6 expected to be let through lool
"My bad, I was halfway throguh typing up a comment and made myself lunch haha"
"I mean, I have no idea who that guy is... but I've definitely met him before..."
![gif](giphy|NWg7M1VlT101W)
"In my story no one is a blue flag, all racing for position.

I do agree with your view though, I try to not hold up an active fight if possible though"
"Around 3s and dropping, p4 was in clean air and not fighting while 4 of us were battling for the same peice of road"
"I had a guy once complain to me that ""if I weren't so shit on exit you could have passed the guy in front of you"". I was about to say to him after the race that I thought he was going to get me several times by the end and that it was a good race. Little did I know he was probably crying to himself being a little bitch because I didn't let him pass me lol."
"At least I didn't receive any PMs, but this guy was the #1 in that session. I however was the number 5, so logically I felt p5 was my goal for the race."
"Something a lot of people don't do when practicing is actually practice. They just try to hot lap and get fast lap times. Which is all well and good, learn the track and learn to be fast.

But you gotta practice things like taking suboptimal lines, as well. When you're actually racing people is a bad time to be taking a tricky corner in a completely different way than when you're alone on the track."
"Oh and this I'm totally for, have been helped and helped others this way"
"I was doing an SF race yesterday, and me, p2 and p1 were covered by 8 seconds all race running at the same pace - had no chance of catching unless one made a mistake which we never did.

Wish I had a go at them now and told them to move out my way......."
"It was perfectly clear, its just the other guys idiocy is hard to believe. 😂"
"I just assumed it was a blue-flag and I probably would have defended you even then, sometimes playing nice and letting them lap you gets you in trouble, it's their job to pass. The fact it was the guy 1 pos behind you is hilariously dumb from him."
The other guy probably doesn’t know that blue flags don’t mean the same thing in different series and should read up on the iRacing guidelines hahaha
I can't stand people whom would have been in the top 5 of qualifying but don't and start in the back and bully their way to the front.
"Literally this, We were hard racing, I was taking a defensive line. Only after the race I found out he thought I was holding him up. Diddems."
"Oh that old chestnut 

I once had a guy complain I wouldn't let him past because apparently I was too slow and should get out of his way 

Sadly in that instance he got annoyed and punted me off ruining my race to then crash about 4 laps later and quit the lobby 

Some people just shouldn't race"
😂🤣😂🤣
Oh yeah I was confused and only realised after I posted.
Yeah I’ve actually never lost a race because of this. I just ask them to let me to the front and I’m good to go.
"It wasn't even a blue flag situation, it was for position hahaha

More to that point though so many people just seem to think that their race is the only thing important, dudes at the back battling are perfectly entitled to fight and if they can't get out of the way without compromising their race they don't have to get out of the way just yet. This is unfortunate but that is the nature of racing"
I’ve had a few races when people were thinking they were faster and then realise they can’t pull away because of the draft
"No wayyyyyy
I assumed the only way someone might be this entitled was if you had a blue flag and they *thought* it meant you have to give way, 
You could possibly report green for toxic chat behaviour because the context of their messages is kind of nasty"
"If people is lapping you, you are responsible for safely letting them through. That doesn’t mean stop racing - it means you need to understand in which point of the circuit will be safe to do that and ideally it wouldn’t compromise your race."
"I race off hours a lot, so lobbies end up having some pretty big IR gaps. Indycar at Talladega a couple seasons back, single split race. Top IR was in the 5k range. Bottom was sub-1k.

Worst race I ever had. The lower IR guys constantly trying moves thinking they had the hottest of rods and running their mouths on chat like they were the love child of Mario Andretti and Helio Castroneves. Only to suddenly not have the hot rod anymore and getting passed. Several would attempt to ram or throw late blocks. Even heard at least one making cheating accusations.

It was absolutely wild. It's like all these C class drivers had never heard of the draft before. Which made no sense because half the accents of these idiots clearly placed them in the Nascar primary demographic."
"OP wasn’t lapped it was my bad assumption 

But also In the iRacing sporting code (5.1.7.5) a blue flag is purely informational and not a direction given by the stewards, it is “recommended” a slower car makes a reasonable effort to facilitate a safe pass but it is the responsibility of the faster car to make the pass. 

the same sporting code section states a slower car should maintain a consistent line which means if you’re trying to be courteous and getting out of the way for a passing car you are in the wrong. And if a crash is caused from it you’d be in trouble as you didn’t hold your racing line (technically speaking)"
no. it is their responsibility to pass safely.
"Currently living this he'll because I switched to load cell pedals and got back into races too quickly,  so now my ratings are trash. 😭"
"I've not hated single split lobbies with big IR gaps in the past because they can be fun, but this reminded me of Indy road last week. I was running in 3rd, a gap to 4th of 4.5s that was shrinking slowly but running in 1st was Will Power. Personally I just wanted to accolade of saying ""I've finished on the podium with Will Power"".

Coming up to lap 10 of 19, caught up to a back marker who was, and I'm not embellishing, 15s off pace. I got along side heading into a good overtaking opportunity and he drives across me nearly wiping me out. Next corner does the same thing, and again and again. Heading into corners he also braked way too hard, way too early causing more close calls despite even being ready for it. He was also taking a defensive line but tbh I think he just wasn't sure where to put the car to he fast. The overtake literally had to be done down the straight or this moron was 100% taking you both out.

This lap of pain cause p4 to close that nice gap and when I made the pass, p4 was able to follow me through on my line and not be held up. Did manage to hold him off and secure p3 but I was ready to type up the biggest report of my life.

As for the other guy, I could tell whenever he was caught up to because the lobby started going bananas at him for blocking them all from getting by"
Man that's a brave move. I don't even like doing stuff like that in A class events and that guy attempted it in rookies.
"I always pucker when I know someone’s likely to take things three wide. I think netcode may have helped, because you can see the left car cut across his nose before visible contact ever happened. Still, that was definitely a very aggressive, not smart move. I hate to say it, but moments like this can actually help you in the long run. They all end up informing your instinct, which hopefully makes it easier to sense rapidly increasing risk. That’s the sort of instinct that helps you know when to back off to make it through two wide in places where you shouldn’t but got stuck, make room to survive idiots like this, foresee wrecks before they happen, etc."
sometimes being more defensive is the best move. The guy initially to your left shouldn't have opened that door but if he was going to he should have giving more room. if I was you.... in hindsight I might have drifted a bit left to close the hole if I thought the guy behind might go for it.
Gained 2 places he'll probably do it again
It was a 2030 SOF race and his was around 1900. Would expect some more common sense 😕
"The rookies is the best place to do it, as long as you never want to leave the rookies. IRacing tries to hide your irating in rookies, but the mobile app still tells you what it is. You can tank your safety rating, knock your opponents out of the race, and brag about your high irating. "
There's a fine line between brave and stupid.
"That's maybe also the disadvantage of racing on 1 screen. Was difficult to get a feeling how much space there was between me and the guy on the left, I thought we were fairly close and there was no room for a car in between. Otherwise could have closed the door a bit more or give him room by going to the right..."
"Yeah I'm only using 1 screen and have to use buttons on my wheel to look left and right. I quickly checked where he was and thought I was already close to guy him so I kept my line... in hindsight, it would have been better to close the door."
What do you race primarily?
"I don't know about any existing Discord groups, but it might help to mention your age and your time zone. That would help people know if you'd be a good fit.  


I'm new to iRacing, but I've been driving ACC and AMS2 for a while. I'd be up for helping where I can. I'm in my late 30s and in US Central Time."
I’m thinking I’ll start one. Been on the service 3 years and going no where forward fast so may as well go back and help start budding dreamers 😆
Broken Wing Racing League is awesome. Look them up.
"some good chaps on here. We do some fun hosted stuff on a wednesday evening (mainly European based racers) with a good range of experience.

"A lot of Twitch streamers have good communities.  They hang out in chat and have a discord for more direct questions.  Twitch iRacing community is very solid.  You'll see a lot of the same ""faces"" in a variety of channels hanging out.  Give it a shot."
"just race dude, all that is going to do is cause drama. More voices more drama."
"Try to enter in some leagues, usually they have a discord server. Maybe entering at some one that is newbie friendly you will make good friends at the game"
I only race road atm
I'm mid twenties on central Europe time
Otherwise I’m on the hunt for iRacing friends. People to practice with and create a team and what not.
"Thanks, I'll check it out"
"Thanks, I'll have a look :)"
"Highly highly recommend giving this a read. 

https://www.ricmotech.com/assets/images/driver-position/Driver-Position.pdf

Limited adjustability with the setup, but I’m sure you can find ways to get a more comfortable position. I’d bet lap times would improve just by getting the wheel closer and getting some bend in those arms"
Them young racers are the best. They don’t have the fear like an older kid just learning. Let him cook mom!!!!
Time to invest in karting. No substitute for seat time
"Most orgs like SCCA and NASA allow you to race when you're 13 and a half, btw. Get them in karts now so they can make the transition to cars as early as possible."
Curious what the green screen is doing in this case?
"The wheel is the way to far away, his arms need to be angled"
"Dad: Bend your arms son, you drive like your mom."
Don’t be like a friend of mines mom and wait to let him start until he’s older and then if he doesn’t run good give up on him and send him back to iRacing. That’s all I have to say.
"Lucky kid !

Maybe buy him a real simrig before thinking race car ;)"
16 will be too late
Start when he’s 16?  That’s awfully late. I’d highly suggest getting him out there as early as possible if you can. I started at 11 and it took me a few years to catch up.
Laptop specs? I might try vr
"Ok but wtf is that posture 😭😭😭 do him a favour and get him closer to the wheel, and the pedals"
Hell yeah little dude
Tell her how a 17 year old ran in the 24hr and won today. And how the same guy did it last year at 16
I started quarter midgets at 10 but they allow kids at age 5. Some of my best memories
So That's why there are wonky drivers in rookies I often wondered what's going threw people's heads sometime and I just got the answer lol
He's getting a real race car for his 16th birthday? Suck a lucky boy :o
bro just goes in ovals and hes the best thing thing. gg go next
"Time for a divorce 💪💪💪 
go on Young man put that peddle to the metal. better than sitting on street corners 😎"
100%.  There's a reason that stock car (and other racing) steering wheels are so close to the driver relative to how most folks drive their daily cars.
"This! Thank you so much. We literally started on Christmas Day with a very inexpensive PXN wheel. I am not afraid to get spendy in order help him chase any passion. He is on my setup in the video. His is a little more conducive to his size, but we still have a long way to go. He has the G920 now for the Xbox. I am slowly letting him get into the better equipment. With that being said, I am excited to put a full motion rig in this garage in the next 6 months if he stays this engaged."
"I've done karting for 10 years as a hobby and while I can say that it was definitely a huge factor in developing my driving style and racecraft, but I feel like this is something that can be achieved in the sim aswell. 

I agree that there's nothing superior to IRL seat time. However, the time and money commitment is much greater. And ultimately, I feel like racing in the sim for a couple nights a week does more for you than hitting the track twice a month and getting maybe 3-4 hours of actual seat time per day.

There's also the factor of coaching. Sim racing allows you to reach out to coaches all over the world, who can watch and give feedback in real time."
🚀
The one you see is not serving a purpose at all (other than blocking light when the garage door is open). There is another one setup (out of shot) that I use for zoom meetings since the garage is unfinished.
For sure. He is bungeed into this one and can push himself all over. Test and tune area for equipment. I want a full motion rig now 😂

He has his own setup that is actually setup for him. This is a test and tune spot. It will all be dialed in soon!
"Ha! I get where you’re coming from, but he won’t be running rookies for a long time."
can you adopt me
Take that money and spend it on a kart if they are really enjoying it. Don't be afraid to take a step into something you're not familiar with. You can sell the kart later if it doesn't work.
"True but I think he had enough set backs in his life to deserve some fortune such as being homeless at 11, being the laughingstock of the school at 14 losing two father figures at 15 to old age or a car accident while trying to be a race car driver.

"Best tip I can give as a newish user. Don't buy anything.  I'm a road racer who always thought oval was 'stupid'. I knew I'd be going down the gt/f1 route. Well, what a fool I was. 

I've fallen in love with oval racing. It's freaking amazing. Road you have battles in the race, but this is on another level, cars spinning left and right, bumber to bumper with thr car in front and behind, then someone is over taking in the inside and out, so much fun."
"I can’t advise buying everything at once; I can advise looking at https://irpa.racestatcentral.com/ to figure out what purchasing X tracks and Y cars will mean for you for the rest of this season (and as you are planning next season)

I definitely don’t recommend buying cars before you have the license to use them."
"Concentrate on buying tracks but only after you've gotten out of rookies and decided what series you want to participate in.  

Buying a bunch of cars doesn't sound like a good idea as this isn't a car collection game.  Once you find a series buy the tracks for that season, see if you really enjoy the car/series and do the same thing for the next season.  Soon you will have all of the popular tracks and a better idea of what you like."
GT3 meta car changes near every week. If youre not alien fighting for wins in top split it usually doesnt matter that much. 992 cup isnt a bad car just hard to drive and will def teach you a lot. TCR is kinda dead(ish). If you really wanna do tcr theres still enough people that you can but if you dont really care for it you dont miss much. Its very different to drive compared to RWD cars for obvious reasons so learning to drive it doesnt help that much with other cars.
"Find what you like, and buy content as you go. That extra 30% off is great, but you get 100% off for not buying content you don’t really want. I’d recommend getting through rookies, then get a GT4 and some of the tracks for that series and just keep climbing the ladder in the cars you want."
"Purchase one of the cars for a series you're interested in which is running on one of tracks you're interested in. Race that for a week.


Enjoyed the car? Want to race a season in it? Then start purchasing tracks and possible one of the other cars you want that have a decent overlap in tracks. GT4 and LMP3 follows the same tracks and drive very differently, has good participation and run a good variation of tracks. 


The GT4s are decent cars to drive, but as always, hard to drive really fast. They teach you a lot about how use your brakes to get a car to turn and using trail breaking. 


There isn't really a meta as most cars are well balanced in performance, and unless you're in the top 1% in the series it doesn't matter anyway. 


No need to purchase more than six items as the same time to get the rebate either. "
"I'll echo others opinions and say buying so much stuff so early may not be the best use of your money. You never know what series you will enjoy doing.

There is a new 12-week schedule released every 13 weeks. My personal suggestion is wait for each schedule to be released, and buy a few things that you need for that specific schedule. There are discounts for buying 6+ pieces of content at a time, which you should be able to take advantage of each season."
">I've decided to take a ""buy once, cry once"" approach when it comes to acquiring cars and tracks.

If you're set on that route you might as well suck it up and get your 40 piece discount on your first purchase. You'll then have 20% off on the initial purchase and all single purchases going forward.

Otherwise I will echo others. Pick a series of interest and maybe grab 6 pieces you know you would want regardless of what is scheduled and then buy them by the 6 or so based on what the next season has to offer. There's basically zero upsides to going over 6 unless you go right to 40 especially without knowing if they'll be on a schedule for the series you want to race."
"My 2¢ on the cars: 

Don’t get the F4, F3, and Super Formula. I have all three, I wish I didn’t have the F3. F4 drives completely differently from the other two. The F3 feels like a very slow sf/slightly faster f4 that teaches non of the throttle control you need for the sf. 

Similarly, I purchased the p217, then the Cadillac GTP. I much prefer the p217 to the point of regretting the GTP. I don’t have the lmp3 l, but I’d fear you’d have the same experience.

If it were me: Ferrari 296, F4, Super Formula, P217. Then get the tracks needed in chunks of at least 3 as needed."
"What??? Why would you buy so much? Just buy what you need, when you need in, in lots of 3+ if you have to (you don't have to). I have now bought 13 tracks and 23 cars, and certainly could have done without some of the cars. (The tracks ended up being worth it because I stuck around, but what if I hadn't?)"
As for tracks I would avoid zolder and maybe add lemans or autodromo Jose Carlos pace
"I wanted to road race and thats all ive done. I didn't buy anything until I was out of Rookies class, then I bought what I thought I needed for d class (just 1 or 2 cars, and filled in tracks that seemed frequently used, making sure to take advantage of the buy 6 discount for content). Repeat for C and B class. By the time I got to A, I had most all of what I needed and just buy new things as they get released or if I decide to try something new. 

To get the 6 item discount, I'd look at the schedules of the classes I was going to race (or wanted to race in the future) and bought tacks that appeared on multiple schedules. I prioritized tracks over cars, as in my mind a tracks can be used in multiple series, whereas cars usually cannot. 

Another thing is to wait for the downtime every season and test to see what car you want in a given class. In GT3, there are so many options and, for example, the 911 may suit your driving style a lot more than the mercedes."
"Fellow newbie here, I started in week 1 of this season and I bought 4 items once I got my C license:

HPD ($3 car which doesn't count toward discount)
Ferrari 296 GT3
Monza
Sebring

This allows me to run road races each week in a non-rookie series. GR86 and ProtoGT this week, ProtoGT next week and then Ferrari challenge for the rest of the season. There is also some overlap with other series like the production car challenge and thrust master FF1600.

Doing this will give you some new content and series to run for this season, and let you wait until next season's schedule comes out. Once that happens you'll be able to decide what series you want to focus on and see which tracks you will need. It'd be a shame to buy that many tracks and see a bunch of them not featured next season, or not featured in a series that you want to run."
"New users should always try to put in a season on the free content before buying anything. You never know where you will fit in, or even if you will like it at all. Give it a bit of time and your path will become a lot clearer."
"I'm sure there are others out there, but I was an original beta tester back in 2008. I had the priveldge of unlocking all the content that existed at the time, which has held me over until the last year or so. Quite a bit of stuff has been moved to legacy or just isn't used any more over the last year.

If I had to do it all from scratch I would pick a series that interests me right then and purchase what I need to run then. If I still want to run it the week after, purchase the next track, so on and so forth. If you don't want to dump a bunch of money in, getting comfortable with one car for a season might be the best way. I would imagine jumping series every week would get quite expensive."
"So depending on how you want to race, i would suggest at first sticking to one car and series to save from spending on tracks that might not be used, for example the ferrari is a great car to get as it unlocks multiple series, you can run ferrari fixed, gt3 fixed, vrs, imsa and imsa fixed. I personally would buy that and check one of them series and buy all the tracks on that season most likely next season you wont need to but as many tracks as there will probably be a repeat track, after doing this for a year and adding a new car every season you wont be purchasing much content at all!"
"don’t need to buy 25 items at once. as long as you get 5/6 you already receive the bulk discount.

also zolder and brands hatch are rarely rarely used"
![gif](giphy|Ae7SI3LoPYj8Q)
"Same. Started road, loving oval in a way that I didn’t know I could.

Feel your way around the service before you invest heavily. You’re not missing out on anything you can’t buy immediately. And you’re not sitting on $300 worth of content you may or may not or use."
Oval racing is so fun! I’ve never been a huge fan of watching it but boy oh boy even using a formula wheel truck series is so fun
Same happened to me. I got to class B oval before I ever went Road. Thought ovals would be boring. It's exciting.
I'll put my hand up for dirt ovals. They're incredible fun!
"This ☝🏾. At first I wanted to get out of rookie leagues and it was my goal to reach A license so I can start driving the “Good” stuff, the fast cars. I created a whole bunch of bad driving habits that made me take a step back. I’m now two years into the service and I realize I really enjoy the GR86 Buttkicker Cup and thriving in that series. It allowed me to relearn and focus on cleaner, strategic and smarter driving race craft. GR86 is all I race and I just focused on buying tracks for that series. I now have pretty much every track for any road series when I feel ready to try a new series. Probably GT4 car in the future. Focus on 1 or 2 cars and learn them inside out."
"The problem is he hasn't been protested yet for it. You can change that...please do.

I don't think it's explicitely mentioned in the sporting code, but I promise you it's a thing and the protest will be upheld."
"P p p p p p PROTEST THAT SHIZZLE

Unsafe rejoins are one of the only incidents which are truly 100% avoidable. Please do the community a solid and protest so the person gets either educated or some time away from iracing to learn there lesson. Keep that shizzle on forza/F1 where it belongs 😂"
Looks like maybe he was hoping the grass would just 360 him but didn’t commit to it so just rolled thru - send him packing.
![gif](giphy|2WdHaCzmqSkrwmIGWP)
"Woah, that’s some real hang time"
Unsafe entry is definitely protest worthy.
Maybe connect with this guy : https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/hO2NZw13Yz
"The other possibility you didn't consider is that another iRacer actually did reach out to them on Facebook about a totally different incident (maybe one they didn't even recall) and they just got mixed up and assumed it was you. 


Ultimately, this protest definitely will not be upheld and you won't get penalised for it, so don't worry too much. "
Now I think both posts were made up
"This missed connection is like the Pina Colada song, except weirder. "
You don't mention anything from iracing thought. Which i wouldn't really expect to get a response to a protest given it's the weekend. It's kinda interesting thought.  Because someone i think this morning posted a facebook conversation that basically matches the protest description here
This is getting good
[We have been waiting for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/wQD4AE0ea6). This is getting juicy.
"Hi Everyone for clarification, I reported the wrong person because I had no replay and was confused because no in-game names matched and I thought the message said he finished in 16th. I replied to iRacing and am hoping they can remove my protest on OP."
"This sounds familiar. This thread went viral even. Could be a good chance to clear your name if you are legit

https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/X58LasQOCa"
This would never happen in ACC (because no online races)
Why I don’t use my real name
We need the next thread to be „Got picked up by the police for violation of iRacing terms although I don’t even have iRacing“
"Huh. So someone was berating and harassing me on discord and this was iRacing's response when I filed a protest against them. Clearly they were just completely lying to me....

https://preview.redd.it/ef67zg1z57fc1.png?width=3234&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b59ba878bc17a613141ca2236d3c571f47390e3"
its super odd that the other person doesnt like being harassed by random people on facebook but engaged with them immediately then played victim. He is the victim dont get me wrong but if you dont want to get into an argument with a random person on facebook.... dont engage. block and move on.
What in the kindergarden is this
"the stewards in iracing are fucking retarded

int wreckers get the all clear and normal shit gets banned....

nim, you're a fucking idiot"
"Wow, what a loser"
Dan Brpwn was banned from iRacing for thirty years on false accusations. The now 70 year old says „all I want is justice“
Lol reddit is funny. Thus is either a troll post or funny as funck.
"No way, that’s even the correct series and the description is a perfect match."
"Im officially naming myself lead detective on this case and I say something isnt right here.. Did you see this OPs comment on that first post, now? Kind of.. Strange"
"It makes sense. The other post says ""they don't go by their ign"" -> implies that the person on fb is indeed not who OP thought. Excellent reason why iRacing doesn't and shouldn't use outside-service evidence.

Did this OP go from 16th to 4th?"
I just added proof to my post. This is not made up.
"Probably not, just what a dog shit system promotes..abuse"
Lol!!!  Nice connection!
"The pina colada song is about a guy in a boring relationship that goes to cheat on his wife with someone he meets in the personal section of the newspaper who ends up being his wife also trying to cheat on him and then they fall in love with eachother again..


This isn't quite the same lol"
Get the popcorn!
"May the council of Reddit decide my fate. I plead ""Not guilty""."
It's too bad you can't protest the guy who actually did it. Harassing you like that through FB is unbelievable.
The fact thet u can misreport anyone based on anything is just lame. Iracing took the shit here
Thank you for the link. This incident is an exact match.
Sad but true.
"ACC main here, x2. The max they could do is to insult you on chat and then leave. At least your Steam profile doesnt appear in the game.

this would happen more on one of the 20 Monza servers with GT3s (how original)"
No online races in ACC? What?
How did you pick a name to go by?
![gif](giphy|AssqAJR8ib5WmCNGOU|downsized)
Not a troll post. Check the proof that I posted. This actually happened. No idea what the odds are…
*the plot thickens*
"It just got updated, turns out the first poster did in fact missreport OP. Mystery solved."
"Mr. Detective, what can I do to prove the legitimacy of this case? I don't want to be the main suspect anymore."
"I was one lap down by the end of the race, got taken out in the second or third lap. Finished 16th."
"Yeah you're correct that I was incorrect about the people, the person who started 16th actually DNF'd on lap 2 which I why I thought the message said they finished 16th and names being different fueled the fire of confusion."
That would be my appeal. That it was not me and that there is no proof that it was me who sent those messages.
"> Excellent reason why iRacing doesn't and shouldn't use outside-service evidence.

Wouldn’t that mean that people could harass other drivers as much as they want on other services with no consequences? Not sure if that is what we want, either."
Now we just need the third guy who actually messaged me to make a post and we'll have all sides (and maybe actually find out his user name lol)
Wierd man coz the other dude was like how the hell did he get my information.
Nobody races online in ACC
" I initially paid with PayPal so my name wasn’t automatically filled from my credit card details. 

I’ve heard others have emailed Iracing and asked to change their first or last name so they can’t be indentified."
Then thank the gods of reddit.
"Wow, you actually monitored the thread? That’s some dedication right there! Thank you lead detective for solving this case!"
Wild!
"Man, with how psychotic that FB dude was I don’t blame you for wanting to bring them to justice asap. Shame an innocent got caught in the crossfire :-("
"No, because there are laws and ToS that govern those interactions. It's not iracing's job to police other platforms."
That would be interesting!
That's... just not true at all.
I can confirm this. Had my name changed a few months ago because I wanted to get rid of the number at the end.
I will always the thankful for the blessing! Praise the Reddit gods!
Sorry we doubted you in the beginning there.
"The amount of effort it would take to do anything through the legal system is going to make that a non-starter, if the person even happens to be the same legal jurisdiction at all.

There is no guarantee that the other platforms will enforce their ToS, or even have a ToS that would cover the same things iracing does."
"Oh, but it is. "
"No worries, a detective has to question everything."
Sure thing bud.
"Thanks for understanding lol 

So I read the edits to the original post but are the details shared somewhere? If not would you mind sharing how exactly the misidentification was made linking you to the FB harrasser? 😂 Such a wild missed commection"
"A couple servers with 10 drivers a day isn't significant enough to boost ACC out of the ""nobody drives it"" territory"
"I can share the email from iRacing when I am back home later today. However it‘s pretty vague. They are pretty much just saying that the name of the harasser not matching any driver name lead to confusion. 

So basically they did not validate that it was actually me."
"What a weird oversight lol so Im guessing your driver name was just close enough to the Facebook offender, or.. Did they just pick a driver to punish based on the description the facebook guy gave of the race?"
As far as I know it had something to do with my position at the end of the race. If you check the screenshot in the other thread you can see that the harasser mentioned the 16th place - which is the place I finished in. This might be as simple as a misunderstanding in the heat of the moment.
"This may sound dumb, but gently move the cable around plugged into the bottom of the handbrake and see if it changes. Assuming you have calibrated everything already."
Plug it in to the back of the wheel base and try calibrating it that way
"If it's just for fun does it really matter what car is ""the best""
When imsa was at le mans a few weeks ago. Bmw and merc seemed to be the top split car choices mostly"
Bmw is pretty much the quickest.
"Which ever one you prefer and suits your driving style 

Unless your a top tier driver with like 3k+ IR you won't be getting the max outta the car OP or not"
Better take GTE and BMW/Porsche
"Thank you, guys!🙂"
"Lets be honest, 90% of the drivers in top split just look at what sets the fastest lap time and go with that they don't even bother looking beyond that. And then the lower splits just copy that because ""Haase is doing 57's in the lambo so better go with the car that tries to kill me every 2nd lap""

Suzuka has been a blast this week with me cruising and taking all the curbs in my BMW and the lambo's around me killing themselves with the slightest touch of exit curb on 130R."
"I’m almost 4k and am not even close to getting the potential out of any car, choosing what fits your driving style is way more important. 

In GTE I am fastest in the RSR but it’s always sketchy, I run consistent laps in the  BMW on every track so that’s what I race."
Normally I agree. But Le Mans is one track where the characteristics are such an outlier that a mortal can easily have huge differences in pace by switching cars.
I think you need dynamic track graphic option on and it does take awhile. I think I’ve only ever noticed it after full length NiS races and endurance races.
About 12 hours into endurance races they are very visible and will even make noise coming off other cars or your own when you go into them
"That would be why then, thank you!"

"Yeah, this happens unfortunately. It's been posted a few times and the consensus seems to be you just have to take it. It's better than ruining everyone else's race by trying to check up."
This combination has been brutal for these. Between these and the yellow coming out with half the field not yet at the start line screwing the pace car up. So glad Indy tracks are back next season.
"Yeah some of the penalties seem heavy handed and stupid. I got Into a wreck at daytona in the rookie pickups and careened into the pits. I got a ""entering pits unsafely"" penalty. Like wtf."
Really wish they would get rid of this rule in indycar. They don't have a rule like this IRL.
"Yea I had something similar earlier, I was in fourth and there was a lap down car ahead of me, as we approach checkered line he starts braking to let me go, I get it he wanted to let me fight w front back, but slowing down at critical point I was like half a foot in front of him as we crossed cause I wasn’t ready for it, drive through penalty the lap after I pitted was real annoying"
It doesn’t help that the track temp is screwed up making the cars really slick and hard on tires. Vegas next week should be pretty good
"Yeah I’ve gotten that too, I actually saved it and didn’t hit anything, get an entrance violation and speeding. I understand it would almost be impossible to code into the game such specific instances and can’t have a live steward in every race. Doesn’t make it any less frustrating when it happens though, especially in a race time that can exceed an hour."
If he wouldve been on the inside near the apron it would’ve been fine since you can pass on the outside before getting to the line
"True, he said it was first time so it was forgiven, shit happens when racing, it was my first week in the series as well and I think it’s my new favorite series ngl"
Are these all clips from iracing? Some of the stuff I’ve never seen before
Like what?
not an oval guy on iracing but watch a fair bit IRL. 33 laps seems short. are you sure you are starting with full fuel?
"Dumb question, but does the AI roster you are using have the Gen 4, or is using ARCA? Sounds much more like the ARCA fuel window."
"Yes, Gen 4 drinks the gas! 900 hp and turns well
over 9000rpm. You can back out early entering and get in it later exiting to stretch the fuel, but you cant run 50+ laps."
I'm quite sure that gen4 has smaller fuel thank it was in IRL when gen4 was racing.
"Pardon my dumb question, aren't the Gen 4 & ARCA cars basically the same?"
They use the same body.  But the Gen 4 has a LOT more HP.
no
"F4 is so much fun, but damn the average driver standard is so low. Makes it hard to enjoy sometimes."
"F4 - Easier to catch and much more popular but does have some shitty drivers 
F3 - More rewarding, harder to drive and less activity but cleaner grids"
"I don’t know about the other regions but the F4 region I race in very clean and good atmosphere, especially when it’s at a non-subscription included track. 

I like that it’s only 2 days a week so I can get in some practice on Tuesday, race Wednesday Thursday.

I would so strongly consider the FF1600 trophy. It’s really great racing, and the jack ass dirty  hotlappers and wannabe ‘next Max Verstappens’ give it miss because they think it’s beneath them."
"F4 is really fun to drive, but is pretty carnage filled. My race finishes are either top 5, or 15+. Ff1600 is way cleaner for example.

I plan on trying f3 after I get my C license. I've driven the car a few practice sessions and it definitely has more power haha."
You’ve gotta learn to love the chaos. Otherwise it can be very unpleasant.
Thank you! :)
"Race what you want there are no rules.
Checkout other disciplines before blowing cash if you're bored. Variety is the spice of life"
"Race whatever is fun for you, but focusing on a series/car for a full season or longer is really beneficial."
"This goes against a lot of advice but figure out what you want to race long term and fast track it to that series. Is it GT3, F4, something else?"
"When you feel like driving another car, as simple as that"
You don't need to stop racing the Vee ever if you enjoy it. Lots of high license and high IR still race the rookie series because they are fun and require a short time commitment.
"When you want, it's a game dude!

I had casually B license after 3 weeks of iracing, race what you like!"
"It’s not a “rookie series”, it’s a series which has a minimum license of rookie to participate in. As you get better you move up the splits. Today I raced in a 3.4k top split with some excellent drivers. Race in any series you enjoy. The wheel to wheel racing in the Vee is rarely matched in any other open wheel series. 

If you’re enjoying the Vee then stick with it and move up to top split. It will massively improve your racecraft."
"Yea I'm new on iracing also. I still race MX5 and Formula 1600, just got my first GT4 and some tracks. Ready for the GT4 life =)"
"I've been racing the Vee and FF1600 for two seasons. My iRating hovers around 1400. I can keep up with all but the aliens in the tip split. My issue is consistency. This season I've been working on how to pull it back just enough so that I can go fast but not lose it. 


It's also forced me to get better at seeing wrecks well before they happen. So I'm not fighting idiots that driving recklessly anymore. I've started taking more defensive lines while braking a hair later which usually causes the reckless driver to lock up and miss the corner since they're following my lead.


I'm probably going to continue racing the Vee forever. I just love that thing I just won't invest any time into it. I've been thinking about jumping to a GT series or F3 next season but I'm having fun now. The racing is good in the top splits and anyone who talks about ""escaping rookies"" is a bad driver. "
"Whenever you want. 

I have an A class road license and still race rookies all the time. They’re fun! And I love the FF1600. 

If you really enjoy Formula Vee you could give USF2000 a try. Faster car with some downforce and significantly more grip. Plus you get some ovals in the mix which don’t require an oval license but do count TOWARDS your oval license. 

But ultimately it’s up to you. Race what’s fun for you."
I myself wanted to race some of the stuff in C so I got through rookies in races then fast tracked through D. At the end of the day (don’t kill me) it’s just a game. Have fun.

He mumbled “Malcolm in the Middle” as he drove through the gap.
"Malcolm was, indeed, in the middle"
Heard rumors he might be doing some truck/xfinity races this year
The trucks during this time sometimes had Cup engines in them. I think Frankie had the one that Dale Jr had in the 2001 Pepsi 400.
How many people will wreck him just so they can brag to their friends that they crashed into a celebrity?
That was a ballsy move
I mean of course he goes on to win the race. It looks like everybody else was wiped out.
"I, too, raced Frankie but in Arca at Kentucky. Outqualified him and ended up winning the race. I think he finished P7 or somewhere around there."
Track?

All in all that’s awesome.  Malcom in the middle was a huge part of my childhood growing up."
"Was in this race with you!! Only out-qualified him by .005, but getting to do the formation lap next to him felt awesome lol! I watched that wreck back right after, and he was about 6 inches from getting clipped"

This joke was made in the last thread. Now we have proof. Put it in the louvre
Literally.
He used to always race in the celebrity stuff at Long Beach GP. This is going back like even 10 years ago.
"A lot of people didn’t seem to know and those around him were very respectful, I finished right behind them with some damage from this wreck. Couldn’t keep up so i was bummed I wasn’t in the mix. But who knows how other lobbies act."
I once got into a wreck with Lando Norris during the last Indy 500. I felt like it was my fault but he took the blame.
He wasn’t even in the race according to iracing
Someone mentioned that he’s practicing for potentially doing the truck series next season!
Daytona legacy 2008 Silverado unranked
"When I go to your recent raced the draft master race doesn’t seem to have Frankie Muniz in it, was this a glitch or something?

Nevermind, it was unofficial race meaning im stupid because it was an open lobby or league."
He was full time ARCA last year.
I'd like to think people get used to him or other celebrities in their splits after awhile.
"It’s an unranked race in the  2008  Silverado. No effect on series, win, safety or skill points. Just for fun. Someone mentioned he may be trying it out for the truck series he wants to participate in irl."
I thought he was going full time in xfinity as well? May have misread that. Good for him. Heard he was somewhat successful in ARCA.
“Life is unfair”
This. Once you have them repeatedly you get used to it. I raced with Alex Palo a few times. Dudes clean as fuck online and really nice to fans in lobbies

"I just started learning it last night! I'm in.

MST time zone. 1000 iR"
Hello mate what’s your IR? And what time zone are you? :)
1k MST
Maybe you should post your Tz in the description instead of asking each person who responds
You're definitely closing the sim and restarting it after every change in the file?
"Mine did the same thing recently, I basically renamed every single other RendererDX11 file and put a “.old” on the end of them.  I don’t race in VR anymore or anything but monitor, so just took them all out of play except the monitor file.  Now it works fine."
Don't worry about in sim settings if you are doing the edit ini file for borderless windowed.  Just put in the correct resolution and change border to 0 and fullscreen to 0.
"Had the same issue recently when setting up triple monitor setup, changing .ini file didn't work, but when I used [irSidekick Profiles](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/irsidekick-profiles-free.62118/) app, it worked. Not sure what was the issue, but this app solved it. It may be worth a shot for you."
Yes. Not sure I closed the launcher every time. But did that a few times as well for sure.
"What do you mean by ""other RendererDX11 files"". You mean from other games in other folders? Surely it could only be the one in the iracing folder?"
"That is what I have done, but for some reason it still opens in full screen on a different monitor (my main monitor that is not on my rig, but next to it)"
"Nah it's fine not closing the launcher. Can't think of anything else sorry.
Can you change some things in the graphic settings and check the file is different? Just to make sure you're changing the right file."
"It's been a minute since I had to reset mine but iirc you need to 

1 Make sure the monitors are labeled correctly and ordered correctly on the desk.  

2  The one setting that determines where the Left side of the  trips is either -1920 or 1920 (for 1080p monitors) to properly align it starting with left side.  Can't remember exactly not at my rig atm."
"I have done that as well, but the sim seems to think that the file is still set to full screen and on a different monitor.

There is no correlation between the file and what the sim does."
That's strange.  Maybe disconnect the offending monitor and re-run graphic config then reset the ini file.  Screenshot graphics settings so you can put them back quickly.  Reconnect offending monitor after all that.  Only guess I've got.  Hope you get it sorted.

I could not stop looking at the cursor left on screen.
"Turn that virtual mirror off, you monster."
Man I’m surprised you don’t seem mad at that guy. You gave him plenty of space for a fairly aggressive move and he just carelessly squeezed you off the track trying to open up a corner he wasn’t going to take optimally anyway. 
"Man, no one likes trimming their clips."
"I had it from the other side in VR a few days ago, just see the underside of a car above me. That was a weird look."
"I had an indycar crash where it used to spin like a top, in vr once.

I think that was the only time i almost threw up in vr."
What car is this?
The virtual rear view mirror looks ridiculous in VR.
Love how the lollipop man was like: Dude wake up! It was all just a bad dream.
"“Hey, you, you’re finally awake”"
Reason no.1 why I don't use VR- would projectile vomit 100%.
I love how the game is like nah don't burn up his GPU just put him back.
"This may be kind of off-topic, but Jesus Christ iRacing, what the hell are those in-car mirrors? The FOV is so small it’s pretty much completely useless even on a flat screen. I have no idea how or why in the flying fluck they haven’t implemented a mirror FOV-adjuster, like they have for the virtual mirror. They’re almost there, you can adjust the angle they point in, and you can see a little more using that, but we really need wider FOV. Just pretty stupid imo."
"Ah yes, Mark Webber simulator"
Mugello is so fun in this car.
Not really once your used to it it's nothing at all just another day in the park lol
What software did you use to record the VR so smoothly?
What are your pc specs?
"So jealous of your quality, I used the Meta Quest 2 but it always felt like I’m seeing things in 720p"

I didn't even have problems running it on a gtx 1080
"Running it on a 1060 3gb, mugello sometimes runs fine but most of the time drops half the frames"
Have done msfs but vtol vr does look very tempting. and much easier to run than msfs

return to pits speedrun any%
"Do that at Summit Point. Drive off into the trees, and you’ll fall off into the abyss and be reset back in the pits."
Its great to have as a general awareness tool. The incar mirrors arent super high fov so theres a ton of blind spots.
Its lap 1 shit happens. Ive raced the same guy other times before and know its most likely just a genuine mistake. I wasnt even beside him going into that.
"I think I disagree completely actually. The car in front is fully entitled to the racing line, and there was only an accident because the front car braked earlier than OP was expecting. Running into the back of someone under braking is pretty much always the car in the back's fault at worst, or a racing incident at best.

If OP was actually alongside when the front car moved right, different story completely, but they weren't."

"5800x3d, 32gb ram, rtx 3080. Running reverb G2 with openxr toolkit ffr."
From my experience the quest link just has compression that just allways is there that fucks the visual quality. the quest 2 is fine in standalone cause the display hardware itself isnt the issue but the usb/wifi link compared to pcvr with an actual displayport cable is just what it is. Tried a quest 3 in hopes i could replace my G2 and get rid of the wmr platform but even with cranked out airlink on wifi 6 there was allways some level of compression. And the cable is just worse cause they never updated it to fully take advantage of the quest 3
What headset do you run?
"Looking into either triples or VR setup, I wear glasses. Would triples be less strain on the eyes?"
"Hell I only have a 2080Ti and a quest 3. I never had any issues with Iracing. Only issue I have is that the airlink is a bit shit in Quest 3 so sometimes I get a bit of a lag but thats an Airlink issue. Using a cable is just butter smooth but unfortunately due to some bug, quest 3 drains more charge than it charges when using a cable.(also limitations on USB 3's max power output)"
"I run it no problem on a 2060 super. It's a really fun game. It's not as complex as DCS but don't expect to treat it like flying jets in something like battlefield. I've played with a few friends who had trouble getting the hang of the more realistic flight models and weapons systems. 

The game strikes a good balance between realism and approachability."

Meh I didn’t mind.
I liked the context of it being the 1st lap
"BuT iMmErSiOn 

Lol seriously though, I get it."
"No, it’s just simply because the car in front moved too close to the braking zone. A dangerous move that often leads to this kind of incident. Probably a racing incident but this one is much more 50/50 than you make it seem. Don’t go defensive just to move over right as you enter braking zone."
"100% this, FIA rulebook states:

> 20.3 More than one change of direction to defend a position is not  permitted. Any driver moving back towards the racing line, having  earlier defended his position off-line, should leave at least one car  width between his own car and the edge of the track on the approach to  the corner. 

The purple one didn't change his line anytime after he went out of T1, he wasn't ""defending"". He went with his line and changed direction just 1 time just before braking (and to be honest he also left a whole car space to his right since curbs does count). That's the only official rule about it, there is also the one that obliges you to leave a space for one car if someone puts half of his car on the side of yours but that only applies if the other car get to your side ***in the straight***. You can't put your nose on the side of the car ahead in the braking zone and expect space, you will be pushed out, and that happens every single time in real races too. Sadly there is a lot of confusion about these matters and you can tell even just reading the comments here. I think iRacing (but also FIA) should do a structured video that explains the overtaking rules and make it mandatory to watch before racing, it could be really helpful for the racing standards in the service."
Thanks!!

"Triples would 100% be less strain on the eyes. Part of the reason I got triples, impossible to wear that headset for more than an hour comfortably"
Triples prob gonna be easier but i know theres perscription lens inserts to a lot of vr headsets available. i have glasses for far vision but can wear vr fine without glasses. i feel vr is more problem for near vision problems than far vision problems.
I have done a 5 hour stint at Le Mans in VR... would not recommend. Monitors are FAR more comfortable
"I wear glasses too and my prescription is on the higher side.(-10). I wear contact lenses and use the headset. it works like charm. Only issue is, over time, my lenses would get a bit dry so I have to lubricate them every couple of hours which is actually way too often compared to IRL where I can go on for a whole day even riding my motorcycle for 400-500kms"
"If you want to improve the delay with Airlink, consider getting the PrismXR puppis router. Broadcasts wifi at 5GHz so it's a much faster response, MUCH better than normal airlink connection"
">quest 3 drains more charge than it charges when using a cable.(also limitations on USB 3's max power output)

It's not like that, it's a thermal issue. When you charge up the battery you warm it and during usage quest 3 became quite hot by itself so for safety reason the charging will be throttled down so you will have a slowly discharge. I saw it keep the 100% charge when it's a bit colder in the room. Anyway i didn't go lower than 87/86% in use even in hotter days both using cable link (a powered one connected to a proper 18W charger of course not only to pc mobo) or virtual desktop wirelessly connected to a power bank.

A trick you could try is to make it lose few % of charge and then disconnect and reconnect the cable (not while racing if you are using cable link for data 😂) to force it re-negotiate the power delivery, sometimes it go back into charging. Shouldn't be an issue for any non-endurance race anyway, in worse case scenario the show-discharge i saw would still have let me race for like 5.5/6 hours nonstop."
Yeah DCS lite is what ive understood it as and its why it looks nice. DCS was way too wack to learn without investing a ton of time into it what turned me off of it.
I was looking up the whole time expecting an actual airplane crash 😭😭😭
None of us did.
Honestly in vr it blends in really well to the point i barely notice it unless im looking at it
I can’t even talk about immersion cause I have three overlays all around the virtual mirror
"This is also how I see it. Car in front is on the inside, leaving space for a car on the outside but decides to close it up in the braking zone. Even if he was entitled to the space (which I disagree with), it's incredibly likely that it's going to result in contact."
"Personally no issues with eye strain in vr, even soloing 4 hour NEC races."
What strap are you using? I would say use a hard helmet like strap like the BoboVR(for q2) which actually equally distribute the weight around your head Unlike the default straps which puts them on your face which makes you fatigue over time. Also try to use good quality silicon pads for your face so you don't sweat too much. Also make sure you clean your headset thoroughly before using. Sometimes i leave it unused for a week and there is some slight dust which can create some sneezing/watery eye etc.
"I tried something similar to this. I mean not the prismXR puppis router but my setup now is. 

from outside fiber cable comes into my apartment-> from there RJ45 -> into my main 1Gbps Tp-link router -> from there wired connection to my room router 1gbps D-Link router -> from there, again wired to -> my PC.

the quest is connected to the inroom router's wifi at 5Ghz.  


it actually does made my bandwidth better but im not sure if its my router or quest 3 or just my home(maybe some interference), but id get good bandwidths but then there will be a 100ms drop in bandwidth and then itll recover. it won't make much difference in slower cars but when im driving anything above 250kph, it gives a slight lag which actually can fuck up my entire race especially driving wheel to wheel

&#x200B;

not to mention im from India, so i already have 200 ping with iracing servers :\\  
looks like the PrismXR is not available in India. I'll try to see if someone i know can bring it up when they come from US. Will try this."
"oh no it doesn't happen when i use power bank. so i use a fast charging 27000 mAh powerbank and i never have this issue. i only have it with cable. I think what you say is right too because when i connect the cable, i set my bitrate to > 500mbps so probably i work the quest way too much and hence it gets heated as compared to airlink where its only at 200mbps(anything above that is uplayable for me)  


  
also what do you mean by

> Anyway i didn't go lower than 87/86% in use even in hotter days both using cable link (a powered one connected to a proper 18W charger of course not only to pc mobo)  

how can u cable link as well as connect it to a powered charger?"
"Heh DCS lite, that's perfect. 

I will say they just release an update and DLC that added electronic counter measures and a new Jet. Part of the update was also a change to how the radar systems work. Both of which did ramp up the complexity to a certain degree. But still not as involved as DCS. If you're like me, you like the idea of DCS, but don't have the patience for it. Then , just buy it right now I promise you won't regret it."
I'm just one of those VR people that would use a helmet view of iracing had it because I want to be as immersed as possible. It's a sickness and has caused me to spend an insane amount of money on my rig.
"uhh!! they are HUDs in your helmet. duh!! 

or that's what I tell myself"
"I've tried nearly every type of strap throughout my VR career, definitely way better than the original strap. Don't know why they ever made it that way to begin with. I had the silicon pads, but ended up taking them off because I feel like they made me sweat more. I like the original cloth feeling better. I just can't stand something on my face for hours on end, it gets itchy and when you're on an endurance race, you really can't just take it off and adjust. 

I still use for VR, just not for longer races."
"That's real unfortunate about your ping in iRacing, that would be so bothersome for me. I feel if your current set up is broadcasting 5Ghz, there wouldn't be much of a different switching to the prismXR. I could be wrong though."
"I have a cable that doesn’t connect Only to pc but it splits and take the data from pc and the power from the wall charger. It’s this one: [https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0C4H13HQH](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0C4H13HQH)

It works but i Can confirm that even with this sometimes my quest 3 slowly discharges, if I connect it to a power bank and use virtual desktop to connect to the pc it stays always at 100%. Probably You guessed right with the bandwidth thing, i’ll test the cabled connection with the same bandwidth of the VD connection to see if it really matters."
"VR Headsets already have a FOV way smaller than a helmet. Snell has required helmets to have 180 degrees FOV for over a decade. [Here's FIA's rules from 2018, check page 13](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/8860-2018_advanced_helmet_0.pdf)"
what's an helmet view? I thought only ACC had it and iracing didnt
"interesting. I guess it depends on each person's skin. The cloth always felt itchy to me. like sitting naked on a cloth sofa for a long time if you know what I mean.  


on a different note, what else do you play in VR other than simracing?"
"I know this

VR vertical fov is wider tho"
"Haha yes, I definitely know the feeling. I guess I prefer that to the stickiness of the silicon once you start sweating.

I play DCS and Vtol, but mostly just racing sims. If you have any recommendations, I'll gladly take them"
"I don't understand why you would limit your FOV with a helmet filter when it's already limited by the headset? To each his own, I guess."
">VR vertical fov is wider tho

you could do fov shrinking for vertical to simulate that and gain a lot of performance (try something like 0.7/0.8 to begin then adjust to your liking)."
"If u like flying, star wars squadrons is a great pick. I also use it for work. I work as a software dev and I used immersed and use it for work. sometimes i hop into some public lobby and just chat with other devs around the world while we work."
"Because immersion.

I already said this"
I get that you want immersion. I just don't get how limiting your FOV even more adds to the immersion. I would think having more of your view filled up by the VR world would be more immersive. Companies like Pimax market their higher FOV as being more immersive. When I'm driving in VR I already feel like I'm looking through a set of 0x binoculars and can't see anywhere near as much as when I'm wearing my helmet irl.
"Spa is often a really tricky track at low splits. You get a lot of straight line speed on that first lap with cold tires plus there’s such a long opportunity for a slipstream and the troglodytes that unfortunately populate these series so often interpret the slipstream as proof of their raw pace and think they don’t need to bother braking or worrying about the car in front. And because they’ve memorized the braking point someone on YouTube told them to brake at; they have no concept that with cold tires, dirty air, and the momentum of being a bit faster due to the slipstream; that might be too late of a braking point. 

It’s ALSO possible that while it doesn’t make it your fault per se; you don’t quite have the pace yet at that track and as a result are braking a lot later than other drivers expect. 

All of that to say; the best answer is use this for learning. Learn to avoid this stuff. Learn to adapt your line. Learn to move out of the way and let them come careening off into the grass. I know that’s frustrating advice to hear but it’s the advice I got and when it finally started to “click” it made racing a lot more fun for me. 

And, well, you could try a better series. At low splits especially, F4 and F3 tend to just be a little… rough at times. I find USF2000 and IndyPro to be a much much better racing community. None are perfect, but that one’s much better. 

And I don’t mean any offense by this *at all* but; lots of people do get through F4 and F3 just fine without wrecks. They’ve honed those defensive skills and that situational awareness and they’re able to mostly avoid the idiots. Food for thought. 

And finally, this isn’t world of Warcraft. The goal isn’t to level up and progress to the next car. The goal is to have fun, race, get better, and maybe win some races. Don’t feel pressured to “move up” into classes you don’t like just because they’re a higher license class. Heck as an A class myself I very rarely venture out of D/C class races and I even race the occasionally rookie series. I just find them to be more fun."
"We all been there. Until you learn to survive you will stick under 1500. You moved aggressively to c class and open wheel. Sounds like you are in the f3? Fast car, takes some time to learn. Bottom split and spa are both nightmares for safety. Open wheels tougher than gt3 in the sense you can door bang in one and the other leads to many gentle net code deaths. It’s part of the journey, and really, it’s the most fun part. Adjust your mindset and take it as a challenge to conquer. It’s all part of making you a better racer."
Qualify ahead of the mess and work on some car body language to wrecks. Braking off line can help avoid a noob that would have crashed into you
"I pay attention during practice to see how predictably everyone is driving. If they don't seem great, I tend to go wider on turn one or let people get a bit ahead so I can avoid the carnage.


I really wish causing a major crash had more of a cost to people. Even if it is a mistake, they should be required to do some training against the AI and prove they can drive safely at their level before they can race again. "
"Yeah, after rookies I tried loads of GT4/GT3/F3 and my irating was crazy volatile, going from 1500 to 800, then back up to 1100 then down to 600 and repeat - BUT over that same time, my SR and ability to avoid wrecks got so much better. I really wouldn't focus on ratings too much - just finishing as clean as possible. The wins and podiums will follow pretty quickly with that mindset as you learn; who to avoid, when to battle, when to back off and when to just let someone past and watch them take out 3 over people and leap frog 3 positions- survival instinct is such a big part of racing as is being opportunistic.

iRacing is so much fun overall - the fun moments will far outweigh the bad ones pretty soon.

Hang in there!"
And yes… protest shitty rejoins.
"Formula fords are very different cars than gt3. Very light weight and sensitive to your inputs. so take it easier and you wont spin out.

You can get a lot of lap time in the formula ford by braking lightly and very early, but then going full throttle way before you even come close to the apex on the exit."
"sims like iracing are realistic with physics. a formula ford is entirely different to a gt3 irl, so this is the same in the sim. so yeah, you have to learn how to drive it differently to how you’d drive a gt3.

being fast in any car starts with first understanding how the car drives and what its characteristics are. if you drive every car in the same way, you will never be fast in anything"
"As for the car spinning, its a very light car witg engine in the rear. As soon as you lift off throttle while turning, the weight comes off the rear tyres in a major way, and because the fronts get weight added on to them the car just loses the rear. 

This would be compounded by the fact you jump onto the brakes at this point too, further increasing the weight on the fronts, and as such the grip. Itll spin you out faster. 

Personally I like to get on the throttle early and try feather the throttle to use a little bit of this effect to help with my rotation"
"You have abs and tc in gt3 cars my friend.

FF don’t have this so you need to perfect throttle and brake modulation.

ACC requires you to slam the brakes at 100%. This won’t work in a FF.

Spinning is almost always too much entry speed for your skill level.

Smooth in fast out."
iracing starts you with cold tires.  ACC pre-warms the tires for you IIRC.
"Make sure your pedals are calibrated correctly both in game and with any software they come with.

You can test them in game in the options screen by slowly depressing the pedal, until you hit the end of the pedal travel. If the input line doesn't match where the pedal is at, eg the input line is at 100% but the pedal is only at 50% input, this is what will be causing your issues.

ACC could've been covering up your pedal issue because GT3s have TC and ABS"
"Read up or watch some videos on oversteer and understeer: this is the source of spinning out or not being able to corner sharp enough.

Short versionn: oversteer = too much steering/more steering in the front (ex: you start to steer into a corner and the rear spins out because the fronts oversteer past what the rears had grip for.)

Understeer = optimal grip is exceeded and you cannot gain anymore steering that you are currently at (ex: rears have more grip than front on a turn and you run wide because you couldnt gain anymore steering on the fronts)"
"This is just the nature of I-racing, you can't push too aggressively, not like in acc. The rear tires don't have the grip. It's my biggest complaint with Ice-racing lol.. Try taking turns in a higher gear for instance if you are dropping to 2nd try it in 3rd.  Slow in fast out. I've found that some tracks you don't even need to shift, you can stay in 3rd gear with the 1600. The trick to catching a slide is to not brake but use a little bit of throttle. Turn in to the slide but be ready to catch it coming back the other way."
Dm me and I can help you out whenever.
"Start with your body and hands position. There are many good charts on what your position should look and feel like. For me it helps to remember to be relaxed and firm. 

Try watching an onboard video of that car on that track. You will pick up the shifting rhythm easier that way. 

Run hot laps with that car until you can be consistent. Try to get 20 laps in within .75 of each other."
We all start like this.  It just takes time and practice.  You can clearly feel the speed like you can in a real car but if you take a real MX5 and drive it 80mph around a sharp curve you would also go off the track...  Eventually you start to feel the speed accurately.  Also start off by only braking on a straight line before the corner.  Once you master that then you can do what is called trail braking.  Search youtube.  Trail braking is especially hard if you don't have a load cell pedal although many fast guys master it on a low cost logitech.  Ideally find a faster friend or make a friend to drive with.  Otherwise watch Suello Almeda on youtube or take his course.  Race simulation is very hard in the beginning but boy does it get amazingly fun when you get a bit better.
When I joined in 2010 the first thing I did was go into a practice at Laguna in the Solstice and just kept spinning out forever
Buy Porsche cup and drive around random tracks. It will help you to improve the right braking because it is the car that has the hardest braking style
"Yeah, when you feel the back end slipping, give it some throttle and it will transfer weight to the rear and regrip."
Slow in fast out/fast in backwards out
I’ll take a look at it when I get back home. How big of a difference does a load cell brake make?
I’ll give a try. I got dq’d in my first race because I got too many incidents lol I wasn’t aware that track limits count as incidents.
"You've got the right idea but there's an important thing with cars like the ff1600, mx5 and srf. They have an open differential. An open diff is very loose off throttle and tends to be tight on throttle. 

Shifting the weight is an important effect but the ff1600 has even more reasons to implement the technique you reference."
"Load cells will make braking easier as you can build up the muscle memory up and it'll pick up the finer inputs to make trail braking easier.

But if the max/min settings are off then it'll make using them harder because you'll either never get near the max pressure or you'll be hitting it really early from little pressure.

If you've got fanatec pedals, make sure you look into BRF setting as that will also effect how much braking force you use and if it's too high or low it will also mean you'll reach the max input too early or not at all.

Once you're confident your pedals are calibrated and set up properly, then it's worth going through the other comments here about techniques because that's what you'll need to start practicing and doing to find where you're going wrong."
Great point! Appreciate the additional info
When you have mapped a button or rotary to increase/decrease values in the black box you can also adjust the ffb strength. I usually use auto and use the rotary to fine-tune the ffb
You can try switching it to Nm instead of strength (click the strength label in options) to see if Nm gives you better granularity.
"Pretty sure you can't change the value incrementally via a button or mapping, but you can set it to align to Auto. You need to map this in the controls."
"I use it also, but it increases in 0.5 steps, which makes a big difference, between two positions."
This is what I do and it works well enough
Sadly but in nm steps are same
"Everything has a priority. 

Virtual fuel tank IMO is more relevant for LMH spec which allows non-hybrid cars where LMDh has a mandatory (and spec) hybrid so while the current system isn't correct, it's also not unfair like it would be IRL. 

I imagine we'll get it at some point "
I just want a gtp car that does the bump fire in the game. Lol
"I dont know if the virtual fuel tank gets too complex or broken with different race length and fixed setup, we dont have a pre programmed too and most likely never get the ability to program that"
What
"I know they’ve posted videos on that one, I think they are trying to get the code right so it doesn’t fuck up and make us run a whole lap on battery only lol"
The Cadillac LMDh wasn't using the battery to leave the pits in the Daytona 24 for some reason. Commentary said that it could be due to getting a better launch to spin the rear tires up more.
What
"Real Life GTP hybrid doesn’t *add* power like it does in iracing. It only replaces power from the ICU. They also have a virtual fuel tank so they pit long before the fuel tank is actually empty.
Edit: if I’m wrong, someone please just tell me I’m wrong but this is how I understood the GTP hybrid to work since they never talk about fuel stints but “energy stints” and the telemetry says “energy remaining”"
Lmp2 is fun but it’s kind of old. Been using the same one for ever now.
I read they haven’t fixed or made the bump start for it. But idk. I haven’t run them. I just learned they even came out with it haha
You're correct except the part about pitting long before the actual tank is empty. I would be shocked if they were dragging around a bunch of extra fuel weight all race.
"I think you're a little mistaken. 
The virtual energy it's more to account for the amount of energy the hypercars use so they probably have less fuel tank size to get the same energy than lmdh. 

Also as the  units are different they probably also have different fuel usage, so that way it's all equalized."
"Yeah but IIRC, LMP2 is dying IRL anyway. And iracing isn’t even on the main LMP2 chassis"
"Oh, seems they came out with the Cadillac a lil while back. Didnt even know lol."
"Yeah it doesn't do electric starts in iRacing, but I thought it was funny that the Cadillac wasn't doing it IRL either. Pure V8 launches."
"But the hybrid doesn’t actually add power, right? It just replaces power from the ICU? What you say about the virtual energy makes sense too"
"Well Lmp2 has only been moved out of WEC, meanwhile IMSA, AsLMS and ELMS still have an LMP2 class, it will also feature in the 24h of Le Mans this year. It is far from dying with many teams still racing in the class."
"It's out of WEC but it's not really dying. ELMS and AsLMS have a lot of entries and IMSA numbers are all right, and there will be a new LMP2 generation in 2025 I believe. I hope iRacing scans it."
Funnily enough our LMP2 is actually the underpinnings of some GTP cars
I’m not sure how the newer power rules work but maybe it was a loophole or something and they could save more energy by not using it. Or maybe just because the race was so long they allowed them not to use it for energy purposes. I would “assume” the electric start would drain it at least a little. Just speculating though.
"I think it does. At least for the hypercars I know for sure than Toyota was boped around the minimum speed they could use the electric motors. 

I don't really know why you think it works that way, haven't heard or read anything about not adding power all last season.



Only thing in that way it's that the maximum power output of the cars, thermal and electric combined it's capped at certain value. 

But I think they use the electric motors to give energy while the thermal motor it's on low revs. That way they compliment the power curve with the electric motors that offer that power instantly. 



Tldr they use the electric motors to get more acceleration on low revs."
"Really? That’s crazy! What GTP uses the Ligier as a base?
Edit: fucked up my LMP2/3, LMP2 is dallara"
"Edit. 
Check this video
https://youtu.be/O245IDby_pU?si=qOZjea9OoCZj3bfS
It offers information"
The IRacing lmp2 is the Dallara. They build the bmw and caddy gtp
"We have the Dallara. 

The LMP3 is Ligier. "
"So far only Lamborghini. Though the lmdh chassis are not the same as current LMP2 but rather a planned next generation that has evolved into Lmdh.

The dallara Chassis gets used by Cadillac and BMW, Oreca by Acura and Alpine and Multimatic by Porsche."

I mean like the time and standings on the top of your screen haha
Streaming. I’ve been iRacing on it for months. I just can’t get both eyes to stream. I use OpenXR (PimaxXR)
i love the Pimax 8kx but it prob suits my IPD 71.4 cant go away from large FOV now
thats racelabs
Oh ok. I was looking at saving for the pimax but I know it’s super expensive. Do you think a 3060 could run it ok?
Thanks!
I'd say go for a 2nd hand one or maybe the 5k+ super 3060 will be okay med/low at 60fps on 8kx easy on 5k+
Ok. I’ll have to keep researching but I appreciate your help!

"What in the hell, I've never seen an actual pitcrew before. Is this only on ovals?"
Like a glove
yes
I wonder why. Why not add this in road racing as well
"The guy hit the wall hard, and I saw his bent wheel as I got back on track. Had to regain 1st from someone else afterward but seeing his bent ass wheel made it all okay."
Idk why people want to race like that. 2nd is still better than last or a dnf. Good job on the win
"My first Spa 24 was terrible. I did four stints, was the slowest guy, spun myself a couple times, had the most incident points, got penalties leaving pit road twice. 

Reluctantly was drafted into a lineup the next year. Did eight stints, was the fastest guy, zero mistakes, most laps, and fewest incident points. It felt really good. And was really a key race in my progression as a driver in the game."
Dive bombed the leader in the final chicane of the Nurgurgring on the last lap. I didn't race for six months then.
I'm proud of every race where I have no incidents and place where I should. Getting 10th in top split feels great when I've been consistent I know that's the best I could do.
"I got my first win at Lime Rock in the IndyPro last week. 

It was a lot of luck and a little skill. I had worked really hard on that truck and got my laptimes up there with the quicker drivers. I qualified 4th. (Part of the luck was it actually splitting which doesn’t often happen, so the aliens were elsewhere). Got a better start than P3 and got around him before the first corner. 

Then into the first corner, P1 and P2 collided and I braked and went to the outside. 3 other cars tried to go inside to not lose position and they all got tangled up. 

So then I found myself around the wreck on the outside, and by the end of that lap, in the lead by several seconds. 

I pretty much matched the pace of P2 for the entire 30 minute race and finished P1 about 7 seconds ahead. 

So there was definitely some luck; but I feel proud of myself because I capitalized on the luck, avoided the big crash, and put in competitive laps. It was one of those races where I made no mistakes and was thoroughly rewarded."
"Daytona 24 last year.

"It’s very satisfying when someone behind pits way early because they think I’m holding them up, then after I pit, they are still behind me.

Also any 0x race is really satisfying, especially if it’s a good result."
"LMP2, IMSA at Suzuka. I pit early to avoid traffic, came out P4 and held off 3 faster drivers behind me for 15 minutes to hang on.

LMP2, IMSA Enduro at Homestead. I was a lap down when I got in the car and won the race. I was racing in a lower split than I should have been because of the average iRating rule and my teammate but I still enjoyed that one."
Nords 24 win in class (GT4) was intense.
"Daytona 24 this year, after taking a break from the game last year and not finding a team for GTP I decided to race in LMP2 with a friend, but I got very sick the week before and couldn’t start preparing until 2 days before the race. 

Ended up in top split with 8k SOF and 20 hours into the race we were only 8s behind the leader with a shot at the win, and a pretty much confirmed P2 with a gap of a full minute behind. Finally DNF’d because my wheelbase turned off while I was driving, but still it was really satisfying knowing we managed to compete for a win as a 2 man team in such a big event (even considering LMP2 is the weakest field)."
Legacy silverstone in the SRF back when I first joined. tough car
Last TCR race. 2.5k SoF & finished 3rd only a few seconds behind two drivers with over 6k ir. Doesn’t sound like much but I finally feel like I can compete with those guys now
"I’m in the same boat as you almost. Ran IMSA at the Nord 3 times between yesterday and today. Finished P3, P2, and P3 for a total of 193 irating and maxed safety at 4.99. I was pretty nervous going into the races but luckily I qualified well earlier in the week so started top 8 all 3 races. Only issues I had was being pit maneuvered in T2 on my last race, had to work through some gt3 cars and back through the gtp’s.  But this is the most proud of my racing I have been since starting iRacing. Been on less than a year."
"My very first Daytona24 in 2023, we weren't really competing for anything, it was a GT3-only split, we had incidents and repairs, ended up P28 many laps behind the leader but I managed to do 4 clean stints with only 7x off tracks in over 115 laps. It was the first endurance event with my team and I felt really proud of my performance.

I have 6 solo wins in 230 races and, although I'm happy I managed to win that many times, they have all either been in races where the top drivers took themselves out early on or after very close battles where I only managed to overtake towards the end because of opponent's mistake. A win is a win, yes, but I am yet to collect a solo win where I am clearly the best/fastest on track. My largest win margin is still under 5s."
2020 Brickyard 400 on NiS. Started down the order because i messed up my qualy laps and ended up winning a cautionless race on pure speed and good strategy. And it was the 3rd split.
"I won the bottom split of spec racer Ford earlier in the week. Winning wasn't what I was most proud of. 

The reason I won is not because I was the fastest. It was because I didn't fuck up. Not the whole race. 

Ok well technically there was an incident on the first lap. But I didn't screw anything else up the whole rest of the race. 

THAT was so great. It was such a good feeling. A sky rocket in SR and iR wasn't terrible either."
"my first win. in street stock at usa international this week. i wasnt the fastest or most consistent. but i did have a good qualifying and avoided trouble passing back markers, which took out the vehicles  in front pulling away."
I was doing an arca race at nashville fairgrounds and got bopped from behind on the 3rd lap. I then proceeded to battle back from 13th and passed the car that spun me for the lead on the final lap.
"I like pcup, I was up to like 2.4ir and 4.0sr to start the week. I ended up being the 16-22 car for the first 10 races. Its was a shit show, one race a guy spun at the start, I stopped but got creamed from behind, next race first lap a guy turns another guy in front of me, thought I had two freebies but one of them bounced off the wall and nailed me in the front wheel. I had 3 different races where a top 5 car went off on the first lap and then killed me flying back through. IR down to 1.9 sr down to 1.5. 

So I took a day off and just now I decided to try again. Car #3, started 4th. Managed my tires the first few laps while p1-3 drove off to a 4 second lead. Lap 5 p3 spins and I go by, lap 8 p1 had an issue and me and p2 got by. By now I’m .5 behind the now leader and I can see he is pressing, off tracks, missing braking points etc. With two to go he spins and I drove to a nice win. It wasn’t the greatest victory of all time but it showed me my race craft isn’t complete shit and that I can do well when the race isn’t full of donkeys. 

I’ve been running the HPD series too this week. Still learning that car, but it’s a blast to drive and the races are longer and have a pit stop, at least this week."
P16 to p1 in F3 Mugello. Most overtakes on track as well.
Any where u finish ahead of your car number.
I won the lotus 79 friday night primetime race broadcasted on racespot at nords last year. I knew I had pace but didn't expect to win. A really difficult race following and trying to keep in touch with two cars in front. I managed to follow them even with a few close calls almost losing the car. On the last lap the leader made a mistake under pressure and I eventually took the lead into the last corner on the last lap and won. Good times.
"I would be proud of today imsa endurance too, starting at 17th in gtp. I've managed 3rd place in the middle of the race, but right at the end, with 2 laps to go, I simply forgot where I was at the track and had a massive crash..."
Same situation but GT3 Imsa at Nords. 
The one that sticks out to me was winning my first ever Indycar race  (and I think my second win ever) at Watkins Glen starting from the rear of the pack.
"Daytona 24. Never gonna forget my first 2 hour stint, or voice chat karaoke at 3am. Loved it"
"I won my first top split F3 race last season on Belle Isle, a track that in the first few races I really struggled with. I qualified well thena  T2 incident caused the other front runners to take themselves out, but a high IR driver was starting from the back. half way through the race he caught me and I defended hard for 4 laps despite knowing just how much faster he was. He then went a bit too hot into a corner, pinballed off the outside wall and that speared him straight into the adjacent wall knocking him out of the race.

  
The best way to win a race is obviously by making good overtakes, but for me in this race I was never supposed to win and knowing that I won not because the guiy in front crashed but I defended well enough to cause a mistake felt like such an underdog moment"
"Although my team won our daytona24 GTP race…

C fixed trucks at Iowa years ago. Led a lot, got spun with like 5 to go. Dropped to around 15th. Gambled on 2 tires instead of the rest of the field taking 4, hung on to a GWC win."
"IMSA at Nurb GP, first season of the first LMP2 nerf. I qualified like sixth, and I thought everyone took off but the leader pulled his brakes before the line (protest yeah) but it caused me to pass him before the line and I had to serve a stop and go. Fuck.

However, as some know when they first nerfed the LMP2 they forgot to adjust max fuel, so you could single stint some races (Nurb, Long Beach) until they fixed it next season, but almost no one realized this.

 ...So I pitted as late as I could (lap 3) and ran in mostly open air for a while, combined with some fuel saving (you couldn't go balls out single stinting). Obviously I was dead last minus wrecks almost the whole race. No one in my split was single stinting, so as they all came in from 8 to 5 laps to go, I moved up quickly. Ended up getting a podium, much to everyone's bewilderment."
"I’ve had some wins that are near and dear to my heart but my favorite race was a few weeks ago at the Hockenheim Ring in the FF1600. Top split race and I managed to finish 5th by holding off a faster car for something like 15 laps running an ultra clean defensive line (always space for them to get alongside and potentially pass, just never where they’d really want it). They messaged me after to congratulate and thank me for the race, which felt particularly nice."
"Really any of my races from the full season I drove in the IMPC. Finished within top 5 with some podiums almost every week in top split. I feel like that season had such a huge positive effect on my driving abilities, especially consistency."
"I’m kinda proud my first clear win, but that was one of my most boring race ever."
"I done the 2pm (GMT) IMSA Enduro at The 'Ring in the Caddy GTP. Started P12 since I didn't qualify. Finished P5 though it really should have been P3 but I got a bit excited on cold tyres when I came out of the last pit stop.

I did use the safe VRS setup (Coz I hadn't done any practice) which had way too much wing. Even in the slipstream and in ATTACK mode I wasn't gaining on anyone, especially those in the Acura. That thing was a rocket in the straights.

Hands, arms and  wrists will be feeling it in the morning."
"Yeah, like you need to do every stupid mistake in one race. That race is hunting you for life...

And sometimes, when that race is coming back, you just turn off your brain and drive like a champion."
"Shit happened ... sometimes i dont want to race anymore. 3 weeks ago, i was at 1.8k ir, i had terrible terrible week of racing and felt at 1.1k with licence B... i felt so bad. 

And now, i'm back at 1.7k with 4.99 licence A.

Just believe in yourself"
"Congratz, sometimes you need that little luck to get that race.

When i ended up in your position with several seconds into leading, i just think too much and make a mistake."
"Oh yes, a good strategy who is working feels good.

Every time i want to be the smartass, the result is terrible. So now, i'm just following crew chief orders"
"Any Nords race are intense.

I wish to participe to next Nords 24, i have few friends who asked me to take a stint. I refuse cause i don't feel confident enough to not make mistake and ruining the team."
"oh ... what is your wheelbase ?

I will feel disgusted if something happening like that during such race.

When i had my T818, i had the same problem cause the usb 3.0 is rubbish from thrusmaster. I replaced it and now it's working like a charm."
"Oh yes, SRF is so hard to handle ... i need much more practice before race than any others cars .."
"Oh yes, everytime i'm racing into TCR, the race are so tight.

I feel TCR series are one of the most competitive into IRacing"
"Ah yes, i was speaking from the endurance race then 2h40 inside a gtp on the nord.

I did too some classic IMSA, a lot of shit show even before the start.

Congratz for your consistency."
"Surviving during endurance race, it's the only goal for me.

It's good to be the fastest guy on track but you need to finish it."
"You should try that pcup into VLN. You'll have a blast !

I like HPD but my split are always a shitshow, there are lot of misunderstanding between drivers especially on monza."
"Mugello rocks ! 
What a beautiful track we got this year.

I did a F3 too, got a top 5 but shiting myself all race"
Simple as that
"Oh yes, I was really lucky too .. i got 2 times gotting slowly into the wall. Got like 30 seconds repair each time.

Fortunately, ACURA is pretty solid.

I sometimes too losing focus after long race, i guess it's normal at our amateur level."
Being the hunted is always something special
"When you are rocking a serie, you stick with it.

That’s some painful variance

"a lot lot lot of people have those issues of confidence dude. the important thing is to team with folks who recognise that shit can happen sometimes, people on the team can only do their best, and if they're friends as you say im sure they'd understand. just practice doing full stints without crashing at your own pace, when you can do that with relative reliability then you're ready"
"Simagic Alpha Mini, I had used it for a couple of endurance races already and this was the first time anything like that happened. Very painful :/"
"It’s the best racing I’ve personally experienced on the platform. The cars aren’t for everyone, but once you get the hang of fwd the races are so much fun."

"As a rule Buy tracks more than cars. Get the big hitters used season after season. Spa, Daytona, nurbs that kind of place. It gives you best bang per buck."
"If I were you I’d prioritise adding tracks to my collection rather than more cars. Free tracks become rarer as you progress through license classes, and having a decent collection of cars is not much fun if you’ve got nowhere to race them.

You already enjoy the GR86, which you can use in 2 distinct series. You can switch between the 2 series depending on the tracks you own, and use your birthday money to fill in the blanks."
https://iracing-week-planner.tmo.lol/
"F4 is good fun but very messy in low iR. If you can manage some chaos, I’d say go for it."
"So you do have your C license? 

If you’ve been enjoying the GR86 and SRF I’d pick up the next track or two for either of those so you can keep that enjoyment up. 

If you’re looking specifically for something different I’d say grab a GT4 car (whichever, the BOP is pretty good) and Suzuka as that’ll get you the next two weeks of racing in the D Class and C Class GT4 series.  The C class GT4 series is 30 mins and since the D and C class run on the same track your practicing is pretty much two-for-one - only one track to learn in a week."
"With limited time I wouldn't think about doing different series with the intention of actively driving in each one. It's just too much time practicing and learning.


If it were me, I'd buy Nurb plus tracks in your favorite series.


Why the Nurb? It's long and complex and perfect for hot lapping at those random times you have to drive. As a dad I know that my window doesn't always align with the iRacing schedule. Killing 45 minutes at the 'ring is better than a 1,000 laps at Oulton park..."
"If you want a new car and you've been enjoying the GR86, I'd get a GT4 car."
"I've found buying a car for each series I want to run multiplies track value, if you have a gt3, gt4, and a F4 car you can run each of the popular tracks multiple times a season instead of a lot of tracks once if you only have one car. 

Still get the popular tracks first, but spreading out your car options helps give you ways to use tracks multiple weeks per season."
"Lol that's actually a great perspective on the ring!

I was kind of shying away from it because it seems like a huge time investment to learn at the same level as I'm learning other tracks. But this puts it in a completely different light."
"Agreed. The people who argue for a single car per season and all the tracks clearly do not drive gt4/lmp3 (I do like the variety of tracks, but the no duplicates, and choice of unpopular tracks is just too pricey). A small variety of cars and popular tracks will keep one happily racing all year."
"The ring is the perfect “dad” track. Can confirm. 

Also, there’s the C class “Ringmeister” series that runs a different car every week, always at the ring. Chances are high that you’ll get a car you own popping up every few weeks to race it on. Also, the track shows up for every road series. Even Indycar was there last week. The GP circuit and the Nordschliefe are different layouts that get used as well, so it’s a common sight in road series. 

Learning it takes time and patience. Just knocking out a few very slow laps (like driving a mountain road) here and there will do wonders for learning the circuit. But it is a nice fun mountain road drive in your favorite iracing race car, so not bad. 

Welcome to the service!! It’s a freaking blast as I’m sure you’ve found out lol"
"You need more frames for smoother viewing. Also sounds like you need more computer. Anything under 70 is immediately jarring to me on my G2. On my machine I can run with most everything on in high detail and keep it pegged at 90 fps. For Daytona night race I will turn off crowds and stands.

I've done the foveated rendering which seems to help because its not rendering the entire image where you can't quite see in full quality. At Detroit with 25 Indycars I was able to hold pretty well at 90fps.

My equipment is

i5 12600k

3070ti

32gb DDR4"
Are you using motion smoothing? If so turn it off
"I've found it!!!! Thanks everyone who tried to help, but I finally found the sweet spot for my machine ever!

By setting to original 90hz, it looks like that my iRacing was not getting in sync, trying higher refresh rates

https://preview.redd.it/t9nasvi4p9fc1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=c282eb6814d4fe6705c58235382c068f5c6b2c71

  
but after changing this on the file it got just perfect!! 60fps, with 60hz, is sooooo smooth.

ps.: to be clear, I changed at the same time to lock on 60fps on iRacing settings and lowered my resolution to 60% on SteamVR to achieve this, but I could guarantee that it was the combination of these settings who achieved this kind of perfection.

Now I can at least imagine what people with more powerful machines feels at 90fps 90hz."
"Yes, i know that but I can't have that at this point and I'm fine with it running at 58fps. What intrigues me it why I'm getting less frames just by changing it to a lower refresh rate.

11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400 @ 2.60GHz   2.59 GHz  
64gb DDR4  
3060 12gb non-TI"
"Thanks man, I already tried foveat rendering but didn't like the results. I've been running extensive tests in the last two years and I'm happy with 58fps as far as my money go. 

But had this idea to try 60hz and it was better on AC and I tried on iRacing..."
"No, it was already turned off. Thanks"
I would turn off any of the settings to make stuff pretty and focus on core functionality
Are you running through steamvr or openXR runtime? It really seems that you have motion smoothing on. Possibly in Steam or in WMR. Both should be off. If you are using open xr are you using the open XR toolkit?
Really appreciate but that's not what I'm looking for. I already tried that and found my nice sport. Looking specific for experiences with changing the WMR refresh rate.
"I've been running on Open XR toolkit in the past. But moved to SteamVR. I know that it is working that way because now Steam VR boots up when I start iRacing.

I'll take another look on this. Thanks"
"Yeah I highly recommend not using Steam VR with a reverb and Iracing. Set it to open xr in Iracing and use the open xr toolkit. It will look better and run better. Especially when you have a low end system.

Edit. Make sure that WMR is the open xr runtime, not Steam."
"Besides the possible protest for your rejoin (which he avoided because he has his car under control) there is actually no clean overtake. You left him no space on the outside because you went wide, because you again failed to hit the apex.

&#x200B;

Practice. More."
You’re proud of that?
Are you green?
Update: I have seen and read the comments and Ive realised the mistakes that I have made in this replay. I would like to take this opportunity as a learning point to improve my skills in iracing and become better at racing. Thank you everyone for your comments here 👍 Feel free to point out what else im able to improve on from this clip and I will take note for my future races.
"Dirty divebomb and going off track.  Ok.Also, OBS mate. It's 2024. No need to post potato recordings."
Why is no one talking about all the wind in this recording? Are you on the roof of your car? Little computer on the prairie per chance ?
"Yeah, that’s was a poor move. Hopefully you don’t do this again. You see dive bombs so often and it’s stupid."
yup i see that and i do need to practice more 😅 im a relative new player in iracing since i joined a month back and i will do my best to practice and improve. thank you for your advice!
"nope, ive realised what mistakes and errors i have made from the comments and i know what ive done wrong, i will practice more and improve my racing skills"
yup i was in the green lambo
"Those smart pants who sent messages you like ""practice more"" are most likely the guys who got dived lol. Your style is aggressive and you can make it with improving braking mostly. There is nothing wrong with overtake in first corner btw. Little bit wide in exit cause of hitting curb inside but there was no crash so ok. They may say there is because they are kind of people who wants to the car besides of them should be stay away from them, at least 5-10 meter away lol. Keep improving things mate. In 5 years or more or less, you will be like Kevin Estre..."
personally i didn't have sound on
"haha youve noticed that 😭 my broke ass dont turn on the air conditioner unless its at night. it was in the afternoon so ive turned on the fan, thats probably u heard the wind noise"
"Was genuinely wondering if his rig was in the back yard so he could get some ""realistic wind"""
"Also if you are this new read and understand the [sporting code](https://www.iracing.com/iracing-official-sporting-code/).

Overtaking and getting lapped is still too often misunderstood and hence leads to accidents.

Also save yourself from getting reported, you are paying for the service and if permanently banned you will get nothing back.

Edit: Get to now what the vortex of danger is! Really helps you avoiding 4x."
You have a good attitude. It can only go up if you keep it that way
Practice more
found the guy whos on a vacation
"His style is lacking racecraft, but ok be butthurt."
They're just simply illegal moves that only worked because the other driver had his wits about him and avoided a crash.
the point about the first corner isn't that the other to stay a few metres away. but if the outside car hadn't carried abysmal entry speed and had squeezed some more there would have absolutely been contact
"i dont agree with this. in the second attempt, if the other driver didnt back out of the turn we both would have crashed. like i have said earlier, divebombing is a pretty shitty move to pull unless youre able to make it clean. i didnt. ive got lots to learn and lots to improve. aggressive driving does not mean dangerous driving. i have definitely pulled off moves that i shouldnt have."
"Thought you were going for hyper realism, helmet cam gets noisy"
"got it, ill read this more thoroughly and get myself familiarised with the rules. thanks!"
Missed you all 🥲
"What about race craft here? There is no one around, they are battling on their own lol. If you mean, he should have the racecraft in battling, there is still not a point if there is no any solid strategy lol."
Well... I don't remember Kevin Estre and especially Max V. in 2021 got any penalty from their 9/10 dive moves by FIA but would have been by 2k s around here ha?
But nothing happened right? So...
Luckily iRacing has different rules than professional racing.
yeah the problem is that you won't really know that the other person will carry that bad a corner speed beforehand
to be fair the iracing sporting code state nothing about overtaking
We can think about that when it happens.
"It's not, but there is the line ""drivers can also report reckless and/or erratic driving and attempts at on-track intimidation"". And iRacing has often gone on record that things like this don't fly.

There is also no part about unsafe rejoins, while that is always a slam dunk protest."
just moving or deleting your telemetry and replay files would probably free up enough space that you dont need to move it.  check your paints folder too if you use tp cause sometimes it wont get rid of other players liveries and that adds up too.
"I use junctions for this. Look up junction magic, it's a neat tool.

The end result is a bit like using shortcuts to folders but it works at the system level. It's therefore invisible to any apps and works just like normal file/folder access.

I keep my main iRacing settings there and have replays and paints moved to another drive."
"Thanks man, I had no idea my telemetry folder was 25gb"
"You don't need external tools for this, it's called a symbolic link, you can do it from cmd

    mklink /J D:\LinkToFolder C:\Users\Name\OriginalFolder"
couldn't quite get it to work but thanks for the tip
np.  i found out the same way since my boot ssd is only 223gb and i have iracings data folder in the c:\\ drive and i have most of the tracks and a good bit of cars
Are you sure symlinks work across drives? I remember there was a restriction with it.
Yeah it does. I had to do with to another SSD at one point until I eventually upgraded the original one.
Found Ross's Reddit account.
"Had to let loose and do a hosted session for once,  had a blast."
Great racing and incredible editing skills mate!
"slowdown and decided to be a dick about it, or prior earlier on in the race?"
That’ll be a lovely ban
Please protest his stupid ass.
typical f4 nonsense. shit series great car.
Blatant block.
Holy shit. So he got dq for too many incidents then went and punted the next guy for good measure? Jeeeeez what a piece of shit!
"I never met him the whole race tbh
Btw this guy was Mika Abrahams and he races real F4 cars so shame on him"
Btw he didnt have a slow dow
"Lol, get back at him by posting this to his race team 😂"
"Holy  shit, he did at least 10 races today, that’s 10 consecutive hours of racing wtf 😳"
[Nurburgring Endurance Championship](https://www.iracing.com/series/nurburgring-endurance-championship/) starts in April.
"I’d very keen to do a PCC enduro. I’m the Clio community manager so would be able to help organise the Clio side of things. I know one guy setup a single longer PCC race at the end of last season, but it was in US Timezone so I couldn’t participate. 

Check in on the PCC discord https://discord.gg/Tn862d5S and see if you can find more people."
"If you don't want to go to gt3s, maybe you'll find gt4s as being a good middle point. They're heavier than gr86/mx5 and less nimble, so they require a bit different driving - but the racing is fun, and there's two hour endurance races every other weekend (Michelin pilot-series).


The TCRs also compete in those races, but it might be harder to find races with good participation outside of Michelin sport for that series, depending on how much you want to run. "
I help run an endurance league. Was debating whether something like this would be a success. Something like 2h24 minute races appeals to me. Maybe PCC plus Jetta and Slowstice for that club racing feel....
What cars are Cup?
">*Experience the thrill of racing on one of the world’s most iconic race courses with the iRacing Nurburgring Endurance Series. Take the wheel in one of five classes,* ***GT3****,* ***GT4****,* ***Cup****,* ***TCR****, and* ***MX5*** *in some of our most popular sports cars in a series of endurance events. Whether you’re sharing the cockpit with your teammates or trying to conquer the track on your own, this multi-class event offers one of the most unique challenges that a sports car racer could ask for.*"
"Ah, very cool! This would be a great start!"
"Shoot, I didn't know there was a PCC discord! I'll join it and post the question later on today. It'd be great to have your support if you're up for putting something together–we could probably find a timezone compromise that works for everyone!"
"Funnily enough, I jumped right into GT4s after getting to C class last year and I just don't get on with them haha. I thought the pilot series sounded great–I just couldn't get over the understeer, and so went back to PCC!"
"I think this would be a mega combination–I know both of those cars have pretty loyal fan bases that don't seemingly have anywhere to run them right now. Plus, that many different cars would make for some proper multi-class racing! I think the length is good as well–could be fun to run regular 2+24s with maybe a longer one once a month or so?"
Porsche Cup
Toyota GR 86
"Last year the mx5 wasn't run anymore thought, having been replaced by the gr86. And we haven't gotten an announcement for this year yet "
"We're going to put together a four race test season with 100 minute races. By keeping them a little shorter we can encourage solo entries and give ourselves the best chance of getting a decent sized grid together. We'll charge a small fee as it deters people registering and ghosting. We'll do some light touch post race stewarding, we have a stewarding team. It'll run on Sunday European evenings. I'll be advertising here and on various discord servers."
Kinda bummed no one’s asked me
"Firstly, when you add someone as a friend there's no notification or anything so it's hard to spot, and then when they do finally notice it, they've forgotten who you are.

Secondly, friends on iRacing is one of the most useless features. It's not like most games where you would friend someone and then be able to play on a team with them. You have the teams function for that.  


The only 2 features I'm aware of it having are to be able to have a friend spot for you (used once or twice, and there are ways around it anyway) and I think you can jump into the same session that a friend is in (but given it splits based on irating and you have no idea if you'll be in the same split, seems somewhat limited in its use).  


You can send messages in the race (as long as they don't quit immediately) so if there was someone I'd want to race against I'd just drop them a message and do it through discord or something."
Personally not sure. Kinda depends. But i'm not sure i would really see an incoming request
"Back in the day when there were way less people, it was much more social. You’d race against the same people a lot more often and get to know them. We used to catch up in chat before the green flag and then after the race. 

If I have a really good race with someone I’ll often shoot them a request."
Only from hot limber female Russian drivers.
"I don’t think I’ve ever got a friend request from someone i raced with, you just gotta get lucky and hope orating is the same since you may never see them again. I have iracing friends from actual friends, old guys i raced with on ps3, people i painted for, and a racer or two. I only use it for one friend so i can spot/crew chief for him, other than that its pretty useless for me"
"I’ve had some people add me over the years after having some really great races with them, of course accepted, but it seems rare anymore. It’s more or less just talking about the race after finishing anymore, then go separate ways. Still much more cordial than any other game out there."
Where would you even see that?
Can't pick who I race with so don't really see the point in being friends if it's not a team member who I occasionally practice with.
I've tried to add a few people over 10 years. Never accepted me. Anti-social crowd I guess. Idk where to make friends on this game besides leagues.
"If it makes you feel any better, the 7 or 8 people who've accepted my request after a nice battle just sit on my friends list, never to be interacted with again lol."
"I don’t because I suspect it’s probably someone wanting to send me verbal abuse so why subject myself to it.

This is probably conditioning after years of playing league of legends"
Most people don’t see them. You have to log in to the website. And even then it’s not totally great or easy to get to your inbox and request. Needs a refresh but truly needs to be added to the UI
"I personally wouldn't, not that I didn't respect the racing but I just do all the social stuff on discord. I honestly wouldn't even be checking my iRacing friend requests very often and by the time I did I'd have no idea who you were.

Maybe just throw a link to a socials channel to people you enjoyed racing with in the chat, anything post-race just doesn't work well in iRacing yet."
Is there an inbox FR go to?
Most people don't see them. There are people I race with that I chat on discord with who have had to be told either by me or by others that they had a pending friend request so we could join sessions off of them. Some people just don't use or aren't aware of that functionality.
Personally I only add my irl friends
"I didn’t know you send/accept friend requests in iRacing.

I’d like to find some folks of a similar skill level and interest to race and practice with. Was thinking of finding a discord league or something for that."
I would if anyone wanted be my friend. 😮‍💨
"This is a good point. I was in leagues for ten years on all different consoles and games. ACC, Pcars2, GT, etc. and we would recruit in open lobbies. When I switched to iRacing…I don’t see any of that. We are always in “open lobbies” but I’ve never heard or seen any recruiting or even any mention of leagues. Of course you can search for leagues but that’s not been successful for me. I have to believe there are a ton out there, but not sure how to find people or teams like that."
Yup I do
Disabled. And the best thing about the new UI is that stupid blinking green light is gone.
"If I know the person or I see them regularly in a low-participation series then I will. Otherwise I tend to decline. Nothing personal, I just don’t want my friends list clogged up with randoms I raced once or twice."
"I'm in a popular oval discord and I probably have 20ish iracing friends from people I've met on there. The best use of it is to see if anyone you know is racing and try and join a session with them. 

I work from home and sometimes I just like to have a race on in the background... I check my friends list and if anyone I know is racing I'll just spectate and have someone to root for."
only if i know them or talked to them before on discord or something.  theres a follow button right next to add friend for everyone else.  its not like it really does anything anyway.
Had no idea it was a thing. I guess no one wants to be my friend. These sims are so realistic 😁
In my experience with reddit or games Ill notice a list of requests months after they were sent and end up deleting them because I assume the time has passed
"lol I friend request people and nobody accepts. I'm eastern time zone, race after work like 6pm to 9pm usually. message me"
"I sent some to apologize to people after watching eplays / say that it wasnt a bug deal if they spun me after i didnt notice that they apologized or something , but no one ever accepted me , shame tbh . I really enjoy playing with randoms and communicating after the game . Makes me think for a moment that there are still good respectable honorable humans ."
I’ve raced for almost a decade now and I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a friend request lol
Yes if the interaction during the race was good absolutely
"I did, but then I realised its pointless. There is no chat system in the UI so seems a pointless addition."
I do but often forget to check to see if I have any incoming.
"Dang

Thats stings more"
I'll be your friend. We can be lonely together
The button to see and join the session your friend is in is essentially the only useful part of the system. I use it a lot to hang out in practices with friends if we wouldn't usually be in the same session.
Bottom right
They likely never saw it since it doesn't pop up as a notification despite there now perpetually being notifications.
"Twitch streams.  Lots of people hang in a variety of channels and you'll see a lot of the same ""faces."""
"They can actually verbally abuse you without being on your friend list, if they do you on the forum you will get a mail with their message even if you haven’t added them"
"Lmao , as a league player ( a very chill one at that ) i find i make alot of ""one game friends"" in league , i really found that the way you speak to people can really make even the most toxic people somewhat friendly or respectful , there are of course cases where i just meh just mute this guy and move on , but it s all a mental thing .

My friends usually tell me ""if we had your mentality in league we d be masters by now"" . U just gotta keep it clean and not think much about it , someone sends u verbal abuse ? Mute and move on its totally fine who cares lol , never engage with those big dick fights over chat ."
It’s in the UI my dude.
i don't think i've ever sent a friend request through the website
"Check the sim grid website , i went there and found a random league on their first season , i happen to own the content for all their races so i joined and so far it s good . 

If you race open wheelers check igpfun for f3 , impeccable league with huge grids ( we re talking 50 + grids ) and very respectful racing ."
Okay. I’ll watch for you!
"Yeah, I suppose for people you don't know it would work. But for me, all of my friends are on discord, so if I want to hang out with them I don't need to use iracing, I can just ask. It makes it slightly easier but, yeah, could be implemented sooooo much better."
you can do that just by following someone though
Probably right. A revision of the friend UI would be cool. A game based on multiplayer with a lot of decent features already could use an upgrade there. It's so basic and almost non-existent. Sucks for us with no buddies in discord.
"We need the forums integrated into the UI, it would make things so much easier"
I just have chat muted by default bro. I don’t need to see what these people are typing in order to play the game. Same reason I don’t use voice chat in iRacing
Oh cool Haven’t seen it that I remember.
I haven’t either just accept them there
I will check those out. Thanks a bunch!
"The chief thing our discord group uses it for is to jump in practice sessions together. Say I get on and see my friend is already practicing lmp3, he doesn't need to know the session number for me to join him. I can do it with one click in the friends list."

"There is class B Pro 2 Races
I typically only race pro 2 and pro 4! Heck they are the whole reason I got into Iracing in the first place. I have grown up watching them and some day hope to race the real thing! Heck of a lot of fun!"
You should be enjoying the races no matter the license class
"Here are the official series for dirt road:

https://boxbox.design/iracing/2024s1/dirtroad"
This isn't an WoW you don't grind for levels/Licenses. Grinding out SR is how you end up in a car you don't belong in with out the skill to control it or the race craft to understand what's going on around you.
Imagine paying for something and then spending a lot of time doing it and you don't enjoy it. lol
"Thank you for answering, I love them too but its so empty. Rarely do I get to race them, if I need a higher license I'll work on my sr."
thank you for taking the time to not answer the question.
100%
So glad you know my skill levels
Imagine an entire license class totally empty and having to take advantage of every race you get.
"The rookie classes still have a higher class racers participate. I see them more in the pro 4’s than pro 2’s. The guy who currently is rated #1 in the whole Pro 4 official class, I just raced against him a couple nights ago and he is flipping fast. In Crandon he was doing I believe 1.10-1.11, I was happy with 1.15-1.16. I see plenty of A and B racers in my Pro 4 races in the class D Official races. They split them which is another thing to consider, I have worked on my lap times and SR and have now been driving in the top class with more A and B drivers."
I mean you could have googled this. Don’t be lazy and an asshole
"He didn't answer because you should already know this; you are supposed to read the sporting code before you race.

It will benefit you by saving time and will benefit others because you'll be a better and more informed iracer."
"I don't think people on here realize how dead this type of racing is, only 6 people per race. top guys come down to my class and leave the rest of us comically behind."
"Yeah it is dead compared to other classes. Wish we had more people, but it is still a ton of fun"
"Imo, its the best racing on the platform. No need to push early in the race or be overly aggressive. Strategy plays far more into positions. The only downside is the the limited schedule, but that does also lend itself to people knowing the circuit better. 

I normally race LMP2 or GTP but will occasionally run GT3. Sometimes, different classes have trouble co-existing at lower splits, but generally as long as you're not driving super aggro, you should be able to spot and avoid trouble."
"GTP cars can deffo oversteer if you like that and have hella downforce. I race the caddy mainly but from what I’ve heard the Accura is the most similar to an open wheel race car. 

As above comments say the longer race means people are slightly less aggressive BUT it’s multi class and overtaking/being overtaken by a different class of car is its own skill as you need to predict how they’re corner entry will be different to yours. 

I LOVE THE IMSA SERIES!!"
"Races are generally far cleaner and, because the races are longer, there are far more corners to drag your safety up. I can't remember the last time I did an enduro and didn't gain SR!"
"It's usually cleaner. The attraction comes from running cleanly and consistently and knowing your strategy and playing the long game. 

At the 24 there were a few times we were chasing a position over multiple stints. My brother got us within 10 seconds of the car ahead, then I got in and we knew they would pit 10 laps later so I went flat out. When they came out of the pits they were right in front of us and I passed them 2 laps later. It was pretty sweet having a single pass be a team effort."
"It's definitely safer, but there's also less ""racing"" since people tend to think long-term.

Or if you are of similar pace, the following driver may choose to safe fuel by following closely"
"I race SF exclusively. 

The SF is on RB Ring this week, which is a safety rating nightmare. I dropped from a 4.5SF to a 3.5 on mostly just off track points. 

The trick with SF is to get out front during qualifying (1,2,3,4) or start from the back. Anywhere in between and you're gambling on T1.  If you want safety rating, then running from the back and practicing overtake and safe driving is you best bet."
"I have won NEC, IMSA endurance and VRS endurance in 2-3K SoF. I also was P2 in Daytona last weekend in 3,5k~ split.

Racing in endurance races is very clean, but to be honest single-class racing is always dirties in my opinion. Multi-class, be it IMSA sprints, endurance or special events are usually fine."
[deleted]
I did my first endurance race at Daytona last week and it resembled bumper cars to me. I've never had such a race. Maybe because there were 55 cars on track but it just seemed for the 1st hour it was chaos and I was hit multiple times
Imsa endurance races every other weekend are extremely clean. It is at the nurburgring combined circuit currently and lots of fun.
How long are the races?
This! Many in the endurance races realize it’s not a sprint. We just won our Daytona 24 split (GT3) by being safe/smart and consistent.
"There used to be strategy, but now tires and fuel happen at the same time. What strategy is there? Basically just a competition of who can drive the most consistent hotlaps. 

I still love them don't get me wrong. I just remember when saving tires ment a 30 second shorter pitstop, no there is no reason to save tires or drive less aggressively."
The last race where I didn't gain SR in an endurance race was when my SR was already above 4.5.
"Part of me likes that strategy aspect though! It's not just pushing full out until checkered, there is an element of positions, as well as fuel and other factors like race time."
…what does this have to do with endurance racing 😆
"Guess the SOF:

I'm going to say 1.4k."
"First hour of any enduro can be a nightmare. Incidents are more likely because everyone's bunched together, and all the idiots that were never going to finish are in the process of removing themselves from the race. Things always settle down after an hour or two."
NEC is mostly four hours with a six hour in the middle of the season.
IMSA is 160min. VRS Endurance is 180min.
Depends on the event. Every other week there's a 2.4 hour Enduro  for IMSA. There's special events that range from 2 hours to 24. There's the 6 hour endurance every few weeks as well.
So i guess fuel plays absolutely no part? Tires normally aren't replaced every stint unless you're trying to finish a lap down.
"Just because people tend to think ""long term"" and drive a bit safer, doesn't mean there is less racing. Far from it. What happens is throughout the race you find the people with similar pace. You have more opportunity to watch their lines, moves, and reactions. You can play SO many more games and test your opponents in different ways. When the end of the race comes around, you're close enough to really, REALLY race those people and hopefully you've been taking notes."
[deleted]
Roughly 2.4k
How do you see what’s upcoming when you’re looking at the schedule? The IMSA race sounds interesting!
"If you are taking 50% or more fuel, then there is no reason to not take tires. You lose no time."
"lol. Not at all just busting balls. Drinking and playing behind slow people on the golf course. You all good people! I didn’t even read his post past endurance racing, so I’m the dork obviiii"
Oof
"Just look at the road racing schedule and make sure you're not filtered by your license class. The IMSA one is called IMSA endurance. If you scroll to the bottom you'll see all the endurance events coming up and when you find one, just click it and go to the schedule tab to see what days and tracks are coming up.

If you want the big special events just google iracing special events 2024. Next one coming up is Bathurst 12 hour and then sebring 12 hour."
"Basically IMSA alternates between 2 hour 40 minute races one week and 6 hour races the next week. The race normally the same track that IMSA runs that week but does change around special events.


The 2 hour 40 minute race can be done solo or as a team. The 6 hour race must be in a team of at least 2"
"Thats absolutely not true. Just look at the Daytona 24h. If getting tires cost no extra time, every team would have gotten tires EVERY stop. Avg GT3 times were about 22 seconds shorter when going full fuel vs fuel and tires."
"Fantastic, appreciate it!"
Awesome info thanks
"I raced the GT3's and the tires get done before the fuel. I almost guarantee you every team took tires every stop if it was a normal stint. I am still going to confidently say you are wrong, but am open to evidence that will change my mind.

"Steering ratio is generally the same across many, many cars, so if you’re having to adjust that each race, it sounds like you need to check your wheelbase settings. Once you set it in iRacing it will save across all cars*. Brake balance on the other hand is specific to each setup that you load into the race with, which is sometimes an open series or a fixed series. IMO, as a general rule you’ll never be certain what your BB will be when you load in so it’s a great habit to, by default, always always verify your setting when you start your engine"
That’s so tragic
No it's definitely a thing in oval to set it in a track by track basis
I’ve been doing ovals which kinda requires it
"Yeah you’re absolutely right. I was thinking road on that point, but you’re right. The steering ratio (or whatever the name is) is the first thing I check when I load into an oval race."
"That was delicious driving, a nice change of pace from the usual wreck fest."
Great driving on both parties. That was probably fun as heck!
Nice patience
Nice driving from both of you
Nice
I love when moments like these happen. It’s rare but it’s why I keep playing :)
This has inspired me to just bite the bullet and build a PC. I’m tired of GT7
That was beautiful
So so so good! Well done mate 🤩🍻
Neat
How do I get this livery it’s so sick
Of all places i was not expecting that corner. Nicely done. 
Great!
Not a lot of room for those big cars
Is that a Neko Atsume wrap?
What is this skin?
Nice driving by both
"My actual internal monologue was 'wow, this is the definition of Close Racing'.  This video was a highlight for both drivers IMO."
"Thanks! He did a great job facilitating a safe pass too, felt like Lewis Hamilton in the moment haha"
"You won’t regret it! If you have a VR headset by chance like a Quest I would recommend that, I’ve been sim racing in VR for years and I love it"
"Download a program called Trading Paints! You can pick all kinds of different liveries for your cars, and it allows you to see everyone else’s custom liveries."
a bunch of cats lol
Which headset do you use most? What did you use in the video?
"So sick, thanks so much!"
"My current headset is a Valve Index, but I started out on an OG Oculus Rift."
"So proper PCVR gear then. VR sim racing is so cool. Have you tried a Quest or some other wireless headset? If so, what did it feel like? I'm specifically thinking of the latency when using wireless."
"I haven’t ever used a wireless one for sim racing, I have a friend that uses it and says for the most part it works well, but you’re out of luck if your wireless signal strength drops, introducing weird stutters etc. not to mention the battery dying, I would recommend using the link cable if you’re gonna use one of the newer wireless ones"
"Too many people sleep on lmp2
It's just such an unpopular car it's so sad

I did 2 full imsa and global endruo champs in it and love every second"
"LMP2 was very popular until the GTPs came out, it's not surprising that people prefer the faster and newer cars tbh."
"Oh agreed
Just sad that it died off tbh 

I moved up to GTP due to being 2.1k in lmp2 I was usually just driving alone due to everyone either being 3k plus and using it as a main for yrs or a few lower IR guys like me making the steps up to big boys easier 

Now in GTP im racing guys my IR and about my speed so actually battling 

But LmP2 taught me a lot about prototype racing so I always recommend it to anyone"
"Yep.. all the time.. 
It's called netcode and someone posts about it here daily..."
"You clearly don't understand how the internet works.

There is always latency and what is shown on your screen will differ slightly from what other drivers see on their end, and most importantly, how to server calculates everyone's position."
Net code giveth and net code taketh away.
"Netcode taketh. 

I'll take 4x and no damage to 0x with damage any day of the week."
Classic
"Look how much you had to slow down the clip.

Look how close it was.

Think how big the world is and whereabouts your opponent could have possibly being.

Think about how the internet works.

Give your head a wobble."
"Yeah, I know. But it's doesn't stop it from being frustrating. That corner around Rudskogen is a tough one in the f1600. Though it was pretty cool I was able to narrowly dodge the car and hold the grip around the outside there. I don't think I could've done anything else to keep the lead, so I'm not too bummed about the 4x."
"but you won't post here when you netcode thru someone without a 4x.... it happens often too.

account for netcode else you aren't a good racer. if a singular 4x in a race is catastrophic for you then something else is wrong."
Protest him and get him banned - this is egregious and people like him should not be on the service
"Hey man, if you don't mind, please check out my reddit post. I think you protested me... your description is almost an exact match. The only issue is that I don't have a Facebook account and I have never messaged you.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1ackwxb/i\_got\_protested\_for\_harassing\_someone\_via/](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/1ackwxb/i_got_protested_for_harassing_someone_via/)

&#x200B;

u/michaelneu let's have a chat if you want. Just not through facebook, please."
That’s 100% unhinged behavior and not normal. I’d protest this easily. Going outside of the game to confront someone is just crazy. I wouldn’t be surprised if iRacing skipped past a warning and went straight for a ban or suspension.
This is harassment. What a sore loser... Sad.
Someone posted here like a month or so ago that they'd done this and didn't expect people telling them they're a psycho. I wonder if it's the same person
Last week somebody said over voice chat another guys address. I thought it was incredibly weird.
"This is not normal. This is someone who is incredibly immature, serverly unhinged, or both. Personally, if I had a Facebook page (shit like this is a big reason I dont) I would have never responded and blocked them instead."
Love the thought of someone not being able to fathom a last lap wreck at Talladega 😂
“No sorry is that an Apple thing?” Is the best answer
What an ass. The entitlement of some people...
Protest him on this we had a******* contacting peoples jobs a few years back. This is completely and utterly unacceptable.
BLock instantly next time. Dont entertain trolls or angry people. You cant talk them down.
">Is this normal?

lmao"
I had a guy look me up on Facebook and threaten to show up at my house once because I didn’t lift when he blocked me at charlotte entering turn 3. Told him that probably wouldn’t be a good idea unless he wanted it to be his final day on earth. You’re tapped enough to show up at someone’s house over a video game it’s not even worth trying to reason with them.
Report to fb also.
"This doesn't surprise me at all after hearing the non-stop tantrums on NASCAR races. The amount of whining and fragile broken egos (sometimes just about getting passed) that come with almost every race is insufferable. Road racing has its complainers, but nothing like the NASCAR boys."
This could very well be a permaban for that guy
"You see somebody messaging you on your personal Facebook because of an incident.

I see somebody trying to set a 'getting banned from iRacing, any %' speedrun world record."
one time an idiot found me on Instagram and promised to kill me if I was in London o\_O
If anyone from iracing staff is here seeing this post this is exactly the reason why I asked you to change my in game name to something not quite my actual name... shit like this is unacceptable for gaming. no little shit stain in online games should be able to find real personal info on people they've met in a game...
That is super interesting. Really glad you are sharing this story with us
"Please protest this person.  I bumped someone on accident in a race a couple weeks ago,  said I'm sorry,  and this guy waited 30 fn laps and also after I got the lead, then crashed me out.  I've always been a non protest kinda guy. I let it go.  THEN I got protested against me for some silly stupid shit.  Made me think I shouldn't let so much of it go.  In general I still think it's the right thing to do,  however that other incident I should have protested.  I really should have.  You should too. Fuck that unhappy asshole. Blaming other people for everything.  Fuck him.  I hope to God he's reading this,  whoever the fuck it is.  Fuckin idiot.  Sorry. Lol"
"This is exactly why I don’t use my real name, ever. People are psychotic."
"Not normal, block and report direct to iRacing and they will deal with it. Don't even engage with this in the future, only a path to misery.

Have fun racing out there and ignore the scrot."
Jesus I didn’t know there were people this batshit insane. I hope iRacing bans this dudes account if you report him
"That's half a step away from swatting. Definitely not normal behavior.

Seriously. How sad does your life have to be to take a game this far?"
"Man don't even engage these people. Block, ignore, and report to iRacing."
What a loser
"This is one of the reasons I emailed iRacing, requesting a name change. I don't want my real full name to be easily exposed."
Hahahaha fckin insane people reaching out for a fckin game.
"One time some guy sent me an email asking me to cancel my report because he got banned for 2 weeks, it was nice to read"
"Someone did this to me after the 24 and I reported them and they haven't raced since the 24, so they probably got banned"
"Protest him, iRacing needs to know about this pronto."
"Didn’t even read the messages but from the title alone, this is easily harassment. Definitely report."
"If you can link their facebook to their iRacing account, absolutely protest them. This sort of behavior is not to be tolerated and I would be extremely surprised if iRacing didn't permanently ban this individual if enough of a link could be proven. This is some next level creepy shit."
"That’s psycho

Also, where is there a cool down for protests?

Edit: where = why"
"yeah, protest the race and attach this screenshot. this is creepy AF."
No that would be stalking.
Psycho shit
This dude is unhinged. Doubly so over a Superspeedway crash of all things 
"You know who he is take it to iracing 
That's not cool"
He should be banned for life wtf
"I can tell you for a fact, when iRacing gets this protest.  He will read the words ""indefinitely suspended""."
Iracing takes this kind of harassment very seriously send a protest with the screen shots
"If you include this in the protest they'll likely be banned on the spot. You don't settle shit outside the service. We have the protest feature, what happens in iRacing stays in iRacing"
fuck this dude.... protest the shit outta him
"Folks need to realize this isn’t that serious. Rick Hendrick, Toto Wolff, and Michael Andretti aren’t going to come calling."
Call the cops!!!!!
Ive been on the service for years and this is news to me. Make me curious how often this happens.
![gif](giphy|2diYvJgLHN5bkqVMuf|downsized)
Damn bro sounds like he’s super stable.
This is why I use my second name in iRacing
strange guy
"It says a lot that he’s in a split with someone that only does iracing for a month, while he’s doing it for years lol"
Imagine being SO BUTTHURT you have to FACEBOOK someone to give them grief. Holy shit what a sore loser and a bad sport. Fuck this guy
"why did you even admit to that, some stalker shit."
"I had someone message me on IG after I made a mistake(my 3rd race in iRacing), felt pretty scared tbh"
Racing for years and insists overtakes are only to be done on the straights?
I think your friend just posted on this sub with some new drama lol
Lol this guy in a 949 sof iracing field takes this game waaaay too seriously......
Absolutely not. Report this guy and get him gone.
Iracing wont ban him. I’ve done this to someone. General “please don’t do this again” email. Worst they’d do is chat ban him.
"Okay yeah that's kinda what it felt like to me, I totally get being upset but not saying anything in game or the forum and finding my personal account just felt uncomfortable."
"This is actually not protestable. Daniel Gray on Twitch dealt with this exact issue, and after many disputes back and fourth with iRacing, they stood their ground and said they can not use evidence outside of their service as proof. iRacing did offer an option to combat this for all users, you may change your name in game by messaging support to a name that is fake so it does not fall back on your Facebook. If this member messages you directly on iRacing forums, that is protestable. Outside of iRacing is not.

On the flip side, when someone is dogshit and I need them to know that, I ask them nicely to add me on discord so I can freely voice my opinion with no repercussions :)"
If only. I had someone find my fb account and threw racist remarks about my partner. IRacing didn’t give a single shit. Fuck their entire protest and appeal team
Na we should not be using real names to begin with.  Only a matter of time before people start doxxing the fuck out of one another the more popular sim racing gets.
I agreed with you before even reading the messages. Then I read them. Fuck this guy.
"Came here through your post, someone tell me if you guys settled it"
"Wait a second this comment is sketchy as hell..

I think this is all fake now, either both OPs are the same or this new guy is lying to get out of the protest.

Why would you make this comment rather than just DMing? Why the weird ""just not through facebook"" half joke thing at the end if you dont even have an account?

Sorry, detective brain."
Here for the results
Ha. Thats wild. Do you got a link to it by chance? Seems like a good read.
Thats the easiest ban ive ever heard.
Record and report that shit as a protest for sure
This is 100% means for a permaban.
"Throws me back to CoD MW2 on 360, but it was usually almost always wrong.

This kind of shit on a paid service coming from ""adults"" is just disgusting and should absolutely be an automatic ban."
"Exactly.

""hE rUiNEd mY rAcE!!!!""

If you take a friggin video game seriously enough to look someone up outside the service, time to take a break. 

You're not a racer, you're not an ""athlete"", you're not going ""Pro"". You're playing a video game. Time to come back down to reality."
"Not just Talladega, a 20 lap race with no cautions at Talladega. I always go into the draft master races expecting to be crashed out and not get too pissy about it.  I have had good racing and some pretty atrocious racing in that series.  Contacting someone on Facebook about the race in iracing is a whole new level of crazy"
"Someone tried to contact my boss over a fb post of mine once.   He laughed at her and said if they did it again, hed call the cops on her."
"The NASCAR boys took ""you're either first or you're last"" a bit too seriously"
"You can use a fake name? I thought your name had to match your billing info. You use a virtual/prepaid card?

I agree though. I find the real name thing to be very, very strange from iRacing. It doesn’t discourage people from being toxic. It just puts people in danger imo."
Same.
"You have to wait for some cool down period after a race before you can protest, I think the purpose is to prevent people from protesting out of anger in the heat of the moment"
What are the cops going to do here?
Get arrested for that probably.
how did you know the SOF? lol
"Yes please, definitely protest him.
This is highly toxic behavior"
Dude this is SO SO FAR OVER THE LINE as to what is acceptable. He's literally doxxed you. Protest him and get him removed from our community.
"this is why you shouldn't use your real name, it's insane to give people all the tools to dox you in game"
"I've seen someone get a permaban for doxxing a streamer on twitch and then blackmailing him on Discord.
It just really depends of the severity of the case."
"Don't know how exact but you can provide YouTube/stream links for off-site unsportsmanlike behavior when people admit to deliberately wrecking, cheating or sharing accounts. Also abuse and being toxic.


IRacing probably mean they can't act on non-public facing written abuse. It would be trivial to fake the screenshots on this post if you wanted to set someone up."
"Yeah, it's such BS though. I tried protesting someone that was berating me on discord and they replied with this, saying they don't police outside things. I responded saying that's clearly not true because they ban people all of the time for things they post on discord, aka leaks, and they also banned someone for saying they'd stab someone with a fork on Twitch. They never responded. They're just hypocrites.

"It's not doxxing. You are free to use the service which asks that you use your real name. If you don't want to do that. You don't have to. 

You can't sign up willingly and then cry that your real name is there for all to see."
"You don't have to use your real name, you can easily get it changed."
Contacted u/michaelneu and waiting for a response. I am sure we can work this out. No hard feelings from my side at least. Mistakes happen.
"I have contacted them via chat as well, don't worry. Reddit has this ""Chat-Request"" feature, which is a hidden menu within your chats.  I have missed requests multiple times already, that's why I am tagging them here as well.

I am just trying to lighten the mood with the facebook joke.

Trust me, I am sitting here wondering what the odds of this happening are.

Edit: I don't know why u/Mix_Traditional gets downvoted. These are valid questions."
"They don’t verify it, you can use whatever name you want as long as the payment goes through."
"You can simply send support an email with the request to change your ingame display name for privacy reasons. They changed my last name without question. I guess they are okay with fake names, as long as your 'fake' name is actually believable and not taken by another (real) person."
You can email for a one time change for privacy purposes. They didn't previously accept that as a reason but last year or so they changed it I believe
"Officially it needs to be real but in practice it just needs to sound real. 

Honestly the real name policy is generally a good thing I feel. If nothing more than it means talking about a race involves actual names not ""xXx_GameRacer42069"""
"Ah that makes sense I guess.

But for me I just forget to protest all together"
Call 9-1-1!!!!
Tweet it to your state representative!!
maybe they were in it behind you lol
This is not doxxing
"Doxing or doxxing is the act of publicly providing personnaly identifiable information about an individual or organization, usually via the internet and without their consent.

So this isn't doxing."
"No, iRacing doxxes people.  The service is too big to do this shit now."
"This isn’t doxxing. Their address is not on that screenshot nor have they disclose their address. 

This is however a good example of why is important to protect your social media."
"It's not really BS though. The iRacing community has become a little too protest happy. In my over 10 years on the service, I have protested maybe 3 people. I typically only protest intentional wrecking during a race. I don't care if people hit me after the race, even if I lose SR. I don't normally protest that. 

Just the other day on IMSA, I was spun going into turn 2 at Daytona. I slid across the grass into the exit of turn 2 where I hit the traffic in front of me. Some kid raged about it, and then protested me for an unsafe rejoin. iRacing accepted the protest and said I should rejoin more safely lmao. Like what? Did you even watch his replay? I was sliding sideways across the grass with my brakes locked and I slid into traffic. What else should I have done?

Cool off a bit on the protests guys"
I also choose this guy's wife
">You can't sign up willingly and then cry that your real name is there for all to see.

I'm kind of impressed you just don't get it."
"Hi Everyone for clarification, I reported the wrong person because I had no replay and was confused because no in-game names matched and I thought the message said he finished in 16th. I replied to iRacing and am hoping they can remove my protest on OP."
"Thanks, I just wanna find out who actually took time out of their day to search for them????? How much time do they have on their hands??? And yeah I get mad at people when I crash but I never use voice chat only text chat but never curse words or anything like that, just a “why did you do that?” Or a “what happened there?”"
"Nah, I changed my last name on the service years ago, I told them it was for privacy reasons, but really I didn't want my bosses to be able to look up my race history and find out I was doing races on the clock while working overnight shifts."
??  NOt sure what you mean but making a false police report generally ends up in an arrest for the person making the false report.
"Consent is the important part of this.

I am comfortable having my real name shown on iRacing because I agreed to that expectation up front. I personally find that showing someone's actual name helps me stay level headed - it's much easier to get gamer rage at some anonymous pseudonym. When I remember that there is a real human sitting in a chair somewhere, likely trying just as hard as I am, it makes me more liable to give them the benefit of the doubt if they gave me a little shunt or tap.

Doxxing is revealing that info WITHOUT consent. I would be angry if Dota 2 showed my real name to someone cause I have not signed up for that."
No....no they don't.
I didn't say it was doxxing. Just showing that iracing can use outside media to ban users (twitch and discord in this case)
You are right.  People have no idea what doxxing is.
"I agree and disagree. I think a lot of people are soft and can't deal with tempers flaring when wrecks happen, so I think protesting language is really childish when you can just mute people. However, protesting on track behavior is a good thing imo. Any time we can remove someone that ruins races, the actual thing that matters, and ruins people's time, it's a benefit. That being said, I'd also agree that the stewards are wildly inconsistent and come to some *interesting* conclusions when they have blatant evidence/replays in front of them."
"Explain it then, because from what you've currently written you have no idea what doxxing is.

""No, iRacing is doxxing people, the service is too big to do this shit now"""
"Thank you :)   
Don't worry, mistakes happen."
"Based on the info in both your threads and his comments in the screenshot, would say the perpetrator is either the 9 car or 7 car.... do with it as you may....

EDIT: leaning more towards the 7 because they have a ""car contact"" listed last lap"
"Ah okay, hopefully the right person is punished for this."
"No idea, man. People are weird sometimes."
"Tbh this is the exact reason why I switched to a slightly different version of my real name on iracing. 

I racing is ok with changing your name from something like James to Jay or David to DJ etc.... you can just say ""my friends call me by this nickname"" (truth in my case) and they'll switch it. 

As long as you're not requesting a change to something like ""Junkyard Dog"" or ""Maximillan Verstappen"" or another irl racer/celeb they'll most likely approve it..."
"When I worked at a national telecom in Canada, I'd do races in meetings. Put the video chat as an overlay in VR and boom"
That is technically privacy reasons to be fair
xD
Lmao consider me corrected then
Calm down. It’s a joke. You must be the fun guy at parties
"> Consent is the important part of this

I consented back in 2009 when the internet was not what it is today.  I'm an infosec consultant.  Using your real name for games provides 0 benefit to your life whatsoever and just introduces nothing but unnecessassry risk.  People get swatted over stupid fucking shit.  I had some other dude crash into me yesterday in turn 1 pushing me into another car and the 3rd dude involved acted like I fucked his wife on the mic.  You people are unhinged."
"You're confusing doxxing with harrassment.  Crypto devs ""doxx"" themselves as showing their identity shows confidence in a new token.  The point is you're matching up a digital account with a real life persons personal information, such as their name.  The details don't actually matter, it's that you don't get it's fucking stupid."
"Wow crazy good detective work, I believe you’re right that it’s one of the two"
"It’s been narrowed down to two people, I made on additional protest on one and wrote a long response saying that I incorrectly identified someone in my first protest and that I am not certain of the person who messaged me, as well as if iRacing need any other clarifications to reach out to me and please don’t punish the wrong person if they cannot tell. I also said that the person who messaged me would have reported me (I have not received notice that I’ve been protested so it’s probably in review or wasn’t accepted) That’s the last of what I will do in regard to this, I don’t want to have any more collateral damage and I have a feeling iRacing can’t be certain without a replay either. I’m not sure if they’re allowed to do detective work involving finding the right person so I blocked the person back on Facebook and am moving on."
"Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime;

That's why I race on company time."
Im the fun one yes.  I dont ever have to see you again though.  Neat.
and there were also multiple times that iracing asked you again to confirm you still consent with the terms and conditions and everything. and if you didn't still consent then you wouldn't still be racing
"Jesus mate you can't doxx yourself either!

Doxxing is with malicious intent. Sharing your information as part of financial transparency is literally the opposite of that."
iracingstats.net is a great site to sift thru results really quickly 🙂
"Yeah, no need to put more energy and time into it, you’ve done all you can do. Good on you for going this far to find out who did it as well as the other commenters."
k
When are the SoF races typically? I've always found it fun to drive but the fixed Pro4 series goes official so often in comparison
Never get enough to have multiple splits.
"Yeah, but when are the SoF races?"
"Against AI, no. Online, yes but if it’s good WiFi it shouldn’t be too much of an issue. Mostly a higher chance of lag spikes but responsiveness it shouldn’t be super noticeable"
"While wired is better, I have stable fast internet and have never had a problem over wifi. You could join open practices and monitor it for connection problems."
people on here will tell you that wifi is this or that but ignore the reality that so many on iracing are on wifi and that wifi isn't as bad as it once was.  Research on how to make the best of wifi and also consider other methods to be hardwired.
"I’m on wifi, as long as it’s good WiFi, you’re not 800 feet from the router, and there aren’t 5 people in the house streaming shows or playing games online you’ll be completely fine. I’ve never had any issues with lagging and my ping has always been very good."
"Makes no difference. You'll join a race session and be allocated a standard ""artificial"" ping to the server either way.

If your WiFi normally has lower latency than this, then it matters not one iota whether you're wired or not."
Just depends on the WiFi and strength. My rig is in the same room as the router but on a WiFi 6 connection. Usually get 2ms ping in speed tests and have never had issues/complaints in races.
"Mugello is great period, one of my favorites."
F3 @ (insert any track here) is great*
yeah i dont get why people film clips with their phone from their monitor either .
"The person could've gotten distracted while racing and lost control ... but more than likely the driver was retaliating against the black/blue car because if you stop the clip before the collision, the black/blue car's driver side is beat to hell. Regardless, #4 should be protested."
"![gif](giphy|AlcNwH92PZiD0tyVPH)

I think this was your driver"
Just report and this guy gets a save bann
"You tell us. What happened earlier in the race to lead this person to behave like this? 

Or do you expect grown people to believe this just happened out of the blue?"
It is how car should be driven in nascar
Lol
what can i say i was lazy
Gotem
gotta be in portrait mode too instead of landscape
the #4 got hit by netcode in turn 1 so he deiced to wreck him
I'm just as poor and stupid as you Kenny.
i did
It doesn’t justify what happened. Guy should be reported either way.
Report the shit out of em. We don’t need people like this in iRacing.
"Who said it did?

The OP asked a question. Why do people behave this way? He knows."
You seem to have the same mentality as the car in this clip.
"If OP fucked up he should be reported as well. But as we  only have this incident, we’ll give him/her the benefit of the doubt. And I saw people doing this because they’ve been overtaken. Stop with this freaking victim blaming FFS"
"That's a ton of the player base for NASCAR oval track. A bunch of lonely 53 year good ol boys whining about current drivers and talking about why they should have, but did not make it, to NASCAR. They talk continuously until lap 3 where they only become quiet as a salute to their lord and savior, Dale Earnhardt. 

The players with this attitude almost always think retaliation is okay."
this wasn't even me i was the in front of it
"Your wheel base will be Ok if you let go, your hands not so much if you don't"
"Most of the time, you won’t need to let go. For typical large wall impacts, iRacing will cut the FFB signal. I often have zero instinctual response to let go when I slam into the wall and have never been injured. However, if it’s a lighter smack while spinning, there are times where you’ll want to let go. I had one of those recently. I spun the P Cup and tried to hang on to it. It was fine up to the point that I caught the wall slightly and bounced off. If I didn’t let go, my thumb would’ve been screwed. 

A good rule of thumb (no pun intended) is to just not be stubborn about it when there’s little to no hope of regaining control. IMHO, you need to worry more about the times the car spins and massively loads up the front tires when you try to counter it. In that situation, the wheel is more susceptible to a sudden, sharp ramp up in constant force. iRacing filters the insanely large transients, but not a sudden, large steady force. You’ll generally know when you’re at risk, because the wheel will already be WAY heavier than any typical cornering force. IME, you’re a passenger at that point anyway, so you might as well let go, stomp the brake, and let the car do its thing."
"In the past, iRacing sent the full force to the wheel during a crash. 

Some time last year if I remember correctly, they made it so that crashes cause less FFB, so you don’t need to let go as much as you used to."
"Well iRacing is a sim so, both feet in, arms across your chest, once your car comes to a standstill and the safety crew reaches you, get your HANS device, drink, and earpiece/radio disconnected, and jump out.

But in reality, I always let go when I crash just to be safe. As others have mentioned, the FFB gets cut with wrecks, but I’m not taking any chances. I’ll only hold on to the wheel if I’m crashing/losing control slightly enough that I think I can save it or get a quick recovery without hurting myself physically."
"From my opinion , and I could be very wrong, most times I’ve seen people get hurt it’s from an unexpected accident or moment. They aren’t gripping it tightly, something happens and they can’t catch it fast enough and the wheel snaps and hurts you. I cant remember the clip but someone in an open wheeler on Spa got rear ended on unexpected, it was either a parade lap or under a safety car, and got his wrist fucked up because of it. 

There definitely are moments where you want to let go if you know it’s going to be bad. If you get bumped or lose control and are going head first into a wall, might as well just to be safe.

Edit: not an open wheeler and it was on Assetto, but here’s the link

Ever seen a wreck irl? The drivers let go... letting go adds to the immersion
"Most games will limit a burst of feedback like that, but the best advice is to commit to one of the other. Hold tight or pull back. Most FFB injuries are from getting smacked by a spinning wheel from being loosy goosy with it, not from the wheel being able to out torque your arms."
"This might be hopelessly optimistic but I want to build good habits for if I actually get some opportunities to race for real.

So I let go"
"Ask Danny Riccardo after he broke his hand in Zandvoort...

Granted that's a real F1 car, it's generally good practice to let go of the wheel before an impact for this reason. This is primarily in real life, but if your DD wheel is strong enough, I'm sure it's possible to break a hand on the sim rig."
Let go and stand on the brakes
I let mine go. It can hurt if you don't
I damn ear broke my thumb with a 9nm when it whipped in a wreck and I didn't get my hand out the way quick enough. I would for sure let go and get my hands well away from it on 12+.
"It's a hazard I have popeye forearms and great grip strength from my profession, and only play on 8nm dd. Something my old man told me when I got my full licence and was able to drive alone ""if you know you've fucked it.. a roll-over whatever and can't save it, save yourself and don't grip the wheel"" 
Fingers can get stuck, wrists twisted ect...."
Definitely let it go.
"I have the CS DD and play at full 12nm and don't let go. I started at 8nm and worked my way up to 12nm over the course of two weeks though. 

When I first started doing open track days the instructor would teach to let go of the wheel and hold the brakes but as you get faster, things slow down and if you let go you can't try and correct. If you are completely crossed up while going off track, you are probably gone anyways but completely up to you just hold your brakes please!"
I let go with my CS DD 12nm
It's a good habit to develop for real life as well. Hands folded across your chest once the car is unrecoverable.
"I suggest you the opposite when you are driving always keep both hands firmly on the wheel.
For this reason I strong suggest to use separate shifter only with rounded wheel."
I never let go and hold the brake till the car stops. Letting go of the wheel and not applying the brakes is what makes it violently shake.
[deleted]
"No point keeping hold, you won't have much influence over where you end up until the last final roll back or forward."
"I mean, why not?

Not as if it's really going to affect your crash if you're already into a wall"
Drive it till you know you cant save it then let go.
"12nm is no problem, I use stronger FFB and just hold on to the wheel. 

The only situation where you want to let go is when you have the max steering angle and your hands are in an awkward position. I have hurt my hands a few times like that, but nothing serious."
Always let go in a crash. Foot on brake and let go of the wheel.
I have a 20 nm base . even if iracing cancels the first the force I still let go mthe error base will be fine
"If you set 100% smoothing in game, fast peak forces are prevented (like when you hit a big sausage curb or you lose the car and it snaps back hard), the setting act like a slew rate limiter. You don't lose any details in FFB and it make the car easier to catch and the wheel easier to hold.

So even if the iracing crash protection don't work for some reason, it'll prevent too much peak torque.

But in my experience, the crash protection is  flawless, I can go straight into walls without any issue."
"Crashes that you expect vecausebyou're sliding already, took too much kerb etc, they're not so dangerous. you can either let go or get ready to hold it in an impact, latter being nonsense if your race is most likely done anyway.
If you expect that sudden jolt, it's no biggie, really. The injuries happen when you're fully concentrated on a corner and somebody smashes into your side all locked up - even if the actual force in the wheel is less than when smashing your car to bits, it's sudden, and you're lightly holding the wheel to feel what the car is doing. In those situations, there really isn't much you can do, I doubt your reaction time is good enough to entirely let go of the wheel in time.

My advice is, learn to hold the wheel better, thumbs are outside of the rim. If you can make that a habit, it won't matter if you let go or not, if there's nothing to catch itself on the wheel. Miles safer, and arguably, you have better feel aswell"
Ive seen alot of ex race car drivers in my league often liking the higher ffb settings so much so they have it written in their rule sets that intentionally wrecking is not allowed because of the possible injuries that can occur. They do pull their hands off generally to avoid injury. Turning the force down is an option though.
I was taught to wrap my thumbs around the outside of the wheel with my other fingers when I did track days years ago. This was to prevent injury in case of an accident. Still do it today in iracing.
"I did not hold when I was playing acc, but in iracing theyve made it so that crashes cause less fbb. Im using a simicube 2 pro at 100%."
"When DD wheels were still new, crashing the IndyCar on an oval legit hurt. Nothing too bad, just sent a shock through the hands and arms. It was kinda fun, made the fear a bit more real!"
You guys use your hands to drive?
"Let it go
Let it go
Don’t break your thumbs anymore"
I hurt myself trying to save a street stock with a csl elite😅 definitely let go
I race on a T300RS and I've never felt the need to let go. I can imagine with a truly strong wheel it might not be a bad idea though.
I have the Simagic Alpha and haven’t had any issues (yet). But it isn’t a bad practice. But if you’re going to hit the wall and *not* let go then make sure you have a very solid grip on the wheel.
I don’t mean to sound rude but based on what you just described it sounds like you found the answer very easily
Let go of your wheel if you want but please make sure you hold the brakes
"We'll put it this way. Consider a real life racing crash. You've been bumped or otherwise caused to lose control of the car. You're headed for the wall, you know it, and there's not much likelihood that you'll regain control before you hit the wall. Many drivers in this case (knowing a collision is coming) will let go and cross their arms at their chest. This prevents hand and wrist injuries, and keeps your arms from flailing about the cabin, especially if you don't have arm restraints. 

So yes, even in sim racing, if you know a collision is about to happen, and control of the car doesn't matter much other than being on the brakes if the car bounces back into the track, I'd let go and let the wheel do its thing. 

I have personally extended one of my thumbs and while it wasn't serious it was uncomfortable. And that wasn't even from a crash, just an aggressive countersteer while drifting and my thumb was hooked on a spoke. 

If it's a light wall hit and you're gonna keep going, hold onto it and maintain control of the car. If you're sliding, going off track and gonna hit the wall or another car hard, I'd let let go. I have noticed iRacing isn't as extreme as other games too. Don't get me started on BeamNG 🤣. First time I started it up with the direct drive wheel, spawned in, and was in the menu flipping through settings for controls. The truck was rolling down a hill, up a berm, and bumped a tree and it ripped the wheel out of my hand before I knew it was happening."
[removed]
"I was wondering about this — microcenter near me has a race sim with a 25 nm wheel and Iracing along with a disclaimer that you need to be 18 to use it. If you hit a wall, the wheel will probably hurt you. Guessing they haven’t updated in a long while."
And people still say iRacing  is a realistic sim…
You will not have the drink
Why drink after a crash? It takes blood away to the wrong organs if you would have internal bleeding?
"Yup, that's my experience too. If you hold on tightly, it's not a problem. It's when you're holding on lightly that you can get hurt, because the wheel whacks or yanks your hand.

The closest I've ever been to an injury has been multiple times where I was either reversing or trying to spin around after an incident. Because I have a formula wheel, it's hard to use a bunch of steering lock without taking your hand off the wheel. So when I tapped the wall backing up, it yanked free from the hand on the wheel and smacked the other hand.

Overall, my suggestion is to either commit to holding tight or commit to letting go. Don't half-ass it either way"
Damn
"I've only had a DD (Moza r9) for like 2 days and this already just happened to me today. Fortunately it only grazed my hand. I had just stopped well off the side of the road in a practice session and took my hands off the wheel for a second before reaching to hold escape on my keyboard to go mess with FFB settings. As I reached I got absolutely slammed at high speed by someone who must have braked WAY too late after the straight and the wheel went flying and hit my hand.

After already being honestly a little afraid of how strong the r9 is compared to my g29, that was a little jarring lol."
Yeah this is what ive found the case to be. Ive never been hurt holding on to the wheel properly but have when im like half holding it.
Letting go saves your hands and wrists in real life. And with these new features and such it’s probably in your best mind to let go
Does braking at 100% cut off the fbb signal?
Did you mean to say never forget to let go?
Ya that’s exactly what happened in my last situation. My arm were crossed from turning so much in one direction. I should have let go. Luckily one of my thumbs didn’t get stuck or something because that would have hurt when it snapped even harder in that direction.
So you’re regularly hitting 20+ nm of force from the wheel and not getting your arms ripped off? Are you the Incredible Hulk?
Well ya. I always hold my breaks when I wreck. I was more or less asking if it was safe for these DD wheels to let go of. I didn’t know if that could damage them internally or something.
Who cares about OP’s hands? Just don’t wreck my virtual race car!
"This is false advice.

Accidents do happen especially at this kind of force. You shouldn’t risk your health because of a game."
Wtf kind of advice is this? “A grown man.” Dude F off.. this kid could be some tiny dweeb and now he breaks his wrist because of some ego god like yourself said he wasnt “man” enough..
"Terrible advice. I've firsthand experienced the instant full lock to lock max torque movement in a crash both with a 9nm and 20nm wheels. Both are more than sufficient to injure or fracture.

There's a big difference between 20nm of force whilst driving normally and then the instant lock to lock torque at max speed. Both 9nm and 20nm are more than enough to fracture a wrist.

The best advice to give here is to not wrap your thumbs. First thing you get taught racing in real life and should be the first thing taught when using a DD. Don't wrap your thumbs so if the wheel gets ripped it slides in your hands. Otherwise you're gonna get thumb and/or wrist damage."
Any grown man shouldn’t have to wear wrist guards while playing with his rollerblades
"Dr Bodie’s “fuck off your fine” GP Surgery open for stonewalling peer pressure - pop in anytime as long as you’re a manly man.

Op - wrists can be delicate when twisting, you don’t need to white knuckle it, theres no one best option as everyone is a bit different."
I don’t know about the 12 nm but I could definitely break a finger with my Simucube 17nm
"The only person being wrong and loud here is you.  Holding the brakes is much more effective at stopping an out of control car.  In most cases, holding onto the wheel will make things worse as naturally you’ll be trying to save it.

I also do it for practice for the racing I do irl.  If I get into the habit of letting go for any crashes I have online, the muscle memory will be there if I crash in real life.

Quit bitching about other people.  If you have problems hitting out of control cars, maybe you should learn where the brake pedal is and you’ll come out the other side a lot more often"
jesus fucking christ youre a dense idiot
"in what way is a crashing car “controlled?” if my car is bouncing across the circuit, i doubt that is really in my control. 

and no one is a bitch for not wanting to be injured..

if you’re really this butthurt over people letting go of their steering wheels to avoid injury, you might need to get away from your sim for a bit.

edit: regardless of if iracing cuts off ffb in crashes, it is not always 100% correct and i have had my wheel spin in crashes many times. better be safe than sorry. but ok, keep being ignorant"
This kind of 1980s macho BS is embarrassing
"Not that I care about stuff like this, but It’s hilarious how someone who said basically the same thing, but nicely, has +34 and your comment is at -211 😂. Anyway, I hear you. You gotta feel it out yourself. My wheel never goes beyond what can rip out of my hands, and frankly if it ever did, that tells me the FF is too high for me. I don’t like high FF as it does nothing but tires my hands and keeps me from going past the limit of grip when I actually want to."
"You’re the one embarrassing yourself here.

The auto ffb cut patch wasn’t released until 6 months *after* your last iRacing start, your last iRacing video posted is some *2 years before* the patch was introduced.

You’ve been absolutely found out."
"I have only hurt myself once and it was when I let go of the wheel, it also fucked my $300 button plate up. I'll never let go, and people trying my rig will also be told this."

"No, the drink. Is it on?"
Meaning get the drink straw disconnected
I wear gloves for this reason
"No, but it’s the quickest way to stop the car from moving which will prevent the wheel spinning erratically. Plus you have the added benefit of winning a protest because you did everything you could to stop yourself from spinning back out on to the track and causing a multi car accident."
"Iracing minimises the ffb signal in crashes, you don't need to, maybe it's good practice for when you play other games."
Opposite of the hulk lol. I wouldnt dare to hold on acc but in iracing it’s no problem.
Bro is the type who thinks old IRL racing was better cause it was dangerous

"a child could hold onto it too lol but its very unlikely op is a child, simracing is for old people"
The island boy does it again👏
yeah 17 nm can do it lol
Go down with that ship!
"Yeah most of the times I've (slightly) hurt myself with my 25nm wheelbase is also letting go. Admittedly, sometimes ""letting go"" means the wheel is ripped out of my hands (in an accident that I had no clue that was coming) but that's when the danger starts IMO.  


iRacing also has technology to not just blast your wrists in accidents, some other games/simulators don't have that feature."

This guy.. owns a 12nm base but runs it at 40% loll
"They can’t, I tried it with a seven year old @8nm with the F3 car. He struggled while driving straight already"
I just finished running a couple laps today in the rig in Cincinnati. The wheel is pretty stout. I’ve never experienced anything more than a thrust master t150 pro. Now I have Googly eyes trying to justify the purchase to my wife…
"Yeah I’m in Southern California and  it’s the same problem here, super filthy rig with horrible FOV and monitor alignment. Wheelbase was set to 2nm and ppl were saying it was experience they’d ever had. I Fixed the FOV then turned the FFB up a bit and it was such a great time."

"100% always lol just under clipping, just say you're scared of your wheelbase 

also if you take your hands off and get clipped by the wheel thats how you get hurt

Edit: you guys are so dumb 🤣🤣🤣🤣 how weak are all of you? You guys are claiming my wheel doesn't react when I hit walls because I can hold onto my wheel???? Bro you guys are some dainty little kids lol"
I'm in Lexington and have been wanting to see what they have setup there in cinci. What wheel and base do they have? And they have triples? That's the next upgrade for me is triples so wanting to try it.
"From what basis do are you deciding that you’re right? 

You can’t say that real life drivers don’t let go, because they certainly do. 

You can’t say that there’s no danger, because people do get injured by their wheels from time to time. 

So your basis comes down to the limitations of your own experience, and you’re deciding that your own experience is enough to be the SME on this?"
"Wheels react when you hit the wall at those settings.

Yours visually doesn’t in your own videos."
"Wow dude you are braindead. Here is a clip of professional athlete Formula 1 driver Lando Norris with his wheel at full forcefeedback. https://youtu.be/Hs-7ga0jCB8?si=2XfibRz1i-SDz5Jb

"holy shit I bet you're awful in real life lmao

obnoxious as hell"
"It’s visible from his videos posted that he has his wheel torque dialed down to very low settings, one where he hits the wall the wheel has absolutely no reaction to the impact.

That’s the basis to his claim imo"
There's a big button in the top right of the ui that says test drive
"Silly question, but have you bought them?  
If not, either buy them or wait for test drive.   
If you have, then just test drive as you would any normal car."
Ok I’ll try that today. I don’t think that worked last time Does it have to be on a legacy track
Yes you can’t test drive a car before buying.
"As long as you own the car and the track you're good to go, legacy or not doesn't factor into it.


Legacy is just a tag applied to cars that there usually isn't active series for. "
No it doesn't. You can run whatever car you have on whatever track you have. As long as you own both. 
"Well, you can during maintenance using the test drive function but anyway.

Once you own a car, there is no difference between a legacy and non-legacy in terms of solo driving. The only difference is that legacy cars are not used in any official races. You can still use the test drive function as with any other car."
"One thing to note, if there is a specific legacy car you want to drive but don't own, whilst there aren't any official seasons running legacy cars afaik besides the arx? Legacy cars are much cheaper to buy than new cars."
Sick!!
Oh I had no idea you could do that
"HPD isn't legacy if it's in active service. They just didn't increase the price back to normal. 

Ringmeister has used some legacy cars as well"
"I did in the early days, then I changed series to something they didn't support so I've kinda forgotten about it"
"Telemetry feature works well, I use it similarly to garage61. Brake overlay is good for learning new tracks also."
Yes. Very much
"I use it to check braking points and pressures for different corners, and to learn where the real limit of the car is. I think it's a great tool"
"I find it helpful for very very easily and quickly identifying which part of the track I'm dropping the most time in.

At that point it's an easy telemetry compare combined with a video to watch about how their driver takes the turns etc. 

The tips the AI produces are generic - basically telling me what I can clearly see from the telemetry. ""Oh I need to be better at braking and get back on the throttle sooner to keep speed through the corner.. thanks.."""
I’ve used it to prepare for MX-5 Rookies week after week and seemed to be doing well with it. I went through the drills and got my trail braking from a D to a B consistently. I was getting upper 1:22s at Summit Point and was able to get into the 1:21s after using it.
Yeah I tried it last night after struggling with Hungaroring. wasn’t quite sure on it tbh I think I’ll try again another time
Is this your main learning tool? How are you using it to benefit you/what are the main things you’re looking at. I tried it last night but wasn’t too keen on it. Too much information too fast. May try again but think I need to familiarise myself with it
"Thank you, maybe I need to give it another go. I tried it last night but felt it was a lot of information very fast and I was always struggling with hungaroring so deleted trophy.ai and just kept doing practice laps for now 😂"
Thanks mate. I did try it last night but felt like it was an information overload. Now I’ve read these comments I’ve probably just got to take bits and pieces of the software to benefit me. I may try it again in the near future
"I basically get myself up to speed on a track then look at it for my fastest lap.

Pick out whichever section I'm losing the most time in, then practice that section with a reset point."
"as someone who recently upgraded from an rx580 on triples i just want to let you know youre not going to have a good time, especially on newer content, with that gpu and cpu.  when mugello and new okayama dropped and i noticed it was making my 12gb 3080 w/ 1440's kinda sweat on the new rig.  just for fun i booted the old system with the old 1080 triples on mugello and on the replay screen i was getting 20-30fps and driving 30 to maybe 40fps.  that was in a test drive practice session with zero other cars to render on screen with the graphics turned down to almost potato quality.  this is on an i7-6700k and a 8gb rx580oc both with a moderate overclock.

if thats all the system you can do for now i would just buy the first monitor of whatever triples you want and save for a pc upgrade before you go for triples.  just use your current pc as a single screen till you can upgrade"
"To be honest, why would you go with those sort of screens on a PC that can't run them, or at the least barely utilise them. I'm guessing at 31 inches they are also 1440p?

Better off upgrading your GPU and CPU first before trying to add that much screen space.


Edit: To add to the above, at current specs a single screen would be be fine to run and you could look at upgrading overtime or keeping an eye out for some good deals!"
Single screen or get a new computer man. Old cpu and low end older card. There’s no magic trick. And there’s no magically leap coming in tech because of ai this year. Yes there will be a new version of cpu. But anything from this year will last 5+ easy. There’s no point In waiting because a mobo i9 and 32gb ram is less than 1k…
"I can buy it, but the leap in technology that is coming with artificial intelligence in processing is worth the wait. But as I've been told that with a monitor I can play for now, so it's great for me. I will have 1 monitor until September/October. Thank you very much for your personal help."
"Would just changing the gpu be enough to play with all 3 screens? If so, which do they recommend?"
"I had RX590 triple 1080p. Was getting 60fps with low settings , but dips to low 40s.
Upgraded to RX7600 now I get 100+ with dips to 70. 
CPU is i7  2 or 3 years old, it is not maxed out 

It’s good 
In hindsight I should have gone 1 step higher, another $75 at the time 
Monitors are the same 
For 4k I think you need a lot more gpu"
"There will be no real “leap in AI” in processors for many years. And even if there will be, it’ll be a decade until programs make use of it anyway.

Where did you get that information from and what kind of leap do you expect?"
"> I can buy it, but the leap in technology that is coming with artificial intelligence in processing is worth the wait. 

I don't think we are going to see a MASSIVE leap like you are suggesting in the near-term. The setup you have listed is going to provide a less than ideal experience if you are still planning on going triples. I recommend you look at the used market for a CPU and mobo (assuming a newer cpu will mean having to get a whole new mobo in order to use it) as well as a GPU upgrade."
"the information came directly from intel. and that by 2028 most computers will already have artificial intelligence. I hope from energy optimization, several clicks according to use, anyway; optimizing systems without the need to previously configure them in the bios, for example."
"Would just changing the gpu be enough to play with all 3 screens? If so, which do they recommend?"
"That’s marketing speak.

Sure, hardware will get faster, have more features and be more efficient every year until then, but there really won’t be any magical leap in performance from one generation to the other that’s worth waiting 5 years for. Just upgrade your computer now (or at most wait for the next generation if their release is already close) you believe it’s not fast enough anymore."
"IRacing, from what I understand, balances out its load across the cpu and gpu much more than other software. The GPU probably contributes the most frames wise but it is much less than in other software. Given the age of both your CPU and your GPU, I honestly think you'd need a modest CPU and GPU upgrade in order to run even 1080p triples at +80fps. You need to keep in mind that every track runs differently in iRacing. Some of them are extremely easy to run whereas ones that have upgrades to its art assets and such run worse than other tracks."
"Best advice I ever got about SR: aim for being in the 3’s on average. 

4’s can mean you’re playing it too safe to be competitive (exceptions of course bring if you’re alien and pull away early in most races).

2’s might mean you’re not being safe enough (that includes not being great at predicting when to back out).

1 and lower: need to really look within, because you are most likely the problem"
I had a guy brag about being C class one time.
4.99 and slow as fuck ? Why am I in this post ?
I'll brag about having A4.99 licenses when I see someone bashing the rating system while in the same breath blaming other's for all of their accidents.
SR is like HP. It's a resource to be alternatively hoarded and used.
"""They race me so hard"""
There's a lot of energy in this post
The only time you can be a 4.99A and fast is if you're racing paved ovals or Rallycross because only one track gives 1x's (Barca).
After years of being on this service I finally learned that there are many people who stay at a B or C lic to race Pcup or similar and to be quick they regularly take off tracks to be fast. So their sr stays between 2-3.5 and they are fast and happy.
They don’t know slow is fast
The last day of the week 13 I went from B license to a D license. Worst day of my life. Girls like guys that take risks.
"Filthy casuals with your 4.99... If you write a script to interrogate the iRacing API, you can also get a ""Corners per Incident"" metric that doesn't top out at 4.99 :-)  (BTW, A4.99 is 139 Corners per incident)

I feel attacked.
Recently I’m struggling to keep up my B license to race a class D series. F4 - I love you but I hate you.
"I always was between C and B class, but not because of accidents, I barely had DNFs, but because of going off track a lot of times (not on purpose) in order to try to keep up with faster cars as longer as possible. In street circuits I always gained SR lol

With the new grass I am in A class now since a lot of off tracks end up costing time, so I just lose them and then do my own race."
"Quite true, one note:

If you're in 4, this means you can sometimes risk an offtrack just to be quicker, I've often fallen into the trap of racing more aggressively and it always bites you in the ass in terms of iRating gains. 

You can be right and still get crashed into."
Or like me and all you do for officials is endurance races
I have a bit that problem TBH. I almost bring the car to a stop just to avoid a 1x. This meme is autobiographic.
"Honestly, I’d have to hit things on purpose to keep an SR in the 3s. Also, SR can be viewed as a resource at times…."
"I’ve raced in a league a while back and this guy would constantly rear end me and complaint to me that I “was too slow” and “should learn to race”, yes he was 5K iR and I was 2k, but I was within a second of the leader lap time, so I wasn’t slow by the league standards. The funny thing he was a B license 1.3 and I’m A 3.5, after he complained enough I checked his official races, every single one he had at least 10x incidents and had an Ayrton Senna quote in his bio (it was a Brazilian league and everyone racing was). That explained all. 

Also I’ve kept an eye on his shenanigans, he is up to 7k iR now, but still have huge amounts of incidents, looking at his license it seems he always struggle to maintain B license, even tho he runs multiple endurance events. I find it funny someone “that good” cannot have an A license because of the amount of incidents he has per race, to me it feels like he only got his iR because every now and then he’ll drive someone out his way and “get a freebie”."
If I see someone on track with a licence in the 1s I stay well away regardless of the licence class.  If you can't even maintain the most basic safety numbers you are 100% a danger to others and yourself.
"Just learned a big lesson two weeks ago, went from 2.2k and 3.5 to 1.5k and 1.5 safety. Learned not to force myself to race tracks I don’t like n don’t have pace, race where ur comfortable and having fun, since giving myself that talk I’m back up and climbing :)"
"2's could also mean you just go off track too much. I very very rarely make contact with other cars. I'm still working on my track limits, and I've improved a lot but not enough. My goal is to be in the 3's and stay there."
Why are you attacking me?
"Well, if he didn't own much content, being C class racing rookies and advanced mx5 isn't that bad"
One of us! One of us!
I thought it was me!
The problem is when they really don't care about a 4x because it won't hurt them too much so they put their nose in when they really shouldn't and you have to chose to let them pass or get the 4x.
Did you make a Grafana dashbord for your iRacing statistics you nerd?
"Only recently got into iRacing and i needed one more D-Class race to be eligible for my C license, so I registered for the next F4 session, didn’t qualify so I could start at the back and then drove the entire race letting anyone coming up on me pass me for free focusing on nothing but making sure I had 0 incidents.

Finished like 8th, best F4 result I’ve had so far and it’s the only one I wasn’t actually trying to race lmao"
Lol then keeping 4.99 is easy as pie. Endurance racing is the perfect sr topping up tool.
"It’s probably just offtracks. I had A1.5 not long ago and I haven’t had a 4x in a year, I just don’t care about SR at all and would gladly take a 16x race if it helped me get a better result."
"tbf, anyone can get an a license. no one gets 7k ""because they drive people out of the way"". "
"It's not bad to be any class, but it is bad to brag about the class you are, especially if that class is C, considering that getting and keeping an A license is pretty much trivial."
You kinda just described racing
"At that point, irating becomes the real safety rating."
"Maybe :-) First I wrote a program to grab the iracing performance telemetry and poke it into an Influx database (FPS, CPU load, GPU load, latency, connection quality) at 1,2, 4 or 8 Hz... Then I wrote a script that grabs the driver stats via the API and noticed it had this Corners Per Incident value that doesn't seem to be exposed through the website, so added that to the database as well. (And then, yes, made a grafana dashboard for it)... This graph is the performance of my machine during a Skippy race at Bathurst

Or any Nordschliefe race as long as you can bring it home
"This is something that folks that focus too much on SR don't seem to understand. You can basically use SR as a piggy bank for lap time. Which can be huge if you can catch up to a train of cars for drafting.

That said, and something to be aware of, intentionally using off tracks to gain an advantage is against the sporting code and you can be protested for it. Those kinds of protests don't seem to happen often, but they do happen. Which is a bigger deal now that race results can be changed for DQ's."
Sounds like you're cutting corners. You're a hazard mate.  Face it.
"He is on B falling to C, not A to B."
A week at Daytona or Talladega can bring you down to B license pretty quickly if you have streak of bad luck haha.
Playing a racing video game at all is pretty much trivial. Making fun of someone for being content with their hobby is dirtbag behavior.
Why do people think it's hard to keep an A license?
"I meant it in the way that you can only get to the next licence of the highest series you're racing, so if you only race simlab (D) and rookies, you won't go past C 4.99."
"Ahh, good stuff :) I didn't know about that value. So you made me go down the rabbit hole of the api docs and now I know I'm at 141.0246 :D"
"A lot of people dont like it but at tracks like the glen where you can gain a huge advantage on the first corner to keep someone at bay in the dying stages it’s worth it.
A lot of the pros have a huge amount of off tracks but they’re are very selective and as for protests it’s difficult to prove unless you cut up the replay which would be a huge hassle that most. People wont be bothered to do."
"Yeah, you have a point. I don’t see how you can DQ people for it though, it’s not like we are running around cutting corners every lap. It’s just pushing hard and in some tracks (Daytona as a recent example) it’s very easy to slightly overstep the line and get a 1x. You’d have to ban the entire top split of every close race."
"For sure, if I could choose who I race against I’d always pick a 4.99 2000 iR driver instead of someone like me."
"https://preview.redd.it/z82r2y2matec1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc44f8a1540549260c3ffb567c8636f759f1a6cd

It can snowball very quickly, and if you get fast track demoted it leaves you at 1.x again. But yeah it’s also possible he’s just dirty haha"
Shhhhh. Don’t tell them our secrets 🤣
I lost my A after taking a few month hiatus and felt like a failure until i realized the imsa schedule wasn't that great and i didn't actually care that much.
"Idk why you're being downvoted. Not everyone cares about being max license and many others just don't have the time or ability. 

Nothing wrong with that. As long as everyone is having fun"
He said it was trivial
"I don't remember the exact details, but I do remember that there was a track where people did start getting protested because they were cutting a specific corner every single lap because of the time gained. I've only ever seen successful protests in those kinds of cases where it's very obvious they're doing it to gain time."
It's an inherently competitive hobby whose discussions are hosted on an inherently competitive and confrontational website. Being rude to people who don't pretend-race as fast as you is half the joy of it for a lot of these guys.
"And why is that? Not trying to be an asshole, genuinely curious. Is it because people drive unsafe and hit you costing you SR or what? Seems like keeping an A license would be just as trivial as keeping any other class"
"I don’t know what you mean. 

Trivial means it’s no problem to keep. You said it is easy to keep. You are agreeing with the other guy, I was pointing out that you guys are saying the same thing

Nobody (in this comment chain) is saying keeping an A class license is any sort of difficult"
"I guess I'm an idiot for thinking trivial meant difficult, lmao my fault. Learned something new today 😂"
Congrats... it ain't Draft Masters unless there's a 15 car pile up going into turn 3 and the tri-oval.
Simultaneously one of the most fun and most frustrating series in iRacing. Congrats dude!
"Watching this after going 0x in 4th for 25 minutes of the falken race only for a Proto to spin and not hold his fucking brakes so my shit got rocked, I’m jealous of that save if you can’t tell"
GG! Classic draft masters
This needs to be cross posted to r/sweatypalms
That wasn't all luck. That was partially skill
"I didnt and still mostly don't know anything about cars.  You should have some understanding on how your inputs impact a car but other than that, at your level you really don't need to get stressed out about the details.  

&#x200B;

Watch some youtube videos on drivng dynamics.  Things like how to approach corners.  What the correct lines are.  How weight shifts in a car.  What you can do to impact that.

Other than that man....just drive."
"I recommend watching DJ Vee-J to learn more about how cars work in iracing. Watching his videos really helped me a lot. Also, I would recommend watching Suellio even though he focuses primarily on road courses it wouldn't hurt to watch his videos, plus you could probably implement some of his tricks onto oval."
"Are you a reader? Buy a textbook and do some study. ""Going Faster! Skip Barber Racing School"" will teach you so, so much."
"https://youtu.be/6-sGV2XXUeU?si=p92YflnuPTynU8z7

Going Faster by Skip Barber. Fantastic video about the basics of driving fast."
"Start off slow in a test session. Like really slow. And build up your speed. Focus on doing the correct line. Then build up your speed and focus on where the limits are. Be very smooth and depending on the car, don't use 100% brakes. You're probably 'locking' the wheels by braking too hard and too suddenly."
"I usually don't recommend using the driving line at Ovals, but going ahead and turn it on and give that a shot.  Usually it's designed for Q laps, and the reason I don't recommend it in a race is that the optimal lines change throughout.  But, if your just trying to learn lift points and what not it's good.  Also, go to Charlotte to learn 1.5 miles."
"i remember ""knowing what to do"" came two ways for me.

)being obsessed with watching all and any circuit racing, telemetry and stuff

)gran turismo sport driving school

NOW i completely recognize you probably do not have gran turismo sport/7 but if you do the driving school is genuinely brilliant in getting you started and it'll just make the whole thing more fun. I also recommend using assists until you feel comfortable, then slowly experimenting with them off. It'll be more enjoyable that way, especially the ABS since I'd say a lack of ABS is much harder to get used to than a lack of TC.

Anyway, keep at it, don't lose hope and good luck/!!"
"First of all, make sure your wheel / pedal setup is properly calibrated for iRacing. 

Then it’s a matter of practice. I recommend DJ Vee J and Suellio Almeida on YouTube."
drive the track slow and keep speeding up a little until you can tell when the car starts to lose grip . you’ll get an understanding of how fast you can take a corner quicker than just flying off the track a bunch of times
Show us a video of you trying to break into a corner.
"What kind of controler/Wheel setup are you using? Are you using the driving line to find your breaking points into the corners? I know this will sound harsh but if you are coming from playing any other racing game (Nascar Heat, Forza, Grand Turismo) iRacing won't drive anything like those games. A lot of everything is learning the tracks for your breaking points and learning how to handle the car with the setup and not over drive. It's all about practice, and you will see that get throw around a lot when someone asks track/car advice."
"Also, make sure you hit f9 and set your force feedback correctly. Drive some laps and hit the auto button. If your force feedback is wrong, you won't feel anything."
"I genuinely don’t know how real drivers do it because my process for learning a track is crashing and missing corners continuously until I find the limit. Not saying you should do that but don’t feel discouraged crashing and learning from your mistakes. It works for me most of the time at least.

Edit: Crashing and learning from your mistakes in practice not in a race. You should be able to do the race distance in practice cleanly before entering a race."
"Start an AI race, but don't grid. Instead, jump into an AI car and ride along in Cockpit view. Watch what the AI does - their steering is a bit wonky, but you'll get the idea - and listen to the engine and the squeal of the brakes to see where they slow and what revs they are carrying through the corner, and where they begin to accelerate again. Then go and jump in your own car and try it for yourself.

The most important thing is to do everything gradually and gently, starting slow and working your way up to speed. Don't lift all the way off suddenly, and don't reapply the throttle suddenly - at least, not until you get a better feel for how the car will react when you do. Weight transfer is a big thing in high-level sims, and the car has to settle before you maneuver it.

Most of all - practise patience. No one ever got good at anything overnight. It takes a lot of laps to master a circuit - hundreds.

I recommend Pickup Cup races - they're unofficial, so you don't need to worry about affecting your SR and IR negatively - especially the Phoenix weeks. Old Phoenix can be frustrating at first, but again, ride along with other drivers to see how they are doing it, and copy them. At some point it'll click, and you'll start to enjoy it, but then you can take what you learned at Phoenix and find it applies to so may other tracks."
"Driving line
Follow it exactly
Use trophi.ai with the breaking noise
Don't break and turn

Still crash but less often 😂"
"i recommend just searching up and watching youtube videos and learning all you can, if you don’t know what to learn then watch more. There’s tons of videos on racing theories and different parts of it."
"I only do road racing but it can be a mixture of your pedal setup/quality and understanding the physics of moving that much weight on four tires. Sims will always feel impossible to brake for noobs at first because you may be used to arcade games and not how it is in real life.

If you press the brake too hard it abruptly shifts the weight to the front tires, the back lifts up a bit and the tires slide (oversteer). You need to be very smooth and gradual in sim racing. Abrupt weight transfers are tough to deal with."
"I know you're doing oval, but spend some time in the Mazda at the road courses that come with the game.  Doing something a little different can help get a feel for what the cars are doing.  I know doing more oval really helped my road racing; I'm sure the opposite is true as well."
You don’t have to drive the car in balls deep roll out of it early roll back in to the throttle.  Start finding grip levels and stack decent laps it will come young grass hopper
"Nashville is abit tricky. You can throw it into the corner but you better get your left tires down to the line to be able to really hold the corner when you throttle up. Not sure what car you are in but the arca cars are really sensitive. Its really hard to be smooth on the wheel in those cars but after some time you will get the feel. 

This guys videos are outdated but i always watch them before running a track i havent in a minute

https://youtu.be/Vj-jzH_yKkI?feature=shared"
Don’t worry about being fast. Focus purely on being clean/smooth and safe. Once you are clean/smooth/safe 20 laps in a row you should never have much issue at that track again. Your time will increase from there. Even if you are 5 seconds behind others.
"Try street stock at Charlotte. It's what got me hooked on ovals. Basically, I just jumped into a rookie race after a few practice laps and loved it. Great place to learn the basics before going to the faster cars. I'm actually beginning to dig the short tracks now, too. Starting to move to arca cars and / or trucks in C class."
"That's fine. Learn about cars, race anyways. Have fun, stay clean."
"Was in your exact position a few months ago. Zero experience and knowledge about racing. Everyone will tell you about YouTube, and books. Those are all great.

I highly highly recommend going out and doing a go kart race. Indoor is nice but outdoors recommended. Gives you real life first hand experience and that can translate very very well to a racing sim."
"Since you like oval, DJ Yee-J on YT is good. To understand why car's work as they do, read *Going Faster*, or watch Suellio Almeida on YT, even without his coaching video course it's good. However, if it's in your budget I recommend his course. If you're still hungry, more good concept building videos are on YT by Driver61."
Hard to say without looking. I recommend checking out Maconi setup shop on YouTube for their weekly track guides and DJ Yee-J for tips on how to drive oval. I’ve been racing different sims for years and I’m still processing the learning curve iracing has. These people have been really helpful for me personally.
"I mean, we all learn from our mistakes, so I'd just say practise a lot, and invest in a proper wheel and pedals if you don't have that to help you feel better how the car moves and shifts."
Im going to guess you are braking to hard
The ai for ovals is pretty trash honestly especially on easy settings. Try out live practices w real people once you can drive okayish. Watch videos for track tutorials
"How about using the iracing system the way it was designed and you could get better, potentially. You need to start like everyone else in real life racing in the lower ranks, my suggestion would be legend cars or the street stock series."
Dj yee j
That's a good one. Suellio's new book is also excellent. Both of these are road focused but imo the concepts will translate to oval for a lot of it and at OP's level there's a ton to learn
"This is Race Driving 101, every new sim racer should watch it. It’s focused on road racing but everything is applicable to ovals too."
"This is totally the case where someone should use the driving line for a little bit. I’m big on turning it off as soon as possible, but if someone really has no idea what to do, it’s a useful tool."
The racing line is actually pretty solid on ovals. Usually racing lines suck and tell you to brake when you don't need to but they're pretty accurate with the optimal Q line and braking points.
"He’s already breaking the car when he goes into corners, we need to see how he’s braking."
Fanatec csl dd. I am using the driving line but I eventually want to get away from it. I’ve played racing games like that on a controller when I was younger but not in a while.
"His name is Samir, there is no braking."
Ok yeah. It just seems like a lot of time and practice. As others have said there are a ton of beginners guides on YouTube. I'd watch a few of those and maybe even the iracing ones. I will say on ovals if you push to the wall on entry try letting off the gas earlier and braking a little tiny bit harder for entry. Exit is kinda the same deal. Let the car roll through center and get on the gas. If it pushes to the wall get on the gas later. Once you learn the track then setup changes can start making differences.
hahaha.   Forgot about that vid...  Now I gotta wach it. again.
if you have a 300 budget id look into just getting two more 27s that fit into that budget.
Fov isn't affected by resolution at all. Only by screen size and how far you are from said scree 
"Before you make your mind on comments ""I changed to single ultrawide and I see so much more"" - which I highly doubt on proper POV settings, check out this video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owwrNuK7aR8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owwrNuK7aR8)

That's the best comparison by far I've seen on YT. It's not worth going ultrawide, as you still need to rely on your spotter/radar indicators. The little extra part of mirror is not worth it the £300 extra money spend IMHO."
"So what you want is more screen real estate to be able to look ahead. Field of view is literally what you can see visually, resolution is the clarity. Remember, increasing resolution requires more computing power. A 34 inch ultrawide is my recommended minimum for a single screen if you wish to have any edge in racing. The curved super ultrawides are the best single screen solutions but start to run up to $1000-ish for high refresh rate with 4k models. 

Then you have VR, which is what I’ve used for the past  3 or so years (came from a 34 inch ultrawide). Just a Quest 2 but as soon as I was running with it, seconds melted off my times, my consistency went sky high. It’s because you can actually LOOK at the apexes, make quick glances at your blind spots and track cars off screen better, and be able to have general better awareness.

Quest 2 is $250 and does 120hz refresh rate, which is a cheap option to try VR. You will need a aftermarket usb cable (I can provide the link to what has worked for me, I do endurance races and sessions greater than 2 hours). I would budget another $75 for a good facial interface and head rest (can provide links to what I’ve found to work really well). I only recommend the quest2 due to its price. for a higher end headset I’d go BigScreen Beyond or wait for Valves next headset (which is what I’m doing)."
"I went from a 27"" to a 34"" Ultrawide and I really did like the change. 

I will say that the amount you can see doesn't change that much. A few degrees on each side. This has made seeing the apex easier on some tracks. But you still have no vision of cars beside you and still have to be comfortable turning in blind to some corners. It does increase the immersion having more of your vision taken up by screen though.

If you have a computer capable of rendering enough frames the refresh rate to me is a bigger improvement. When I went from a 60hz monitor to a 165hz monitor it was a massive difference. I can only explain it as being able to sense the speed a bit easier. Basically when you are capped at 60hz I felt like everything felt the same at a certain point. With a high refresh rate it feels like there is more nuance in the speed."
"I have a 34 inch 4k flat, normal aspect ratio monitor.  I love it, but I use it for everything, not just sim racing.  

A higher refresh rate is great if your PC can generate the frames; if you are typically getting 60fps or less while gaming/racing having a monitor that can go higher is pointless.

Response time is the delay between the input signal and when the monitor actually changes to display the new input.  So if the monitor has a 10ms response time, you will be seeing everything on a 10ms delay behind what is actually happening in the game.  For me, 10ms is a perfectly usable response time; people that play first person shooters with a mouse or other really twitchy games that demand really precise inputs faster response time is more important."
. I upgraded from a 27” flat to a 34” curved. I much prefer the curved since i can see more now. It still comes down to how close the screen is to you though as well
"I went from 27"" to curved 34"" ultrawide recently. Yes, you can see slightly more, but its not nearly enough to really see cars alongside or anything like that. Reason being is that FOV will be pretty much exactly the same unless you move your monitor closer. Distance matters way more with such small differences in size.

Think of the monitor as a window. How much more can you see standing 10 feet back from the window versus putting your nose on the glass? Yet the window didn't change size. Same concept here.

That said, I love my ultra wide so much I bought a second for my work/general gaming setup. You don't get much more in terms of FOV, but it does somehow feel more immersive and I really dig the 21:9 aspect ratio. It makes game worlds *feel* bigger, even if you aren't actually seeing that much more. It's like old cinema.

Refresh rate, response time, all that.. yeah, definitely helps. But thats regardless of aspect ratio or screen size. A high-spec monitor will make everything feel snappier either way, assuming your rig can push the frames."
"No, FOV will be same. If you want wider FOV with correct settings, you need ultrawhide screen, 21:9 ratio or higher"
"Sadly a single ultrawide does not give you enough FOV to see your mirrors, it does help with apex a little. 

High refresh you will notice. As long as your graphics card is powerful enough or you are prepared to reduce quality to get the FPS to meet the refresh."
"No. Get triples. 

I got a 34 expecting it to give more FOV. While technically it did it wasn't USEFUL fov. You got more A pillar and maybe some of the side mirror. Big whoop. 

Nothing beats triples for FOV. Not even VR because VR you have to turn your head. Triples you see things in your periphery. 

And if you need more evidence, go watch a Matt Malone video. He has a 57"" super ultrawide but still has to use look left/right buttons. The only thing that happens if I hit look left/right is I get a better view of the halo seat."
"I upgraded from 27 to 34 inch 21:9. I didn’t regret it but I would buy a used 49 inch instead if I did it again. 

But still, it was a good upgrade and I consider a 34 inch ultra wide a minimum viable option for sim racing."
"This is the way. My old desktop setup had a 43"" ultrawide, when I built a rig I switched to triple 27s. The fov is so much better I don't even have buttons mapped for look left/right any more and it actually cost quite a bit less to buy the three 27s than it had to buy the ultrawide."
"Yeah if FOV is all you’re after save your money and get triples later

As a single monitor (27”) racer myself I get his pain but the last thing I wanna do is half ass an upgrade"
"There is no 4k supper duper ultra wide monitors. If there was, i would buyed one. Them all are 1440p. But yes, there is 57 samsung but it is still two 4k together. I think 2025 we should get real 4k ultrawide"
I mean a bigger monitor that's 16:9 would still provide a wider fov 
"Indy Pro 2000 (est evenings, especially Thursday) and USF2000. Mix of ovals and road (mostly road), really fun cars, really cool community of helpful people (best community on the whole service), and generally pretty clean racing. USF2000 is D class and generally has races all day long go official. And the IndyPro is C class and doesn’t often split; which is actually kind of fun because the pack spreads out quite a bit with 4k drivers racing with sub 1k drivers."
"Any endurance race, there are some minor incidents but in general, it's pretty much clean.

Having few hours to repair your driving mistake make everyone calm.

It's rare to have a lap 1, turn 1 heroes"
I’m not being sarcastic — last night in the Draftmaster series at Talladega I had the most insanely close/clean racing I’ve ever seen. If there is one reason to gain iRating it’s to observe what people are capable of in the top split. I think the SoF was 3.5k or something absurd. I saved the replay of the last 4 laps because of how impressive it was. 4-5 wide at one point while being bumper-to-bumper the entire way.

87s on oval have been some of the more respectful races I’ve had. Just a bunch of old heads looking to have a good race.
Oddly enough rookie dirt street stock. I'm only 1.4k so it's definitely not because I'm top split. There's plenty of rookies in my races.
"Mosty ovals.

I've found bad drivers only in super popular series like GT3 GT4 and all multiclasses with prototypes. Half of those people can't make an overtake without fucking slower cars races. I try to avoid series with too many splits."

"I drove the usf twice, it was decent. I got crashed out once but I kinda put that to the time I was running…Was like 2 in the afternoon so I’m sure full of the fastest kids on the planet but I’ll try your times see if it helps"
"There’s no such thing as a perfect series. It’s all relative. 

I’ve had some dinguses in the series. But I’ve have far fewer Dingii in USF/IndyPro than any other open wheel series I’ve tried."
"Hey OP, have to echo the Indypro on this!  Close, yet clean racing from the front of the pack to the back.  I’m a former series champion and currently top2 in overall points.  I have a thread on the iR forums where I post setups and lap walkthroughs each week, for free.  Come check it out!"
"Definitely try the IndyPro too. While it’s less popular, the community is INCREDIBLE. People are very helpful, they share setups and tips, it’s really the best community in the whole game. Shame it’s so small."
doesn't happen to me. but i've seen some problems before with usb selective suspend on am5. causing drops around 4 and a half to 5mins into the session kinda matching what you are describing

If you're a sucker for punishment do the Porsche Cup.
For open wheel: IndyPro 2000 is solid if you plan to race during the evening in U.S. time zones.
Do you race road or oval?
Nurburgring and a good down force car. I like the Radical.
"I also just got to C class and have been enjoying the Touring Car series (also has fixed version for D class).

The C & D versions run alternatively every hour which makes it easy to get reps in. Plus VIR was the track last week which was a blast!

GT4/Liger multi class looks super fun as well - GT4 was a bit of a shitshow in D class imo. So hopefully this lobby is a little cleaner."

"Depends if you like tin tops or open wheel racing. If you like tin tops, get a GT4 car 100%. Easy to learn, hard to master. They have a great schedule and regularly have multiple splits with close racing. There's a D class fixed series and the C class sports car series which is open setup. After that there's GT3, which is one of the most popular series on iRacing. There's fixed and open setup series in B class as well as the D class Ferrari challenge. Pretty much every endurance race has a GT3 class to, allowing you to compete in those. Then there is LMP3, LMP2 and LMPH. They are faster classes of cars but have many users and a wide variety of series.   


If you're into open wheel racing, the ladder usually goes Formula 4 in D class to Formula 3 in C class, Formula B in B class (which uses a Formula Renault 3.5) then Formula A in A class which uses the Mercedes W13. There's also other cars like the Skip Barber, USF2000 and Formula Renault 2.0 which aren't really part of the main ladder. The Dallara iR18 is the car used for the Indycar series. They go to a mix of road and oval courses if you're into that."
"What type of racing do you like? Open wheel, GT, prototypes, and I’m sure there’s more I can’t think of."
Why not run Advanced Mazda? You already have the car for that.
okay thank you for the suggestions
honestly it doesn’t matter what type of racing. i just don’t wanna buy a car and track and have it be a dead series if you know what i mean.
Porsche cup is the most populated C class series i think. Then GT3 is B class and thats always popping off.  iracingreports.com has some info but i dont know if its very helpful
"There’s plenty of series that aren’t dead in C class. P cup, radical is often splitting most of the time now, gt4 is always popular, mx5 is usually good participation(zolder isn’t), and there’s others that are less popular and have 1 or two splits mostly."
Porsche is insane hard to drive though
Why is zolder not very popular in C class mx-5?
"I have no idea, I don’t even have the track so im just looking at the stats"

YouTube has plenty of guides."

"
I race a formula 1600 car in real life. My series uses different tires than the iRacing car but adjusting for that, it feels very close. Also, I’m a very average sim racer but in the F1600 car I was able to win a handful of races in a row when it was new. So take from that what you will.

There are several significant psychological differences between sim racing and real racing and you can’t really know how they will affect you until you do it. Can you push the car to its limit when you know you’ll have to pay a $60,000 bill if you make a mistake? Or that you might end up in the hospital? No sim can prepare you for that.

There’s also the pressure of having eyes on you, even if it’s just the team/car owner."
"Do both here. 👋

I tend to be better in a real car than I do at sim. 

There's more to lose, more invested, and more sensation overall. 

Long, whirlwind weekends, exhaustion (physical and mental), weather (heat, rain, cold), etc.

I think overall everyone tends to drive smarter in the real world too, which makes it all more fun. A little 2x bump in iRacing is something many people just brush off. That same tap in real life means someone has to spend money out of their own pocket to replace and repaint a fender, door, or wheel & tire before the next race."
"Daniel (?) Morad has a video on this, quite recently."
"You need three things and yes if you do. Be in good shape, the ability to be insanely calm under that type of stress, and lots of money."
I’ve had a couple track days after doing sim racing for about a year. It unquestionably helps in areas like learning the racing line and correcting oversteer or under steer and trail braking etc. but you won’t just get in a real car and be as fast it’ll just give you an edge at the start
"Yes. You’ll find yourself trail braking on your approach to the grocery store turn-in. Heavy traffic? No issues here — 180 fov leaves no doubt for maneuvers. Green light countdown? That Porsche Macan next to you doesn’t stand a chance, you’ve got plenty of practice with the brake maxed and full throttle. Accidentally sideswipe someone on your exit from the McDonald’s drive through? “Net code,” officer. To name just a few examples."
Impossible to tell person to person. More then likely you'll be better then someone who has the same real world experience without the sim experience.
Tube framed 911 I track frequently along with a caged 650hp z07. Very few things really translate directly. Mostly similarities.
Find out.
"Surprised at peoples negative responses here. There will be a huge adjustment required mentally and physically but the fundamentals of how to go around a corner quickly are pretty good in all major sims, obviously details will be very different and details matter.

I don’t believe for a second I could go and match my lap times in the same combo from iracing on the first day. 

But if you put in a bunch of hours into a car track combo in the meatverse the theory you’ve learnt will start to come through. The new generation of irl racers are almost all iracers too.

Fear barrier is huge and fitness is a big thing too depending on the car. People saying it doesn’t translate at all, how come jimmy broadbent won his first championship in the Praga? He literally practiced the car track combos he was going to be racing irl for hours then went out and won races. Him and a gran turismo player got a podium at a nordschliefe endurance race too. GT isn’t exactly heralded as a beacon of realism but even that prepared him to throw down some really fast lap times considering they had barely driven there irl."
"Highly unlikely. You’ll have to learn how to drive in real life on the limit, and build up muscle strength and stamina etc. 

Fear and focus are things the simulation cannot replicate, same with the physical workload. 

Most of the basics will carry over but you’ll not be fast in real life because of iRacing. Most drivers that go from iRacing to real life and vice versa have years of experience in carting or some sort of track day racing."
Absolutely not. It comes down to the individual. I drove IRL formula fords with my simracing crew - the alien simracer was by far the slowest on the day - I’m talking seconds off the pace on a short lap course.
"To an extent yes but also, possibly not. I’m relatively fast in iRacing but there’s not a chance I’d be able to take corners at the same speed IRL as I have far too much concern for my own life. I think race car drivers miss that little part of the brain that thinks “what happens if my brakes fail here” and fair play to them."
"There is almost zero evidence to suggest this is the case.  Sure there are cases where one has translated to the other but plenty of others that go the other way.  However good the physics in a game are they just aren't going to translate IRL when you add g-forces, the actual feel of the brakes, acceleration and other real cars on track.  Some very good racing drivers struggle with sim racing for almost the same reasons; they just aren't getting those sensations"
"As long as you're not in terrible shape, yes. IRL racing is as much about budget as it is talent. You can compensate one with the other."
"Didn't iracing do a test with this a few years ago? Its in youtube. They took the quickest guy on the service at the time and the answer was no.

Another way of looking at it is Verstappen and other f1 drivers race wheel to wheel with people who are just sim racers. I doubt those sim racers would be able to race wheel to wheel with them in an F1 car in real life."
"After remembering how many times I've 'died' in iracing, I think I'll skip the translation to IRL."
"People tend to say that real life is easier as you can feel alot more the car and everything else. But yeah, there must be a “fear factor” there. I only tried karting and honestly i thing the real one is alot easier to drive, although we dont have a proper karting simulator."
"If you're quick in a sim, you will have had a headstart on learning how to manage vehicle dynamics and racecraft and so you will have the potential to be fast in real life.

Some things are the same, some things will be different. You cannot simulate certain physical senstations, rattles, vibrations, rotations.

There is also no 'Tow' button so that may or may not impact your psyche somewhat."
"I think it all depends on a person.

In any sim you drive by using different info compared to the real life – it's eyes, ears and hands. In reality you can't hear how tyres are loaded (unless it's near to be a bit late) so this one is out. In reality you don't much rely on what you feel with your hands. This one is also out. Eyes maybe the same same.

In reality you get a massive array of g-forces pushing you in all directions. You feel if your rear is starting to miss traction noticing that acceleartion is not as should be. Or that a turn in feels different compared to the previous lap. And basically how a person is able to ingest this massive array of info, compare to it to the sim inputs and put it into the action defines a lot of irl quickness. Same with all other kind of sims basically.

And yeah, fear. Even in a go kart some turns look so intimidating so you wanna lift.

And quickness in any sim has nothing to do with irl. I 100% sure if we get any iracer with 10k irating, give him a red bull f1 car for a month with training and such, then he/she will be beaten 100 of 100 times by drunk Lattifi on a Williams. One shouldn't underestimate the importance of years and years of track time.

But sims give a good idea of how racing lines should look, racecraft, stress manegement (for those who don't rage quit after the first incident)."
"No, there are many things that do not get simulated. G forces for one. Fear, seriously. I seen a dude try to jump out of a car after starting it, well trying to start it. You can't see behind you very well. There is no virtual mirror. My car had a good setup and still I struggled, think of a small open wheel car like the FF or any of them really. Good luck, those side mirrors vibrate and often only give you a good view of the rear tire. There is just way too much that can not be duplicated to say this would happen. Sure, there may have been a few but probably had some natural abilities and a lot more to it than just going from sim racing to decent IRL racer. It is also very expensive. The tires are not meant to have a long life. That is just one small part. It kinda sucks trying to race a car that has to get you to work on Monday. Got a truck and trailer? It just goes on forever. It is not a sport, it is a lifestyle. To be honest the cars are just way to easy to drive in a sim for this to be realistic. Example, I can drive a Radical SR10 around Nurburgring in a little more than 6 minutes. You think I could get anywhere near that IRL? Hell NO.  
I will say, based on the three tracks I have driven in real life and then using the SIM, it would help you memorize the track, that is pretty amazing. I have had this image of the curbs at willow springs etched in my head for most of my life. The first time I seen then in iRacing I was pretty amazed at the accuracy."
"I had a plan to test this out for my 40th birthday a few months back. I live fairly close to Oulton Park, where they do F4 experience days, so my plan was to absolutely pound the track in iRacing and then go do the F4 experience and see how close I could get to my iRacing times in real life. That is, until I watched some videos of the F4 day and realised they rev limit the cars and put cones all over the track that massively restrict the lines you can take. So not so much of an F4 experience day, more of a ‘pretend to drive an F4 with some very restrictive and specific circumstances’ experience day."
"While car control doesn't directly translate due to g-forces, and frankly a totally new way to 'feel' the car, everything you learn in terms of racecraft and having the knowledge on how to find pace and learn a circuit, that translates directly and can be very useful. Ultimately, IRL racing will benefit your sim races, and the opposite, too. Knowing how to set up a pass or navigate stressful situations and traffic is invaluable, and in sim, you can spend as much time as you have to perfect that without significamt costs or risk of injury or ruining your IRL career"
"Absolutely not. The tyre physics in iRacing, holy hell. Pure absurdity."
Short answer: maybe. Long answer: maybe not
">you can’t really know how they will affect you until you do it.

Given how some people react to a 4x, I have a rough idea how most people would react to real consequences..."
I wouldn't even touch the car if there's a 60K bill to pay for crashing it.
Exactly!
"What kind of FF1600 do you race? If it’s something modern I think you should absolutely do a Ask Me Anything. Even if it’s only me, I‘ll keep you busy for some time"
Those cars cost $60K? 
"This. 

sim racing is technically cheaper short run & to get going quickly, but irl offers way more & costs the exact same to get started if going out & buying the best sim chassis, adding motion to it & best components on the market, a monster pc, VR and/or 49” ultrawide/ triples, iRacing content and buying all at once…

All that will set you back the cost of a skip barber day & 2 scca events if outright purchasing a car to race too…there are also lower barriers of entry based on cost, & some lesser known ways to race wheel-to-wheel, but it follows same lines of needing a race compliant car & all the gear, tires, tools, potentially additional truck & trailer to go all with it..

It really depends on what your overall goals are. Is it more of a goal as just a hobby, or do you want a career aspect out of it? 

Can’t get above FIA gold unless over 30 & completed other career-worthy achievements."
"I found IRL easier after tons of years sim racing, got in a race car and could actually feel the tires gripping up and weight transfers.  

IRL is way more expensive, much more tiring, a huge time commitment, REQUIRES travel to shitty locations, and when you add it all up, I tend to have more FUN sim racing."
? correct
Its bs video. They were new to the track and he's comparing his time against theirs and 5 seconds diff after a few laps is not that bad. Give a new track on sim and you'll need at least a few more laps too to warm up and fond the rhythm.
"Jimmy spent quite some time racing karts and mx5 I believe. The Prage championship is built in a way so one driver has to be pro and another one is amateur. It might be that Jimmy's pro is very strong and/or other AMs were not as good as Jimmy and/or Jimmy could afford better mechanics and/or Jimmy is very talented naturally.  


And Super GT clearly says that sims are just games."
"Yep, there are many examples of sim racers doing well in real cars. The fundamentals are there in sim racing. You will obviously not have a perfect transfer of skill, so a sim racer would need to adapt and adjust to the real thing. Ultimately though, what you learn in sim is applicable."
Couldn't be further from the truth lol
Did you end up asking why? Was it a fear issue or could he just not figure out the car?
I 100% think I would expect the same performance drop off in real life. Care too much about my own mortality and bank balance.
"Well yeah, but expecting to perform as well in real life as in Iracing is an insanely high expectation to set.

In Iracing I can hop into the F4, send it to the ragged edge, throw it into corners with the rear end trying to kill me, catch it just right to get at bit of four wheel drift and hit the curbs like they owe me money.

You would be a raving lunatic to do that in real life, unless you've really worked your way up to it.

However, you could employ the same techniques learned in sim racing to get up to speed more quickly, and you would be much faster than anyone without any experience."
"Nonsense, I say. The fundamental dynamics are the same and inputs are pretty much the same. It's all about adapting to a car that feels different, has a more nuanced behavior and gives you a lot more information, whilst being pushed around by the g-forces. The techniques are the same.

I believe Suellio Almeida scored a podium after his first race weekend in Formula 4."
"They took Greger Huttu to Road Atlanta and he got within 3 seconds of the best, despite being sick in the car. Someone even mentioned he got a real instinct for driving. Greger didn't even have a drivers license. If that isn't skill transfer, then I don't know what is.

Of course you can't take the best sim racers to an F1 car and expect them to race wheel to wheel with F1 drivers. I don't think anyone has ever argued there's a full 1:1 transfer of skill between sim and real life."
"That's the main difference, and thing I hate most about sim. You can push it to 11/10ths without fear of repercussion. Moves that people make are moves that would never be made in real life situations."
THE MOST clever comment of all because why ? Simracers learn to drive quick by crashing and resetting all the time. Then they know what max speed a corner can be taken etc while IRL you need to learn the limit of the car and the max speed of corners WITHOUT crashing. And 1 more thing: Simracers have the most extreme crashes where IRL it would be 100% dead. IRL also have heavy crashes but still simracers crash too many times. It’s just mindset and the damn RESET button. 
"Vision is applicable in the real world and you can certainly get some useful information through the steering wheel (that's why you can see drivers searching for grip with their hands). More importantly though, you can actually develop a keen feel for what the car is doing, through sim racing. 

Case in point: Some time ago my dad was giving me a ride - I was in the passenger seat. I told him he should get the wheel alignment checked, because it felt like he was running too much toe out on the rear.

He had the wheel alignment checked, and... yes, he was running too much toe out on the rear. 

That's something I would never have picked up if it wasn't for sim racing."
"I saw some video of that ""F4 experience"" on Brands Hatch Indy, where one of the instructors said a 1:06 would be considered a good time. Tried that in Iracing and found it was kinda difficult to go that slow. Like, braking super early and only going half throttle was still 10 seconds quicker."
"It’s a 2001 Van Diemen Honda, I race it mostly in the FRP F1600 Series but I go up to Canada once in a while. 

Ask away!"
"Brand new they’re about 65-70k US, but I was speaking more generally. A big crash in an F1600 could be 20-30k but a small crash in a GTP car could be $300k"
"The weight transfer and the feeling of the tires setting up is HUGE, and I'm not sure can ever be replicated.

Definitely agree with all of your other points except the final one. For me, weekends at the track are some of my most memorable. The feeling in my mind and my body as we line up to go green cannot be replicated.

Racing side-by-side online is still fun as heck when you're going for half a lap or more, but doing it in the real world is the greatest feeling ever. The trust and camaraderie that is shared, often with a stranger or very distant acquaintance, is unmatched."
"I think he acknowledges that given the massive difference in IRL seat time, the drivers are very close to his time. He concludes that driving in the SIM has prepared the drivers better than expected."
"Come on man, they both clearly have some pace irl. It didn’t seem to me like they were carried at all. 

Every other team had a pro and an am too. It seems obvious to me that if you are particularly talented on the sim it’s going to give you at least a bit of a leg up over someone brand new to racing in general.

You really think it counts for that little? I learnt to drift on a sim, I know that’s different to racing. But didn’t know how to drift until I spent hours on ac dicking about, now I can slide confidently irl which proves to me some driving skills can carry over for sure."
"Right…

There are ppl who were mid/back-field mx-5 scca drivers at best…who picked up iRacing during 2nd year & came back 3rd year qualifying pole & winning events…

Seat time counts as long as the driving environment replicates irl driving forces. Adding D-Box for motion to any chassis is like $8k…unless iRacing in VR in absence of motion, seat time probably only equates to a halved experience ratio…still counts though either way"
"What he said tracks with what literally every real racer says that also drives in iRacing. iRacing is good for learning a track and not much else.

Edit: lmao. Butthurt iRicers thinking they can go hop in a gt4 and crush it because they played a game. Delusional. Morad’s video (top comment) essentially says what I said."
"Mmmm, copium"
"He had no idea, but he did say that he just exploits the sim for laptime and he can’t do that in real life."
Yeah I’m not arguing with that.
"Yes like I said there are cases where they will transfer but it's not universal. 

Honestly, anyone who thinks being good on an off the shelf sim immediately qualifies them to be a racing driver has either never driven a car or certainly never raced one.  They are not the same."
"I'm not downplaying the guy, but you just gave reasons as to why being quick on iracing doesn't mean you are quick in real life, like fitness, which was the question. He would have been quickest on the service by a mile. What a driving licence has to do with it, I don't know...The answer to the question, no matter how well the guy did, is no.

Ref the f1 example....right.....so you agree with me.....thats literally what I was pointing out. Again, answering the question, which would be no.

Not sure who you're arguing with."
Many race cars have power steering. How are you going find grip with such steering?
"Yeah, I would imagine it’s because the cars are rev limited to something ludicrous like 4000rpm. In my opinion it’s false advertising to call it an F4 experience when the cars are so severely kneecapped."
"Do you get any feedback on the brake pedal regarding how much slippage you are generating? Like, does it feel lighter when you lockup?"
That just shows how stupid expensive racing has gotten. I wouldn't have thought one of those cost more than $15K.
How long are your stints? I think part of my issue is that I’ve had to run 2 hours at a time and drive around issues (like warped rotors).
He constantly kept acknowledging that these drivers were clearly utilizing things learned in the sim vs those he has seen without sim experience. I doubt the person above was actually *listening* if they even watched the full video.
"I think with drifting it's a bit better when it comes to the sims.  


But I didn't say they were carried. I sugessted several options. Maybe they are just very talented."
"Sounds like that’s exactly what I said, isn’t it?"
"No one comes out of no-where, gets handed an SRO comp. license or fia class B, & is seen starting in GT America in few months…

If someone were to do that, they paid a substantial amount for solo license-auth sessions at a track day & probably invested money into the team they would be racing for, or outright bought the race car for the team…"
Man I love Reddit 🤣
Nobody thinks being good in a sim immediately qualifies them to be a racing driver. That's a complete straw man.
Greger was quick in real life. The question was if skills will transfer from Iracing to real life. They do. The question was not if the fastest guys on Iracing could compete in Formula 1. They can't.
"Um, by feel?"
"Yeah, definitely false advertising. Where I live (not the UK) you can get a two day license course for cheaper, where you drive a Formula Renault and get a national F3 license after completion. I would assume you get to drive the real thing without rev limiter, considering you get a real license. Haven't tried it myself though (I'm too big to fit in those cars)."
"No, but the steering does feel lighter."
"Yea, it’s pretty outrageous. But nobody buys brand new cars, I bought mine used for about half that. You can find older fords for around $15k but they might need a bit of work."
"30-35 minutes max for me to date, but ahh. See, I would love that. I kind of live for the misadventure lol.

Best example was having someone accidentally come up under my inside while scrubbing on our pace lap. I slammed into him, knocking him off track. He deeply apologized after, admitting that his helmet straw fell out, he looked down, and didn't see the pace slowing up. I drove the whole race with my RL pretty well out of alignment. Still minor overall, but it made for some excitement lol."
"Yeah, sometimes it's very fun."
There’s almost no feel. FWD race cars like TCR have absolutely empty steering wheel.
"Oof, going from nothing to an F3 license in two days feels like a huge leap. I would suggest borderline dangerous unless you already have a decent amount of real-world racing experience under your belt.

But yeah, definitely makes the Oulton Park and Brand’s Hatch F4 days look like a total scam."
Also on the straight or only when cornering?
"Power steering does not equal no feel. Some cars have shitty steering, yes, while others don't. Generally race cars will have much better steering feel than road cars, considering the suspension is much stiffer and not run on soft bushings."
"Aye, it seems like quite a big step going from a Formula Renault to an F3. But I guess they have proper tests, and you're unlikely to be sat in an F3 car if you're a hazard anyway. Granted, I don't know what the F3 races are like around here... maybe they're like bottom split Ferrari Challenge. :D"
"Well when you lock the wheels the tires produce less grip, so the steering is lighter. You won’t really feel it if you’re not turning the wheel though."
"I repeat – ""FWD race cars like TCR have absolutely empty steering wheel.""  


It's absolutely empty, nothing comes to the steering wheel."
Cool. So no difference to sim racing.
"Even if true, and it sure seems like utter bollocks, it's completely irrelevant.

I said you can get relevant information through the steering wheel, which is why you can see IRL drivers search for grip with their hands.

You brought in power steering. Power steering does not universally kill all steering feel. Steering feel is affected by factors like suspension geometry and components, tires, steering rack and the power steering unit.

Finding a car that lacks steering feel does not negate this.

Talking universally about FWD cars like that is pure nonsense. Whatever the TCR feels like I can't say, but it's irrelevant. Though onboards clearly show that it is indeed not absolutely empty."
"I’ve talked with a higher up iRacing employee, I’ve also worked in association with nitrocross as media and have some background on the situation. 

Basically iRacing is waiting for a deal with Nitro. There is no iRacing world championship anymore because the old ICE cars aren’t being ran anymore. So now iRacing needs the new license and scans to run Nitrocross cars. 

That’s the gist. Anything past that I can’t say because I don’t know. Don’t know what that timeline looks like or if it will even happen. Nitrocross is a very fragile series despite how much their promotion says they are killing it. Peacock deal ending hurt them and there are also a lot of moves on a higher level at nitro that a lot of people don’t agree with (see: deal with Rumble & management).

Personally I also ran RX for many seasons and at one point was 53 in the world in Division 1. I’ve ran many many laps of RX and have won a fair amount of races. Not the absolute fastest but I can beat 90% of the people on the service running RX. So I do have some vested stake in the matter. I’d love more content but I’ve been on a long break from it due to personal reasons."
I think they should start with adding tracks for the pro trucks first. The Pro trucks have only 4 tracks.
"Nobody races it lol 

You have a small business, 90% of your customers are using one product and 10% are using another product. Both require equal man power to develop. 

You only have enough people to focus on one or the other, which are you going to focus on?

And holdup, wasn’t there a major dirt refresh a few months ago?"
"Not enough people race officials. That doesn’t mean people don’t race RX however. 

I pretty much exclusively race RX. Those of us who love it race it plenty. Rookies and D class races go official basically every hour. D class is harder to find races on specific paid track however. The Beetle lite is far more forgiving and easier to handle than the full power GRC cars. 

Most racing in the full power cars is done exclusively in leagues rather than C and B class officials. I personally don’t touch C and B class because of the skill gap between the Lite car and the full power car. Tightly grouped standing starts that instantly transition to dirt mean that 1 person who doesn’t know what they are doing is probably going to end 3 other people’s 10 lap race. 

There needs to be a better ladder of cars that teach people how to drive dirt rather than dropping them in a WRX STI they have no business being in after 8 or so lites races."
"Tell you what them dirt trucks are the most fun I've had in a long time. I've never been slower in a car in my 30 years of sim racing, but they are fun!"
"I’m new to iRacing and I found rallycross the hardest of Road, Oval & Dirt Road to race.  I haven’t tried dirt oval.  To be honest it’s doubtful I’ll run another dirt event for a long while. I ran about 5 races,   I didn’t find it fun at all."
"I've tried a couple times, but I just suck. I'm either involved in a wreck at the start or just circle around at the back.

Not fun, so I don't race it. I reckon this is a lot of people's experience."
"Just let us race the RX cars on tracks like Bark River and Crandon. Maybe add a joker somehow and it'll be a little like Nitro from a couple of years ago. Minimal development, maximum fun!"
"Yeah honestly as mentioned before, we, as the consumer, are the problem.  I've had an insane amount of fun racing rally cross on iracing but to be honest I don't race it because 90% of the time I try to race they can't get 4 other people to sign up to make the race official.  Why would iRacing spend their money scanning / creating additional tracks and cars when, in all likelyhood based on current participation, they won't sell enough to even cover the cost of making new tracks & cars."
Hopefully it makes a comeback. My favorite racing for sure.
Personally I love iRacing rally in any form. I'd love some new content. I also know other people that would drive Rally if it had more participation. Here's to hoping we see some new stuff and  some better participation.
"In reality no one cares I know it’s harsh, but the vast majority of community members don’t get excited for the dirt trucks or rally cross stuff, as with irl the trucks folded and no one cares about RX as well 🤷🏻‍♂️"
I don't think they have but realistically they have finite resources and a small percentage of users who race dirt road. From a business standpoint they can't put a ton of resources to dirt road.
hard no to nitrocross cars.  nobody wants to drive electric cars more than the first few weeks when they are first released.
You have my vote!
"In general real life RX has had trouble getting a footing. Makes it hard to really have partners to build up that side of things because everything is disjointed.

And if the user base isn’t embracing the existing RX content, is it worth the investment? iRacing puts their resources where the money is."
"Rally also has really good games dedicated to the sport, like RBR, Dirt, and WRC. While they don't focus on RX, people who are really into rally play these games, not iRacing."
Bc it stinks lll
I'd love more rallycross content. It's fun to take cars that have no business running on those tracks and see how long it takes me to completely be unable to move anymore
Let's do it!!!
"I don't know why they haven't added the stadium trucks in. That could scratch the truck and rallycross itch for so many, plus I know lots of road racers that would be up for it and would only take adding some jumps and changing truck gearing to do it"
"It all comes down to participation. If you enjoy it, join sessions."
"I'm pretty new and really enjoy jumping into RX if/when there are others signed up, which is somewhat of a rarity it seems."
Cross karts
"Part of it was the fact that it used to be Red Bull Rallycross, then that folded. So they had to change all the events. You had the drama with scott speed, then they just stopped adding tracks/content.  


The series died out IRL so it just happened to die out in the service. If they were able to get the FIA Rallycross, we'd be fucking set."
"From what you know, did it seem like there was movement on both sides to get it done?"
If only there was a superior rallycross championship…..
"Ummm... talk to World RX?

World RX > Nitrocross anyway"
That series folded IRL and one of the tracks we do have closed so good luck
Well if it means anything they have mentioned that [Wheatlands/Lucas Oil](https://youtu.be/U1_TCq_L9qg?si=DelxIENP_Q3TUrCu) is [scanned](https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/%20%2045765/midseason-dev-update-july-2023/p1) and will eventually be on the service. As to when though they haven't said.
"Seriously, and personally I think they are the most fun to race."
pretty sure that refresh was a dirt oval refresh. and not dirt road
"Would still rather have a new dirt track instead of yet another dirt oval hippy track nobody has ever heard of,  or a new car instead of BS like the mission R"
"As I understand it the dirt refresh didn’t make much change for rx, I certainly haven’t felt it in my experience. They drop like 5 tracks a year that a very select group purchase, slinger? Kern? Nobody was begging for that shit either. Maybe that’s a hot take but I’d much rather run rallycross than get punted at some short track I’ve never heard of"
"Considering I’m about to go test drive a wrx in real life this afternoon, I am delighted to learn there’s an Sti in iracing.

I will be crashing it all night now lol"
Can you share some info on the leagues?
"I know people won’t say it on here, but what helped me immensely to fall in love with RX is turning on the driving line. It’ll help to start to give you the feel, then turn it off again."
Yeah that’s the problem for me. I got up to about 3k  dirt road and then just got bored of the same couple of tracks. Bark River and Crandon look fun but I don’t want to race the trucks.
"I’ve got back to rallycross races recently and it’s really lots of fun. Especially since iRacing is the only sim in the market where you can compete it online with other people. I do few races in evenings (European time) and almost every race in rookie and D class are populated with 4-8 people. So it’s not that bad, but probably depends on timezone. For sure, participation is nothing compared to popular series, unfortunately."
“NOBODY WANTS TO DRIVE THEM SISSY GAS POWERD CARS” said the man on the horse
"Agreed. I'd much rather play Dirt Rally. I keep trying iRacing dirt rally but it just never feels fun. Maybe it's the FFB or maybe the physics, I dunno, but iRacing dirt feels the most like the old iceRacing meme."
I find it to be a fun test session if you just wanna screw around
Pretty much the same issue with the short course stuff. It was Lucas Oil Off-Road series tracks and then that series died.
FIA will unfortunately (probably) never happen that’s a conversation that has been had many times. And yes Redbull GRC ending hurt the continuation a bit
Honestly I'm not sure either series will do as well as we hope. Both have gone to electric cars IRL that hasn't been a big hit and I doubt it will be in sim.  The one thing Nitro would have going for it is the track layouts are so unique.
"There is an intention to get NX cars in the service but it’s a matter of getting the opportunity for both parties to get together and talk so it can get done. As far as I know they haven’t yet. 

Now my personal opinion is that I don’t see it happening for a while. Once Nitro proves its stability. But again that’s just me and it doesn’t reflect iRacing or Nitrocross opinions on the matter."
Pretty sure WRC just signed a big deal with EA.
"I don’t understand why it matters if the series folded irl. We pay for a video game service, just put them on other tracks they could theoretically race on"
Dirt was adjusted in general and benefited from some of the changes. 
"Just because you haven’t heard of it doesn’t mean it’s not popular 😂. Dirt oval has waaaaaay more players than RX. 

I think it’s a shame, RX is a blast, but it’s a business after all"
"Also pretty sure that the only reason we got the mission R is because porshe paid iRacing most, if not all, the cost to make the car because they wanted the car marketed.  If you can find a manufacture or someone to cover the cost to build tracks and cars I'm sure iRacing would be all over it."
More people race short track paved oval than RX. And Slinger especially is pretty famous.
"People were for definitely asking for those tracks. I'd love to see more dirt road love in general, but the IRL series aren't super popular, so it's not a surprise iRacinf isn't investing a lot into it."
iRacing is oval racing simulator game
Slinger and Kern was definitely something people wanted. Dirt ovals and paved short ovals are being ran way more than Rallycross. The world doesn’t revolve around you buddy.
"https://discord.gg/MBZnCWdSPR

And 

https://discord.gg/JramYybrBu

Both are US based. I know there are more that are euro and Aus centric but I don’t have the links to those."
"Honestly, hot lapping those two tracks in the big boy rally cars is about as much fun as you can have in sim imo"
"Yeah I can certainly do some of the rookie races.  My problem is after doing the B class series with heats and everything, it adds a lot more fun and really I'm just wishing those would go official as well but for some reason that series is dead."
"lol.  seriously though, look at rf2 and their formula e release. then their ex-zero.  then iracings mission r.   its all the same.  nobody wants to drive a car that only has one or two gears, you cant really hear, and the motor noise that you do hear gives you a migraine.  they all sold ok on release and were a ghost town a month or two later"
I mean they apparently built a whole SRX car and then the series closed down so idk if I’d say stability matters that much. (Assuming they’re still gonna release that car)
"No one runs the cars IRL for iRacing to scan

Plus they were quite unpopular after the first few weeks so not a lot of profit incentive"
"Mission R is actually a ton of fun, basically drives like a go kart"
"Costs may be covered, but not labour capacity, basically being used for content that's doomed to die"
"I’ve watched NASCAR my whole life, have been to hundreds of races at HKY motor speedway, North Wilks, I’d never heard of those tracks and I think that applies to most short tracks unless u live in the area or it’s truly iconic"
"Yes, I wish it would be more popular."
Licencing.  Even a dead series can still be locked in a legal quagmire. Last thing anyone wants is blood sucking lawyers that see an opportunity to sue.  They circle over the dead carcass of businesses looking for opportunities to feed.
"I was thinking they already have the models scanned for rallycross 

Participation i get tho. As I race my FR500s in unpopulated servers lol"
"Short course racing still has a series.  It's Amsoil Championship Off- Road.  They race mainly in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan and their schedule includes the crown jewel race at Crandon over Labor Day weekend."
"I'd love to race it, but rarely see the series go official.  TBH, i hot lapped a few laps the day it came out and haven't touched it since.  I need to put a bit more time in it to have an opinion LOL"
What an interesting rock you live under to have been an oval racing fan your whole life and have never heard of Slinger of all places. Guess we all find stuff out at different times but it's no exaggeration to say that Slinger hosts what's basically the late model equivalent to the Indianapolis 500 or Daytona 500.
"Slinger literally holds one of the biggest non-NASCAR stock car races in the country. Ty Majeski won last year.

Here’s just some notable drivers who raced at Slinger in 2023

- Ty Majeski
- Chase Elliott
- William Byron
- Erik Jones
- Matt Kenseth
- Johnny Sauter
- *shudders* Derek Kraus

Edit: it also hosted SRX while that was still a thing"
So you don’t pay the slightest attention to any non-NASCAR stuff outside your immediate local area. No wonder you have never heard of Slinger or Kern.
"You might forget that a decent amount of iRacing users are those that actually race local short track and want practice, not just fans of NASCAR. I wouldn't use iRacing if it didn't have the tracks I actually race at."
"Personally I want them to put in every single oval track that's in the country before i see another rally cross/off road truck track. And when I say every oval track in the country, I mean every oval track, dirt and asphalt."
"That's the freaking point. the majority player base likes short oval and would love it when their local track is added. Every time one is added, the reddit post is filled with locals, happy it was added. Those locals buy those tracks, and of course, the other short track runners so iracing makes money."
"As a lifetime NASCAR fan who grew up on my local short tracks, that's a lie. You have to live in a bubble to not have heard or pay attention to short track and dirt racing from around the country. Hell, just follow Kyle Larson's schedule and you'll discover tons of tracks and other racing."
Just admit you don't know shit dude
"I dunno about you but I've seen more people crying for more short tracks, even more specifically Slinger, than I've seen anyone even talk about dirt road, much less about what tracks they want. Lol

Also, I find it hilarious you complain about oval getting content over dirt road when the oval side gets nowhere near as much content as the road side of things."
I think if they made a for-fun stadium supertrucks series with the pro trucks it would be somewhat popular as a joke series
Yeah I just don’t see a problem with there not being a real life series equivalent but I do recognize I take the sim aspect less seriously than many
GPU. Budget will determine mileage
get a 4090.  it should be obvious.
"Get a 4090, but make sure your PSU is up to the task. If it is, it’s the easiest change too…and it’s what your current rig needs. 12700K will do fine in not bottlenecking the 4090."
Rtx 4090 says hello
"Both are a limit with triples. CPU more so at 1080p. gpu starts being way more of a bottleneck at 1440p. go look at dan suzukis iracing benchmarks to see this effect.  

i would start with a GPU as its cheaper and easier to get a 3080 or so vs a new CPU/motherboard. if you are deadset on maximizing FPS though, buy once cry once. save up and go big.

also, if you do upgrade your CPU, please go amd AM5 platform and not intel. you will have way better upgradability in the future and also AMD is just straight better right now.

 if you go to an UW then GPU 100%"
Gpu
id go with a gpu upgrade.  your system is pretty close to mine and mine runs good enough that i turned the fps display off so i would stop checking it.   i run the same processor but the K version which is a a little faster on multi threaded and a percentage point or three single threaded and a 12gb 3080 and 32gb ram
"a 4090 is easily bottlenecked by a 12700. not even close. a 13900k bottlenecks a 4090 in iracing. check out this dan suzuki benchmark video on the 7950x3d. his test setup is a 4090 with various cpus. he has 1440p triples results which will show LESS of a cpu bottleneck vs 1080p. 

[Dan Suzuki Iracing CPU Benchmarks w/ 4090 GPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ6u1kUD7kE&ab_channel=DanSuzuki)"
"I race in VR with a 4090 and 12700K, I’m bottlenecked by the 4090. Proven with numerous runs in CapFrameX and constant use of fpsVR."
"bro.... get out of here. Triples aren't VR. you are comparing apples to watermelon and ignoring hard evidence thats presented to you. Bad advice.

also, i know from running benches myself with a 3080 and 3700x/5800x/5800x3d on a 3080, there are tracks where those cpus are a bottleneck on a 3080 let alone a 4090. thats on a G2 with medium/high settings with 100SS."
"I’m not ignoring anything or disputing anything you said. Take a deep breath. I’m saying in VR, 4090 is bottlenecked and 12700K is not."
He’s twisting your melons man.
"your original insight was bad is all i am saying. the 12700 WILL bottleneck the 4090. Thats not to say the 4090 is a bad upgrade. far from it. On top of that, your perspective came from VR which is way different than triples. Your insight was wrong and irrelevant IMO."
Considering VR is even more cpu limited I very much doubt
"What card, headset and CPU do you use?"
"Because adjusting your car doesn’t fix bad cornering, bad braking, etc."
because an easy car to drive can be further from its performance limit
"For me, the hardest part in making a setup, is to understand if the problem is the car or me!"
"Stop investing time in setups, rather invest it in training, you are obviously way off the pace."
"Further, sometimes a fast setup is super hard to drive and sometimes a setup that's consistent and driver-friendly is a boat anchor."
I guess the smooth is fast goes only so far.
"I've been at it since like 7 this morning.  Ovals are easy to adjust, road courses I already struggle with but I keep the car on the track with sub par times. Vir is what I'm at for the touring series and I was at 2:01baseline high downforce and lost some to a 2:02 flat after falling to a high 2:02."
"That's about how you drive, not about the setup.

You only have to look at rbr with Max vs Checo. One of them can handle it, one of them can't. But there's no debate about whether the car is fast."
That's about driving style. A car that is difficult to drive can be much faster
"IDK it could be your driving if you already struggle.

I'm a road guy switching to ovals and I'm having a ton of problems with oval setups lol"
But is it really worth spending that much time on setup when people in the touring car fixed run around 4-5secs quicker. I would say no because that's not an amount of time you will find from setup
I had figured it translated through to a smooth car in turns would maintain speed better.
I mean I watch a lot of nascar so seeing how the cars behave and knowing the tracks so well I always keep up with minor tuning. In rookies mx5 once I got the hang of it I was competitive but I struggled in gt4 and surprisingly I am closer to the top guys in touring.  I had considered going back to gt4 and hover in the back to see what I can pick up. Unfortunately I liscenced up quick just surviving gt4 so I didn't learn what I probably needed to move forward.
"Nope, smooth inputs maintain speed but a car that's too easy to drive, well that's a car that's not rotating enough"
"Usually in gt cars I start from the fixed or the baseline, I move a bit the rake of the car and the wing depending on tracks (iracing setups are very conservative and understeery), I do some laps, and then play with ARBs to correct understeer and oversteer. If I have time I check dampers with motec.

When you drive try to optimize braking and corner entry to have the best exit possible and the faster speed in corner.

What should I do with fixed oval setups? They are also too conservative and tire saving, I'm a second off the pace in the first part of the race!"
"It's funny you say that, it felt like the adjustments made the car rotate better but it shows that was due to lower speeds. As soon as I reverted the car to a high downforce baseline I improved to a sub 2:01 and also can do the same with the mid downforce setup. Plus I have noticed a few other things about the cars rotation when I went back to square one."
"What is your pace like at 10 laps in and 20 laps in? I mean this is dependent on the track as some tracks love to eat tires.  Usually it takes 2-5 laps for the tires to get to temperature but on hard tracks you start losing a second after 10 laps or so.
Edit: it's crazy that in the truck series everyone loses a second or so in 10-20 laps at 30 seconds a lap and I can maintain my pace on a road course for 20 laps at vir at 2 minutes a lap."
"I'm racing next gen in autoclub. When I race open races with fixed setups, I'm 1 second slower for the first 20 laps, then I become a bit faster than others.  People start changing tires after 35-40 laps and I feel I could do the entire race with those tires! But I need to stop for fuel. It's too conservative and usually I finish races lapped by the leaders. I feel slow and not using the tires.

I don't know if it's my skill issue because I'm going great in fixed races."
"Once you go to open series you have to push your tires harder to get the most out of them. I try to adjust my transmission first to get the car running the fastest I can(I may adjust later as needed).  I'm still pretty new with motec so I'm on a learning curve but I will start with camber/toe and caster to get the right turn in/corner exit. Suspension is too complicated for me ATM to trust any major changes. I will play with ride height to ensure my front end is as low as possible.  A note with camber and toe is I try to balance my tire heat after a run to maximize tire patch. Once I get the car dialed in where I want it, I will take long runs to see where I am wearing my tires the most. 

The biggest part I have learned is once you get the car to roll properly through the turn then I try different racing lines to reduce tire wear as you will go through stints of running hard to pass and stints of tire maintenance. You also have to balance it with keeping up with the leaders so you don't end up off pace.  Sometimes I can make a car fast off the normal groove and net decent results. 

This is probably why I like learning to tune the cars. There is so much you can do with them. I just wish I didn't have to pay money to understand suspension as it is such a niche area. Dialing braking, easy, dialing camber and toe, easy...suspension rocket science.

To me oval is a feel when I tune it.
Plus you only have normally 2 to 4 segments to worry about. I feel like I have to be a nasa scientist to tune a car for the road since changing one thing can help turns 1,3 and 5 but hurt turns 10, 13 and 15. Phoenix raceway feels that way I
Since the turns are so different."
"Thanks for your help!

For road focus on turns that ends with big straights mainly, you make your time there.
But you need to drive that car fast and be comfortable with her. In fast circuits sometimes I'm not comfortable with my car, bit I need to go fast in straights (daytona for example)"
"The bad thing is, I just went back to the high downforce setup and my time reduced to a 2:00.5.  Each time I have to revert I learn a little more but I keep following the dragons tail almost every time."
"How are you connecting to your PC: link cable, airlink, or virtual desktop?

Did you already follow the iRacing VR guide?

https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/1185/iracing-vr-optimization-guide/p1"
"youtube iracing Quest 3, there's several breakdowns on this."
Have you looked at the renderdx11 files to see what iRacing has set your vram at? It’s supposed to be automatic but I think iRacing is still a touch conservative. So look at that and set it about 20% less than what you have. That can lead to blurry graphics in some cases.
I had the same issue and gave up. Have you found a solution?
"To be clear, *only* iRacing is blurry, nothing else?"
"Fiber optic usb-C to usb-c. If your computer doesn’t have an USB-C port, get a PCIe card."
"Ive tried all 3, link cable and virtual desktop were the best, but still issues, let me try this forum cause its not the same one I had used"
"Yep, done that, watched several videos at this point"
ill check that when I get the chance
I had HDR on and turning that off bumped my frames from 30 to 80ish. For quality I doubt out the with the Bobo VR strap I can take the little plastic piece off to see out the side and was able to move the headset more to get the lenses more in focus
"That's correct,  half Life Alyx looks amazing, os does fallout 4 vr, I was able to get iracing looking a bit better but still a bit blurry, finally got consistent 90fps though"
Use OculusTrayTool if you aren't already. Turn off ASW. Set SuperSampling to 1.5 (or lower) and set your encode bitrate to 500 and go up from there (mine is set to 600). In iRacing itself use OpenXR and make your settings match the one in the forums.
So you have tried the link cable and set the debug tool settings to at least 850Mbps?  Are you using the Meta branded link cable?
"My suggestion would be to try 72hz mode, to me it looks plenty smooth enough in my Q2 that i don't worry about 90hz at all."
Thank you
Yes and yes
I'll give that a shot tonight
"If you want, I can also put my settings in here if that doesn't help, though i'm running a Q2 in 72hz on a 3080ti/5600x/32gb ram."
You can if you want and I'll just Lower it a bit
Thats a Concord thing more than an oval thing. Concord speedway is a very hard track to get right and people will make mistakes. I struggled with it too
Concord and Arca is a 💩show - I turned some test laps earlier in the week and have avoided it like the plague ever since.
Try the Cars tour at 5 flags.
"Sounds like ARCA tbh. Not to say that people are dirty drivers, it's just the ARCA car is a huge step up from the street stock. Driving ARCA the way you drive street stocks doesn't work, and it take some people a little bit to figure that out. Plus keep in mind you have a lot of people who are not only new to ovals, but new to sim racing period trying to figure this thing out.

>Almost every single race someone shunts into the back of me coming into a corner

People driving in too hot, haven't figured out that corner exit is where you make passes. They are stuck in Forza mode trying to beat people on entry.

>cars on the inside will just stop turning mid corner 

Over driving the corner, get tight in the center, wash up the track, common rookie mistake.

>concord

It's one of the more unfortunate aspects of oval racing that doesn't really go away, getting good short track racing is really hard. Good short track racing requires a lot of finesse in stock cars, and a lot of patience, 2 things which are not is as great supply as one would like. Higher splits can have really good races on short tracks, but it can just as easily turn into wreck fests.

ARCA is almost a rite of passage for oval racing, it almost feels like intentional hazing by iracing at times. There's a reason ARCA memes exist. My advice is just keep at it. If your racecraft is there, you will advance and get to higher splits with better drivers"
It's a Concord problem.
Short track racing is a whole beast of its own. Personally I don’t enjoy it at all.
"ARCA at short tracks is a nightmare.  Too much power for most people in a car that the rear wheels come off the ground if you get bumped from the rear.  Combine the classic ""ARCA brakes"" with a short track or road course and you're gonna have a bad time.

As a newbie to oval, I'd recommend you run ARCA on intermediate tracks (mile and a half ""cookie cutter"" tracks) as you'll have a much better time.  You don't need to use brakes, which eliminates half the problem, and the cars really don't have that much power, so there will be less people randomly spinning out in front of you.  Avoid the short tracks, though, until you get comfortable with dodging through what amounts to a destruction derby.

Oval racing is extremely enjoyable, but your luck has you starting off on one of the worst car/track combinations imaginable for a newbie."
"Short track and ARCA don’t always mix super well. Especially concord.

Probably is some stuff you could improve on, but I wouldn’t stress it too much. It gets better when you move into the trucks."
Short tracks get a lot better once you go to C and get cautions.
It's pretty dirty and a lot of the drivers act like children
"I went straight from street stock to next gen. It's definitely a big leap but I have racing experience IRL so figured it wouldn't be impossible. I'm a road racing guy so didn't feel like doing the ladder. I'm sure I didn't do myself any favors but oh well. 

The point of this is that from what you're saying and based on my experience, I feel like next gen stuff is cleaner. We have cautions during the race but all of the incidents I saw were at predictable places where accidents happen. And I'm 1.5-1.7k. 

That being said, if you're below 1.4k split that's going to be a shitshow regardless of the discipline, car or track."
"At least in my experience the ARCA car is kind of deceptively difficult. It gets harder to drive further in the stint when you use the tires up. I don't think oval drivers are necessarily dirtier but the one major difference IMO is that people don't practice enough on the oval side. 

I have the habit from mostly doing road racing that whenever I'm in an official race I have done a full race stint in practice at least once but it seems that people on the oval side don't do that nearly enough so the car's changes come as a surprise."
I ran a B-Fixed race last night at Nashville Superspeedway that went caution-free. There's good racing to be had on ovals but ARCA and trucks are usually rough.
"Short track in cars made for it (Modifieds and Late Models) is much better than ARCA, don't write it off until you've tried those."
thanks for the advice
I have and it’s not something I really like honestly.  Very hard to pass at most short tracks and I seem to rack up incidents. I’m much better at intermediate tracks which I prefer
Focusing on racing late models for a few years has made me feel like a total wheelman when I go race enascar. A lot of people racing enascar can't run tracks where they need to brake every lap and the late model will teach you how to run a short track properly. It's good development to focus on short track racing for a bit
Ok you’ve convinced me to give it another shot. Is it crazy to start w super lates?  I have all the oval cars pretty much and these seem populated more than the modified
"They will be hard to drive fast but the update that they got made them great cars. The lmsc is low on power and a momentum car, the slm is light weight and high horsepower bumpstop car so you will need to learn to be comfortable trail braking and handling a loose car. It's my favorite car very challenging but very rewarding"
Ok perfect. That sounds right up my alley.

\~$400 but it's was also my first year on the service. Definitely won't hit anywhere near that this year.
"None of my own money. Just the iraing dollars I earned thru iracing funds. Im at the point i can keep current using iracing dollars. As for previous years, too much.."
Dont know and probably will never check. What i dont know doesnt hurt me
I calculated somewhere in the region of five to six million euro.
A little over $600. This has been my first year on the service though so I’ve bought many new cars and tracks to be able to race consistently in my chosen series.
Much less than a weekend at a real race track costs.
"About 600$ with my first year, I didn't expect to love oval, I had to buy more tracks"
That's like asking a woman her age or someone how much they make at their job...
Just the monthly sub. So $150ish. Have most the tracks for the cars I do. So after upfront costs it’s a steal for quality of entertainment!
"$499.25, but it was my first year in iRacing.

For ""2023"" I am quantifying it as cars and track purchased from start of S1 2023 through the start of S1 2024. 34 items, mostly tracks as I think I only bought 7 or so cars. many of those tracks I haven't even tried yet...bought them for the ""upcoming season schedule"" and then never even touched iRacing in that given week or weeks."
The equivalent to 4 tanks of gas.
"$220. It was my second year in sim, probably half as much as last year."
"$80 roughly. Could be worse, could be better."
"I think I bought 3 cars with 40% discount.

I wanted to grab some tracks, but I'm not good at the ones I have now, so learning more new tracks at to be bad seemed like a bit much."
$126.36. Also joined 100% club last year
"180 on subscription and 50 on content.

Since 2014? I don't want to know."
"$25.66

I'm half way through my 5th year on the service.

I own every road course, or oval that has a road course layout, on the service. Have purchased a total of 4 cars."
$374.74
To much ?
"I spent around 700, I new here, so I need to buy a lot. For example, my friend tell me to try NASCAR and... I bought whole 2023 NiS season, and I'm already road racer and live endurance and special events.

But good news, on 2024 NiS I will not spend my money (I hope)."
"Not much, but I was 100% at one time, now I just pick up most of the road course stuff."
I've been on the service for a year and a half and I'm well-clear of the 40+ piece discount.
"I started in March and about June I reached the 40 piece discount! I know my spend rate was similar after the discount till now, so I refuse to do these calculations. I’m having fun. Been a lil frustrating lately though tho I have to say. I came here for something different ( higher driving standards) I seem to have lost the chat / people / connections, from ACC and Xbox, and gained increased frustration.:( Let’s see hay today brings"
"Too much, though I’m new to Iracing and had to buy both a rig and PC."
A little over $6k
About $900 CAD excluding subscription…
Maybe $10. But only because I spent hundreds each year for the first 2-3.
"$152.52 (plus 158 for 2 year Black Friday subscription). 

I did spend $450 back in 2022 to get the majority of content."

Around 80$, last year was around 300$ and my first year was around 600$"
$767.66
"I got a 1 year sub for 15usd last november, and for cars and tracks I spent like ~50usd or so, I'm poor :("
"A little under $250, about 6 cars and 10 tracks. Definitely didn’t need all those cars but too late now"
"Same as the last 10 years, about 35-40$."
"What is spent in iracing, stays in iracing!"
About €200 I think
All the money. Just all of it
"About $250 and still mainly raced the Mx-5 but practiced new tracks / cars very few races in the stuff I bought lol, only 2nd season"
"$4-500, hobbies cost money 👍🏼"
"£21.59 for an annual subscription via Steam on the 28th Dec. I'm rubbish, but enjoying it so far. Still to buy any additional content, wouldn't know where to start."
Around $200
Not a penny. Though if I had a bigger budget I might've gotten a PC and then started going into debt pretty quickly
My wife knows about the new monza r5 bundle but she doesn’t know about the iracing bill. lol
Probably only ~50 bucks but I was already in the 40 piece club and had a 2 year black friday sub.
Heaps
A lot because I finally got the valve index and DD1 lol
You have to use real money to buy cars?…and tracks?
I don’t want to know 😂
Just started this year. Around $700
Are there ever sales on cars and tracks?
You trying to get us in trouble?
Stopped counting. I make good money and I’m responsible in everything. It’s ok to spoil myself for my hobby. Still reasonable though so no motion rigs for now
"200, i lease all road and 3/4 ovals, most stuff i dont use but i love having the choice"
Too much and not enough.
"$637 Australian Dollars in 2023. Probably around $1,400 since I signed up in June 2022. I own most of the cars and tracks I use, so I'm hoping the yearly expenditure will go down from now on. Also I get the discount for owning more than 40 items, which is quite nice.

Unless the drop new GT3 cars which are the only ones I drive, or some tracks I really want to race. At this stage on my wishlist there are only Mugello and Portimao which looks like will be released soon. My dream is that one day they will be also able to scan Albert Park, I would instantly buy it if it ever happens.

Although I hear Corvette and Mustang GT3 are eventually coming too.

My current expenditure per race sits around ~$6/race or around $0.40/race lap if we don't account for the insane amount of money I spent to upgrade PC and buy the rig.

As for the wife issue, I am a baker and I started baking chocolate chip buns and fruit buns early in my iRacing career to finance my expenses, it added extra income and it was enough to justify all the money I have spent so far."
I dont know but mother wasnt happy
25€ for the steam sale on the first year
"The only things I bought last year were:

Caddy GTP, Porsche GT3 update, Zandvoort, Ferrari GT3 update, Super Formula, and my subscription during black friday.

In total around $134 with $88 of that being the subscription"
About $30. Bought one new Porsche and 4 legacy. Didn't know at the time I couldn't use them in official races.
$99 for new driver 2 year subscription. Maybe $100-150 on cars/tracks so far.
"Not much, I believe 100 USD, I spend a lot more in my first year"
Yes
Just shy of $400 Canadian for this season. I decided I might as well just pick up all the remaining most rotated tracks. This is separate from annual membership. I hit the 40 piece discount so now anything moving forward is 20% off. Sim racing is my main hobby so they’ll get plenty of use. For reference I pretty much exclusively race GR86 and GT4.
"I don't know, but definitely less than I'd spend going out in my 20s."
About $150 I think. I bought a single track then a 6 pack and 3 pack
Don’t even want to know
"$100 - Second year, I do mostly Oval league racing but dabble in Road As well."
"Like $30? It takes like $120 to have 100% of the dirt content, so I only have to pay for the 2x a year they throw dirt oval a bone with something new and / or if I get bored and decide I need to spend the $8 they give me each season on something and go buy an oval track or car I won't use, but can't resist getting 3 things for the discount"
It'd be easier to tell you how much I didn't spend. 
Too much! Lol
"$22.49/year subscription
$31.90 on content"
Who sent you? Was it my wife?
"About 900aud, 200 for 2 years and the rest on car and tracks in my first 2 months if iracing"
"Whatever it is, it’s cheap comparing to most other type adult hobby, fpv drone racing for example, I was in for 10k first year, let’s not start taking about others like drinking, gambling, side chick 🤟🤟"
"PCars: Clio, Audi, Porsche, Ferrari GT3
Tracks: Jerez, Mugello, Willow Springs, and Ledenon

I was very behaved last year"
Put it this way. I currently own more cars and tracks than I have left to purchase. AKA too damn much and I started back up with iRacing in December.
Too much
"I don't really wanna know but I had to check. 
~850$ granted 2023 was my 2nd year in iracing so I had to purchase quite a few tracks and stuff. But going forward there will be much less, i already have what i need now"
"4th year in the service, $39, but it could be less. I bought 3 cars that i'm not driving :-(, and three tracks, Aragon, Jerez and Mugello.
I also bought the Ferrari 296 GT3.
I'm a proud member of the 40+ piece club, which my wife doesn't need to know that exists. 

Apart of that I have renewed the subscription for two years with the BF promotion."
"14,99"
"2023 I spent about 150 dollars, plus taxes. This year it will probably be double that as I gravitate towards the gt3"
I'm now in the sim for a little over a year and spent in total of 1.1K now. Recalculated a week ago and i was almost puking of it 🤣😭
"Around 50$ for new content. I ""own"" almost everything for paved road and oval"
"Not including sub, about $43. If you were to put my purchases over the years on a chart, it would look like my SR after running a week of Martinsville."
"Around $1k per year in content. Please don’t ask more because it hurts. 

Now I’m in a position that I only buy new stuff and I gave up on oval racing altogether in 2024 so I don’t have to purchase all the oval tracks."
Bout' three fiddy
"230x4 = 920.

I do have every track in the game bar 2 and have 13 cars left so that spending will soon go down and down and down"
"2023 was the most affordable yet.  My 5th year on the service and I bet I didn't spend even $100 on cars and tracks last year.  


Nevermind the 100 pieces of content I've bought prior.  "
~$100 over a year
Nope. Not gonna look.
"$0.  It was my 5th year on the service. Other than the membership fee I didn't spend a dime. And that includes hardware. It was a year low for participatiuon for me though...

2023 races: 93

2022 races: 174

2021 races: 285

2020 races: 406

2019 races: 128 (partial yerar)"
At least $400 USD which is like 2 million of my native dolaridoos. I get the 20% discount now though which is nice.
"I got a three month trial. Bought a handful of cars and tracks that I liked but really didn’t have an understand of series and cars/classes. This was in May, I think. Before Christmas I had reached the 40 item discount mark…"
"Yikes, £430
To be fair though, it was my first full year. I only had 1 month the year before, and I'm in the position now where I've got most of the core tracks that I'm interested in and at least 1 car in the series I'm likely to race, so upkeep is likely to be low going forwards."
Last year was zero and I compete every week
"How to be a man lessons

1: W- Do you need that car/track?

M- No but I'm buying it anyway. Still cheaper and safer than prostitute."
"A few years ago my wife asked if I really needed that new car and I replied with a ""no, not really.""

But...she likes clothes, and when she showed me a dress she wanted to buy online a couple days later I replied with ""nice, but do you really need it?"" Hahaha.

After a few moments she realized that she spends more on clothes and shoes per month then I do on iracing, and then said ""that new car, doesn't it also need a track to drive around?""
 
So we both spend too much now....."
“oh I might just buy these tracks for the week they’re only a pound”
same
This
Co-signed
i'm intentionally being as vague as possible about how I acquire new cars and tracks. She thinks I unlock the cars but buy the tracks. She does not know how much each are.... yet...
"I think I’m about the same, was my first year and I dabbled in lots of series, so I have a handful of cars and tracks to run whatever series I want now. Likely won’t buy more than a few tracks a year now and maybe a car if I really like it. Year one is the hardest hit."
Same here.
"I’m almost to that point, don’t know whether to be proud as I’ll get another trophy from iRacing (lol) or disappointed in myself😂😭"
What is this iRacing fund thing you speak of
Do I have to sign up for this ?
How so?
This is the best way to approach sims and pc gaming in general
First year?
"I’m in the same spot.  I did rookies a couple of years back during Covid and just stuck with the Mazda Mx5 Cup. 

Got a direct drive wheel and started by subscription back up. Now have a class c and I’m tipping my toe in the water in some other series."
"Iracing really need to make us pay for tyres, fuel, pit fees, transport costs, damage, safety apparel, spotter fees, engine rebuilds, entry fee, protests to make it more iMhERSHiVe."
"The greatest answer, ooof. 💸"
"Sigh, track days aren't the expense, it's the fucking brakes and tyres gone after one day of full send"
"I have really enjoyed the handful of oval races I've done, I think I'll probably do a series next season, looks like I'm gonna have to buy a lot of tracks to race some of them!"
That’s so 1973
What is the 100% club?
Which cars?
Nothing. I own so much and with the discounts and participation credits I’m covered.
How did you decide on which tracks to buy? That is the dilemma I’m having.
lol you’re safe here my friend
That is included sub tho. So 750$ without
"Lol the ""doesn't that car need a track to drive on"" redirect game is 10/10"
"Look, pick your battles hehe"
That’s the strategy my friend. My wife will blow A$100 on an evening out with the girlfriends. Four hours and done. Same amount spent on iRacing: if I pick my cars and tracks well I’ll be still using the cars for about two years and the tracks for as long as iRacing lasts or I’m alive!
"I convinced my wife her Sentra wasn’t cutting it, took her a minute to get her in a golf r…told her it was her car, now that we have kids…it’s my track car pretty much, I did not plan it…"
Just... Don't get yourself too much into credit card debt man...
This guy gets it
"yea it was 4, worked out at a pound a week thats what I meant?  


No I dont use them every week, only for one week, yea you're right i am stupid."
"Lol the truth is out!

![gif](giphy|3ohzdRgNgfodKmeXrq|downsized)"
What series did you enjoy the most and stick with meow
"Series that are above rookie give you credits if you complete at least 8 races per season. Max money you can get it 10 bucks per season.

https://www.iracing.com/race-participation-credit-program/"
"Sorta, you have to participate. 

https://www.iracing.com/race-participation-credit-program/"
"No, I believe that he is referring to the participation credits that iracing offers for each season. 

Running and completing 50% of the laps ina a race for 8 of the twelve weeks in d or c class will get ~4$. Doing the same for b or a class is a higher amount, but the overall payout is capped at 10$ per season. For a max of 40$ in free iracing credits each year"
https://www.iracing.com/race-participation-credit-program/
First week mate
"Yes, they should create a series where 1 incident point costs you $1. And disqualify you when your account runs dry. It would get very interesting very quickly :D"
Get a lighter car and they will pay much longer. Still expensive though
Owning all iracing content
"Audi RS 3 LMS, BMW M4 GT3, BMW M4 GT4, and Hyundai Elantra N TC"

"No worries man, I don't even have a credit card.

We now have a system, both of us put the same amount of money on a third bank account, from this account we pay all the bills and food etc.
Then we deposit both an amount on a 4th account for savings.
The remaining of our salary is our play money so to speak, we can spend it how we like without getting into trouble,  this works out really well I can tell you."
what’s with the meow at the end
idk if this was for me or u/Stealth9er but I drove a lot of GR Buttkicker until I got my B license. Tried GT3 and then moved to Super Formula. Pretty much haven't touched anything else since I got my A license.
"I think I’ve had the most fun in GT4 & the dirt trucks. I’m racing GT3 now, it’s fast and fun, but I like the feel of GT4 racing more.

Oval racing was addicting at first, but I’ve slowly moved away from it. Truck series is fun now and then.

Overall I think I’ve raced dirt trucks the most. You only need a few tracks outside rookies so it’s cheap, only one purchase for two trucks I think also. The races are pretty quick for the most part so it’s easy to jump on and race. 

I want to try the super formula also, I have heard that’s a lot of fun."
Wow. This is great news for me lol
Sweet =) now that's for a grind
Wow how long did it take you to obtain it all?
How much was it?
![gif](giphy|9XgsICKBa8jXG)
10 bucks per season is not even a car every 3 months. It’s not bad but definitely nowhere near enough if you want to race regularly in the series you enjoy.
I've been on iracing for a little over 3 years
Eh it’s buys me a piece of content free every season with the 40 pieces discount.
"I need to get the 40 pieces discount, the more tracks I buy now brings the discount closer so in theory I'm saving money if I buy more tracks."
Also buy in bundles of 3 or 5 for extra discount
Congrats. Just FYI though - it's trivial to find your race results and your name. So you may as well not bother editing your name.
"congrats.

I drive for 2 years now at 2.5k irating. I only have one win ;)"
"Nice, what did you do differently and how long have you been racing bud?"
"Yes, eventually, your IR will get so low you can smash the other window lickers!! 

Probably...."
Nice work
Great job! Wishing you many more to come! 🥇
It’s my government name and is pretty unique.  I’d prefer anonymity if there is a shred of possibility.
"I’ve been racing for 3 months.  My safety rating SUFFERED in my desk clamp days.  Maybe I should reset my account..

Anyway..  my strategy now is to carefully qualify the best I can and be DEFENSIVE in the first lap.  When the fools crash out, there will be space for your hot laps."
Nah what he's saying is he could go look up that race right now and find your name 
Sure Fred think what you want
It’s funny that you don’t care for the other people.
"This is a good video on race craft and how to rise up through the ranks in the Vee if you’re remotely interested. 

https://youtu.be/VXVBPLSIlds?si=WvrdXVCSxj0ob-GR"
Yup. David. F won on the Jan 25 18:45 split.
Indeed.   But that would require a subscription to iRacing.  Bots that scan public Internet data data don’t have access to the application data.
"I am much more than remotely interested.  Vee has been a blast and I want to get better.  

I certainly appreciate you."
"Bots are less likely to do text image recognition. Humans, however, will find your LinkedIn profile in about 30 seconds."
It's a lot easier than you think it is. I literally found the race you won in about 15 seconds.
Sure buddy
"No problem. At all, he also does weekly track guides."
"For some reason, mu's lap time export doesn't often show the correct time in the i2 Load Preview until you've loaded a file once.  Use shift+click to import them all at once.  Then do ""Close All Log Files"" then go back to the load menu and you'll see accurate best laps."

"Drivers who can't drive straight shouldn't be trying to go 4 wide. You were unlucky to get collected, though with a clear incident happening on your right I would have moved as far left as possible rather than staying in the middle like you did. You probably would have survived."
"Yeah if I see a 4 wide in front of me I'm backing off. Something like that is going to happen and you want to take advantage of it, not be collected by it."
"Or back off a few car lengths to give him some visibility of what is inevitably going to end in a crash.

4 wide in front of me and my thought isn't ""move closer"" but is ""oh this is going to be entertaining""."
From my view in the car it looked like I was clear once they crashed right.
"Move anyway. With ricochet and net code, always err on caution man. Preservation."
"I’d say doing time trails to get your licence is not a great idea. Getting race laps under your belt is the best way to hone race craft and build your SR naturally. Joining official practice sessions and practicing with other cars on track is a good way to see how you’re tracking and test your reaction times while people eventually find their limits. I’ll only practice in test drive if I want to practice next week’s tracks earlier, otherwise I’m always in official practice.

If you like the tin tops the MX-5 Cup is the most popular road series this season resulting in lots of splits meaning more drivers of your skill level to practice against. The 86 is also a great car, we drove that in the NEC last season and we had a ball. Going by other Reddit iracers comments I read, the next step is typically GT4 maybe straight to GT3.

https://preview.redd.it/iv6qvysyfvec1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ed9e185731053abcfd492941eb41d9a573d3dbb

Personally, the F4 is my favourite series and car. It feels like a go-kart and the new regional series have been incredible racing. We also do the NEC cause it’s an enduro championship on the ring cause fuck yes. This season we’ll move to GT3 from the 86."
"The Formula Vee is possibly the slowest car on the service, but that doesn't mean it's no fun. It has severe lift-off oversteer, which catches you out at first but when you know how to use it for rotation it's a hoot. I highly recommend giving it a whirl before you jump into faster cars."
Whatever your heart desires!  What one person likes may not be what another likes.   Just race what you think you will enjoy.   And welcome to IRacing! :)
"Since you mentioned endurance racing, I’d recommend aiming for the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge. 2 hour, solo races held at specific times on alternating weekends, featuring GT4s and Touring Cars. Good for satisfying the endurance bug while still being manageable for just 1 driver. It’s a C class series, but at D class you can give the GT4s or Touring Cars a go and start working towards it.

Or, to suggest something completely different, if you enjoyed GPL, you’ll probably enjoy the Skip Barber. It can be a little harder to find close competition, but when you do it’s about as much fun as you can have on here.

That being said, there’s no need to rush through the ranks. iRacing is… very hard. If you’re enjoying the MX-5, maybe stick with it for a little while longer, hammer out some more races and build up confidence. Maybe sample some of the other free cars on the service to see if there is any type of car you click with."
"Thanks for the reply.  I know I'm still a country mile off the pace (1:54 Oulton mx5) and I'm trying out different car/track combos to get a feel for car dynamics and track limits, braking areas, early and late corner entry lines, so I can be safe out there and don't fuck up someone else's race.  Don't think I have a preference yet for open wheel v tin top and downforce v none. 

I tried the time trial twice, got interrupted the first time, and I've done two races. I was just checking how things basically work and expected to have to do more to qualify for D. 

The MX-5 is fun to drive and race, and I'll check out the 86 and F4 too, thanks for the steer!"
I did a handful of laps and didn't get to grips with it. I should give it a fairer length of seat time.
Thank you.  I'm loving it so far.  Trying tracks I haven't been to is awesome.  :)
"Honestly just keep doing laps and until you learn it.  I know that doesn't sound cool or different but it is what it is.  I like to just start from the beginning.  Everytime you crash or get back to the start just keep adding to it.  Eventually you get to the end. 

A lot of the track is very distinct which helps.  Its  like a big open flat GP track where every corner could look the same from the start.  Most corners have a lot going on, so to me its easy to identify and remember after a while.

Don't get me wrong...its going to take a while."
A slow car and active reset is your friend
"This video series is great to learn it. It breaks it down into much more manageable sections.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDgPIzXADRz4AjyqgocDeglVWF2MEezPU&si=2NZr75BOVY0peNmx

This plus an active reset should get you going."
"It doesn’t take long to learn the “dangerous” corners that put you in a wall if you don’t know they’re coming. You’ll learn every corner that requires braking, which really isn’t an overwhelming amount of them. Then you start remembering the sections around those corners. Honestly I don’t think it would take more than an hour or two to reliably navigate the track. Once you’ve got that down you start working on your line and that’s where the fun starts."
I literally just drove and drove and drove. It was so daunting at the start but eventually it just comes to you.
I’ve been learning it this week too and I’ve been breaking the track up into quarters and using active reset. Whole track at once was too much for  me to memorize
"Use the racing line at a minimum for this track — if anything just for the approximate braking points. There are many so it’s fine to use the line for a bit to memorize them. But with this track in particular, you’re way better off starting to learn the “flow” of the track and the way it’s shaped. The racing line can prevent you from learning how to actually read the track, which in this particular case will gain you 10-15 seconds a lap, not to mention the cool feeling of racing that track without assists!"
"I used Brad Philpot’s Learn the Nürburgring in under an hour series. Brad takes you around the track and explains the historical names of corners and places, or like interesting things that the locals talk about in places, so you associate those corners/sections with neat little tidbits of info. My 24 Hour team all used it too, so we must “smell the pizza” at Breidschied at least five times a race."
"I've been doing this too! I've owned the track for a few seasons but never felt inclined to dedicate the time to learn it. Last couple weeks I've been doing laps in test sessions (as well as watching lots of videos, also recommend the Brad Philpot series...) and eventually you get to the point where you know what turn is coming up and you can concentrate on shaving the tenths. I really don't much like hot lapping, I'm more about racing, but I'm really enjoing the process. I've been using the Ray FF as that's one of the cars I race. I'm down to 7:41 at this point, more to come!"
Use the active reset and learn the track a few miles at a time.  with this approach you can memorize it in about 2hrs.
"Do not learn corners, learn sections.  You’ll get the rhythm of each section down better by changing to that way of thinking.

Someone else mentioned Brad Philpots 5 part guide.  Watch it.  Doing some household chores? Bang it on an iPad and listen/watch as you do them.

If you’re thinking of doing NEC when the 2024 edition starts in season 2, get comfortable running the hotlap lines but then also practice different lines.  These new lines are just doing simple lifts, switchback lines (run deep come out tight) and most importantly sticking to one side to signal intent for a target passing corner."
[Here you go](https://youtu.be/WXJzt4bRWR8)
"Best way is to learn key land marks. There are really long sections that are full throttle in just about any car. When it’s new it just looks like a twisting noodle so not being sure when the next big slowdown is coming can be hard. 

I guarantee at some point you will forget about the existence of Bergwerk, thinking you’ve already settled in to the super fast bit running up to the Carousel."
I remember the first time I did 3 consecutive clean laps in a row. 2 was faster than 1 and 3 was faster than 2.  You’ll get there.
I learned it in “chunks”. Some sections stood out and were more memorable for me. They acted like little nodes that I could build out from there until I comfortably had it all committed to memory.
"I learned it by running a GT86 around assetto corsa for a good few hundred km, and even then Im quite sloppy through certain sectors"
"This is what I did recently. Thought I would never learn the Nords. Lost my A license and decided to drive Ring Meister to get it back. Started from the pits and just took my time around the track. After about 2 weeks or around 14 races later I found myself getting around easy and quick. Now I know it well, you just have to break down track into smaller chunks."
This is the way OP. This is an amazing series of videos to learn off.
My content > paint shop is where you can select the default liveries
"Trading Paints - it’s a website, free to use with a premium option. Have fun!"
Just use trading paint man
Do what the guy above said
You’re talking about a new project to believe in but didn’t specify anything about the project itself mate.
Sorry! As Scuderia Centro nord we are looking for young pilots who want to train and want to join us. in particular you need at least 3 to do the 12 hour mount panorama. this could be the first project
Daytona is pretty much a must have. Cant remember other combo tracks at the moment. Indianapolis also comes to mind
"No, because the number of configurations doesn't mean popularity.

You should buy if it's on the schedule for a series you race in.

Here is [a list of tracks by usage this season ](https://irpa.racestatcentral.com/tracks.php):

https://preview.redd.it/xhv76usudzec1.png?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5618b751ab03a8e8746e59c5698f19531ec61eef"
"Daytona, Indianapolis, Charlotte. Off the top of my head."
Is day any track that is heavily used in series or that you really enjoy are good deals.
"They might have 5 configurations, but they may only run 2 of them in the official races, leagues potentially could run some of the lesser used configurations."
I mean any track that has a road course and oval course are usually pretty good deals. The tracks with the most uses for each variation are probably Daytona and Motegi.
"As far as schedule goes, you should have an idea of what type of car/series you’re going to/want to run. Once you have that, use this website to plan ahead: 

https://iracing-week-planner.tmo.lol/

You can sort it by class, discipline, etc. Do remember that there are discount when you buy in bulk as well!"
Great website. I didn’t know this existed!
"Charlotte is an amazing deal, considering it’s included in the subscription :D"
"That was no where near gently, it actually looks like you sped up into the wall"
"Look man I don’t mean to be a jerk and I generally dislike the whole “Google it” response but…

I mean; what did it say when you googled “trading paints subscription?”

Or how about when you went to their website and clicked on “pricing?”

If you’d done either of those things you’d see it’s US$23.99 a year for the pro version; but you can race liveries from the showroom for free."
"JFC dude. Does someone have to periodically remind you to breathe?

If only there was some way to find this information…"
Sim stamped paints are free. Pro for custom numbered paints is $25/yr
Lacy git
"It’s constant, and it’s free"
There is a pro version that I assume OP is asking about.
"Oh, lol, that makes more sense"
"I don't think You'll ever see any response to these posts on here other then some version of ""you are responsible for your own incidents"" . Everyone else gets out of rookies fine in the same conditions. The best way to improve is to realise you are the common factor"
Somehow everyone else is able to make it out of rookies and gain SR…
![gif](giphy|wMvESGxZ0Cqd2)
"It’s not 4x per incident. It’s 1x per off track, 2x per loss of control and per minor contact, and 4x per major contact. If you’re wracking up 4x’s perhaps understand what that might imply and adjust your style accordingly."
It's 4 incidents per contact. If you're making contact heavy enough to get a 4x 4 times a race I think safety rating loss would be the least of your worries.
"If they made it any easier to get promotions, there wouldn’t be any point having a licence system. It’s supposed to keep drivers who can’t drive safely out of higher classes. 

A lot of people would argue it should be harder, not easier."
You are the crayon eater if you don't think that it's enough wiggle room.
I used to think the same thing. Until I went back on a smurf account and raced some rookie series (as a rookie). It was shockingly easy to avoid incidents after I had some experience under my belt.
"Not recognizing the random luck factor involved in avoiding accidents is not taken into consideration very much here. I raced in rookies to race. I qualified as high as I could and raced, period. Obviously, some of those splits are such a shit show that whoever wins is just who survived carnage. I also was in more fairly clean races than not. It just makes sense that some people got out of rookies and saw way less horrible driving than others. It's random. All that to say hang in there, all of us went through it to some degree"
A better question is why is it 1x per offtrack. That’s more egregious
"The 4x per collision will teach you wreck avoidance. No matter what level of racing you're at, there will be wrecks and dangerous behaviors from others and if you don't have the skills to keep yourself safe and avoid wrecks, you'll never make it.

It sucks to hear, but it really is a matter of skill. You'll get out of rookies as you get better."
"yeah, I get that and I know the sim can't adjudicate on the spot ""who is at fault"". Just seems like it will be tough to get out of rookie...but I will be a better driver for it (if you get what i am saying)."
I mean minor contacts are 0x not 2x.
"i don't see in my original post anything about me getting 4x, 4 times a race...
Last race I was in, someone ran up behind me on a straightaway and I got 4 incident count point or whatever they are called. from one collision?"
Just don’t leave the racing surface while racing
Because we can’t have nice things
"Reading a live circuit and figuring out who will crash themselves out, or finding the safest way around someone is probably the top skills rookies is supposed to teach IMO so yeah just keep at it"
"Its all pretty lenient down there honestly, you only need a 20 cpi to get out of rookies.

Now theres a few  schools of tought considering rookies really, people will tell you that its the class to learn to race against people etc. The downside of Rookies is, that it only teaches you how to survive against people who cant race.  
I think its more a safety buffer to keep the really bad ones from the service. Making it a hurdle every iracer has to pass so to say, before we are allowed to mix with the general population.  


Anyway, ive included a handy chart that makes it alot more obvious how SR actually works.   


Your SR is a reflection of your Corners Per Incident, as you increase or decrease that rating your license rating basicly slides along the horizontal.  


https://preview.redd.it/jizktar8y5fc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b251c4e4e8ebf5eea2d548d4ff40a376b848337"
"Yeah man honestly it goes against the idea of racing but in rookies safety rating is all that matters. Just circulate avoiding people, get your d licence and move on. once you have an irating high enough to filter out the true rookies then go race in rookies if you really like a series."
Its like 4 clean races to get out of rookie. Just Focus a little on driving safely and youll get it in no time.
"Idk man, I just drove normally and got out in 2 races"
The whole point of the system is to teach people to drive cleaner to get out of rookies. It is totally intended to make you reflect and improve or stay in rookies.
I've never done oval but I think you can get 2x for light contact
"Yes. What should it be then? 1x for off track, 2x for light contact or a spin, 4x for heavy contact. I don’t know how you lower it and they did they would lower the limit from 17/25 to 1/4 or 1/2 of that."
Because no matter who is at fault there is still damage to your car
"Yes, 4x's suck. I'd guess in the 4 years I've been on, I've been a victim of a 4x  5 times as much as I've caused a 4x. You can choose to worry about it too much and let it affect how you race or just race the best you can. But also, you obviously have to also learn how to avoid the avoidable and that is an invaluable skill to work on."
"Yep. And it’s a skill that you never stop needing. It may come into play less in higher splits and licenses, but it still comes into play. What’s amazing to me is how many people manage to get out of rookies without having any hint of being able to read the track. All I can figure is that those folks farmed SR at the expense of iR, but there are plenty of people right around the 2k mark that seem to be lacking it too."
Only thing that i know of is wall contact can be either 0x or 2x. And on dirt heavy contact isn't 4x but 2x
you clearly know more than me so I'm gonna assume you're right lol
There's a nice table of it in the sporting code. Well aside from them having them switched around for pavement and dirt currently
Millbridge.
"Maybe dirt oval, dirt road looks like abandoned.

It looks like a race surface improvement, I hope it's not only graphical!"
iRacing super speedway dirt
Ben Hur chariot racing. 
The track prep marks seem to be new? Maybe just for this new track?
Looks super detailed. Ventura runs that similar chalk line too wish that was the track lol
East bay? (Please God!)
100% millbridge
It's teasing the microsprint they scanned a while back.
"Yep, it'd line up with that screenshot of Millbridge that iRacing showed back in November."
"Yep, thought the same thing, definitely looks like Millbridge turn 4"
"Dirt oval got a physics refresh at the beginning of 2023 Season 3. 


I think there's a pretty good chance this is graphical only, or just teasign a new track or something."
iRacing did say they're adding dirt road track at Wheatland (Lucas Oil Speedway on iRacing) pretty soon when they did that developer blog post a few months ago.
Dirt Rosd was also affected by the physics refresh. 
"Is that good? I'd love to reach A in every license, but I was reeeaally bad in dirt oval. I can't understand it"
I honestly haven't tried it myself. I do remember seeing feedback saying that the change was positive.
"I once bought tickets to Canadian Tire Motorsports park, with my Canadian Tire MasterCard and they triggered it as suspicious.

But none has ever had suspicions over iracing"
"I mean if you've never purchased similar things then yh, they'll send a confirmation"
"If you can login to iRacing you should be good. Maybe some background check flagged your purchase, nothing to worry about."
"Thank god you didn’t try to buy tickets to the Canadian Tire Canadian National Figure Skating Championships at the Canadian Tire Centre in your Canadian Tire MasterCard.

They’d have a cow."
Tire wear is probably the culprit.
"Tire wear is a different animal on ovals..I actually have great example of this.

Ran 60+ laps at homestead behind a guy in the silver crown cars. He putting a lot of effort into blocking me into the corners, putting stress on his tires. I purposely stayed behind him just riding the draft taking care of my tires..5 laps to go, I drove past him easily. 

Be nice to your tires..they’re delicate and don’t do well under stress"
Sounds like you’re driving the car too hard into the corner causing excessive wear on the front tires.
"Tyre wear is the issue. An easy solution is trailbraking into corners.

DJ Yee-j has loads of videos about it on youtube."
"You need to find a good balance between speed and you tire wear.  
This problem is because you drive to hard so try backing up the corner and adjusting your line to get a good tire conserving strategy."
"Learning how to get through the corners at max speed and with minimum steering is the kind of thing that comes with practice, if that’s what you’re asking. You just have to get more comfortable with the car."
Check out some YT videos on how to drive oval tracks.  DJ YeeJay has a number that are excellent.  Basically the goal is to turn the wheel as little as possible and use you feet and the banking to get the car to rotate.
Tire wear? They call it Sim for a reason
Hand over hand is bad. The older the tires the slower you have to go.
"It's called bald tires, look at your percentages after you pit."
You might be driving the whole corner on the front right tire. You want to try and balance the car in the corner to get it on the rear right on corner exit. Getting stuck on the front right you end up under steering more and more. Resulting in turning the the wheel more and more. Wearing the tire more and more. See if you can get it to be a little oversteery.
"Completely unrelated I don’t know how you use the Macca wheel in ovals.

Unless of course you’re doing open wheel cause I do the same. But I’ve messed with it in nascar and holy shit it’s a nightmare."
Keep this in mind on ovals - the more you turn the wheel the more tire wear.  Find the balance  of maximizing speed and minimal wheel turning as others have stated.
"What car/track?  It's 100% tire wear, just need a bit more info to help you out."
its called tire wear
"Tire wear, you need to stop asking so much of your front tires, I'd bet you aren't braking enough and are compensating by adding wheel throughout the corner.  Try to think about driving off of your right rear tire instead of your front right."
"You're using up the front tires. That's called understeer. 

Lift off on the gas."
"You're massively overheating the tires if you're hand over hand lol.

Mr ARCA Farmer has some Good vids on ovals. https://youtu.be/pASpcCYulAU"
It's the tire wear. Once you're at a comfortable pace you really never want to add in extra wheel if you're running the same line. That will just exponentially destroy your tires.
Yeah you have to steer with the brakes and throttle or else you’ll wear those fronts out ten laps in.
How’s the silver crown racing? I’ve always wanted to give those a shot
I read that as “silver clown cars” lol
"Squirrelly is best word I can think of. It Only has one gear, no built-in rear mirror And at higher speed, the back tires like to try to out run the front. Bigger tracks like auto club or homestead require you to really be throttle aware ALL the way thru a corner."
"""Well, I guess it's time for the joker"""
Haha that’s right!
"Bind second clutch to a button on the wheel, feather the throttle"
In SF I was doing fine just shifting into first and gassing it up on green.  Not as fast as clutch launch but far less error prone and almost 0 chance of spinning. 
turn on anti stall clutch put it in first and gas it on green
"I don't have a clutch pedal as well and spent a good three days testing ways to launch start. 

From testing, I found that being in N and revving at about 30% max rev and dumping it into first on green and rolling into the throttle gave me the best 100ft time."
"- Full brake
- Shift into first
- Half throttle
- Off brake when the lights are green
- Keep half throttle until you're almost in 2nd"
Neutral drops buddy
"I know this is stupid and uncomfortable but, when I was broke and couldn’t afford anything but a Logitech DFGT I mapped the clutch to a trigger in my old Xbox knockoff controller and it did the job perfectly fine"
"Do this trust me -> Shift to first hold brakes at around 80% then hold throttle around 20%, on green let go of brake and slowly push in the throttle"
Steering Wheel Paddles? Unless you're using a controller 🧐
"If you have on anti-stall clutch, the problem most people run into is that they start increasing throttle before the anti-stall clutch finishes doing its thing, so when the clutch drops out, they've got too much throttle in already. The little UI thingy that shows your speed/gear/throttle/brake/clutch/steering (whatever it's called) shows you when anti-stall clutch engages, so watch that and keep your throttle limited until after the anti-stall drops out."
Thank you for all the tips!
"SF has a launch control button too it limits revs, bind a button to that as well as the 2nd clutch and do half throttle in 1st and don't floor it until you shift to 2nd."
"Before the mx5 had a sequential gearbox everyone would try to optimize their revs for launch to get the best hole shot without wheelspin. I would put it into 1st and just hit the gas on green. Can't remember ever losing a position but I gained plenty.

Point is, try the simplest solution first."
"I used vjoy to create a 2nd clutch bite point - basically I would set the % clutch to the point where I floor in N, when lights go green I shift to first, and the bite point was enough to get a pretty good launch using a button. Just release the button when wheel spin is likely to not be an issue anymore - e.g once you get to 2nd gear"
I have this exact same issue. I was wondering how other people did it.
[deleted]
I do this every porsche cup race. It's slightly slower than someone who knows how to launch it properly. But that's usually only like 1 guy on the grid. lol
That took 3 days?
Assign a button to second brake for bonus points.
I only have shifter pedals unfortunately not sure that would work
"This, 0%. Dude ain't got a clutch pedal"
OP doesn't have a clutch pedal.
Can you read
I'm a big nerd and tested 8 different ways to start. Each scenario I recorded 50 times and put the times into a spreadsheet. Averaged the time out and picked the one with the best 100ft time.
Hahahaha!
What does this do?
"Oops, apparently not. Read 'I do have a clutch pedal'. My bad"
That work for Porsche cup? it was slow for me
It sets a keybind for second brake
"It can be hard to maintain 100% with the brake pedals, particularly if you have a loadcell brake, while applying throttle. Assigning a second brake button for starts ensures no jump starts when using this starting method."
"Unsure for Porsche cup but I did do the test on the Vee, FF1600, 296 GT3 and the GR86. 

All had the same results for me so I'd assume it works for the Porsche."
"for porsche cup I just shift into first, 100% throttle and brake, release brake when lights go out

I'm in lower splits cause I'm bad but that beats 95% of people off the line. 2-3 positions before T1 at spa, every time"
Well yeah but why
Ahhh gotcha thank you!
"Oops, in ff1600 I would just rev it all the way up in neutral and then shift into first when the lights go green, I’m gonna have to try this next time I race it."
Possible CPU throttle.  The more cars on track the more your CPU comes into action.
"GPU do not must be on 90% or more. GPU is doing what CPU ask. They have different tasks. CPU to busy preparing new frame that give GPU time to rest.
It's can be by different reasons. To many CPU tasks, CPU not enough powerful, game used not all power of CPU.

More about CPU and GPU in games you can understand by googling, this will help you better optimise options in all games and will make your experience better."
"Can we think that Rysen 5800X is not enough powerfull for iRacing but enough for Assetto Corsa Competizione?

I have test different settings for the CPU but without results.

Do you think there is a BIOS setting which can explain that CPU don't deliver his max power ?"
"What is your fps in solo test sessions? I think you may have vsync or a frame limiter turn on in iracing. The 5800x should be good for more than that, also the fact that its showing 59 fps. Remember there are two different graphics settings menus, one for driving and one for replays."
"Thanks for your support.

To answer your questions, I send you some screenshots. My settings don't limit frame rate, and this pictures are captured in live session to remove any ambiguity versus replay graphics settings.

"You need to lower the iracing's CPU heavy settings as you're CPU bottlenecked*,* do this and you will become GPU limited once it hit 98% utilization .  


AAC's is unreal engine more demanding on GPU hence pushing you GPU harder. The consoles, which unreal is designed and optimized for, have much weaker CPU power vs GPU on relativity strength hence it been designed this way, unlike iRacing."
Well done mate!
Let me know the next time you're trying to achieve a clean win. I'm sure you don't enjoy a race without someone taking you out in turn one for 5 minutes of repairs. 
Congrats man! Enjoy the iRating.
"This is how I got my first win in the Vee, well done."
Congrats!
"Yeah man that’s always brutal, especially when you’ve been practicing for an hour prior"
My first win was in the vee as well! Congrats! I’ve been religiously driving the mx5 lately
"Balanced the whole time, no need to run attack on the first lap. 

Balanced targets 50% SoC and will behave like attack until it hits that state. 

Attack will keep deploying until 0% SoC at which point you'll be fucked. If you switch to balanced at an SoC below 50% (if you run a full lap of nords on attack, you'll be at 0% for sure) then it will behave like build until you get back to 50%.

The time gained in attack is more than lost replenishing the battery as its more important to get up to speed quickly than to get a couple kph extra of VMax at the end of the straight. 

So just run balanced. Maybe use attack on the Döttinger on the last lap or on a lap where you really need to get by someone that's holding you up, then switch back to balanced out of Tiergarten."
IIRC you only get 2 mode changes a lap in GTP.  Leaving it at balanced should be fine (it's what my team did the entire D24)
Everyone always says “just leave it balanced” never heard from anyone that switched the battery up other than the last lap.
You'll have been slow because of the downforce levels on the setup. I had the exact same issue when I ran the Caddy yesterday. Even in attack and in the slip of a car in front I wasn't gaining any.
"Perfect explanation, thanks"
And this is why I run simple cars🤣
"Yes, but Nords is a completely different style track with massive uphill sections and probably more than 10x as long as daytona"
Or the BOP. Acuras have been dominating all week long
"Np, good luck"
It's not that complicated. Just a shame it's not even close to how it works irl. Irl gtp does not get a power boost out of it. It reduces fuel consumption but keeps power at the same output.
"Doesn't matter, just leave it at Balanced"
"Google searched your question for you

[WHAT LICENSE IS NEEDED TO RACE?  You need a minimum C-level road racing license to participate in the Bathurst 12 Hours and register for this event as a team that includes at least two drivers. iRacing will assign your team a split according to the total road racing iRating of the team. Each split includes 50 cars.  The event features an eight-minute qualifying session to determine the starting grid for each split. The qualifying session allows drivers to record two fast laps. Only one driver from each team can qualify, but the driver who starts the race can be different from the qualifying driver.  The race begins with a rolling start procedure at 5:00 AM sim time. As in the real-life Bathurst 12 Hours, the start and approximately the first 30 minutes of the race is before sunrise.](https://coachdaveacademy.com/tutorials/iracing-guide-bathurst-12-hours-special-event/)"
Did you even try to search via google or the forum? People these days.....
I would expect it to be the same as all the other special events being D4.0 so c class
Except it’s D4.0 and not C level.
All C class series are D4.0
Get a VRS/Simucube/Asetek instead and an adapter for your wheel instead if you like it.
"When you say the power feels less in some corners, are you by chance experiencing FFB clipping? If you look at the upper right of your screen, the bar labeled F will have a green bar but turns red when your motor can't provide any more torque, and gets more numb feeling. This typically happens at high steering, lateral loads, or big spikes. Ideally you should set your iRacing FFB per car by using the auto feature.

If you haven't done this, hop in a track with your car. 

1. Go to options > Use custom controls for this car, save
2. Go to track and press F9, brings up black box in lower right that will let you click an Auto button. Take note of the current FFB strength number.
3. Drive a lap, and while doing so, keep an eye out for the ""Auto"" text to turn yellow.
4. When it turns yellow, click it, and it will adjust your FFB to avoid any clipping.
5. Do this for each car.

If you've done that already, i have nothing to add about the Moza R21."
Simagic
Actually iam  thinking of simucube but the thought of buying wheels is just make it too expensive for me. Maybe with their kit i will give it a search and decide.
"I'm guessing his settings are not correct or he's got a bad wheelbase. I have the R9 and it definitely isn't underpowered in corners or anywhere else. OP, I was having problems with clipping etc... until I started using these settings in the link. It was night and day difference. Maybe try them out before you go spend $1000 on an upgrade that may not be necessary.


https://simracingsetup.com/product-guides/iracing-moza-wheel-settings/"
"I use the auto feature by Iracing, and can explain why it is inconsistent, for example in charlot roval, the turn 9 when tyre dip i feel the force feedback so strong but when takes the sausage curbs on the chicane 11/12 the wheel base provide less force feedback while last chicane it feel way stronger (the sausage curb) and jolty. 
I tried to tune frequency of curb in software but i think the curb are spikes which could be out of the r9 range. 
I am not saying it is bad i actually do with it lower 31 comfortably."
"I went R12 to VRS, amazing and it’s not the newton meters. You can use your wheels with Moza hub adapter ."
Intentionally timing the green and not following the pace speed is against the rules. Easy report.
Almost always a warning for first protest. I protested two guys at Interlagos for starting in the pits and gaining a massive advantage and nothing happened in the results or their activity. Just keep protesting and serial offenders will get theirs.
"There’s a video of Max Verstappen doing this at Sebring and half the comments are defending it with “he timed the start perfectly!” No, it’s against the rules for obvious reasons."
If you protested it they will eventually get a long vacation if they keep doing it.
"I did report, and nothing changed from what I can see. That's what I'm upset about"
"If I remember correctly Max was first in class at least, he just went before all the LMP2’s"
What are you expecting to happen when you file a protest?
"Not in the one I’m thinking of. He passed like 10 in-class cars before sunset and was in the lead pack by T1.

Edit: https://youtu.be/-RadBDA1Nhg?si=HwNkFBb7MSADntBs"
I've seen results updated post race.
Not sure this is the best example. He didn't pass anybody before the race officially started. He definitely didn't get a massive run. Feels closer to grey area than a shining example of gaming the start. 
Yeah it's not instantaneous. Give it a little time for the appeals team to review. 
He didn’t get a massive run? Did we watch the same video?
"Well I got the standard reply back ""This email is to inform you that the protest has been reviewed, and the member under protest has been notified of the outcome"""
"Yes. At the point he is allowed to go, he has only just barely begun to accelerate. 

A massive run would be hanging a second or two back, and accelerating well before the start so that at the start, you are catching and blowing past other cars. He started right behind the other cars, and timed it better (if perhaps half a second early)"
They don’t always change the results. That was a new thing
Could that response have been from a previous report you filed?
"Timing it a half a second early is jumping the start though? And gives you a massive run? I don’t know what the argument is here, he obviously went before the green and left a little gap in front of himself so he could be going faster than the other cars at the start, which is explicitly against the rules."
Nope. It was this instance. Race the session ID matches.
"He was like 1-1.5 car lengths back, and perfectly timed the green flag. The sporting code sayy you cannot approach the starting line ""at speeds that well exceed"" the pacing speed. The example they give is approaching at 150 MPH when pacing speed is 80 MPH. Like maybe it's a *bit* questionable, but it doesn't break sporting code."
"probably just overdriving.

those gt cars are a lot heavier and less downforce. they won't turn as quickly due to the weight and less grip. so you need to be gentler with them compared to downforce cars. plus also trailbraking does help a lot"
"There is a video by a guy named Suelio Almeida who demonstrates with a real world GT driver that understeer on entry overheats the front tires and kills your grip.

Try backing off on the entry and see if it gives you better Apex speed and track out ability"
Start going slower at first and I bet you will be fast. Espcialally at sandown. You really need to slow the car down to get the nose turned jn
I think the slower the car the more important getting a good exit becomes. Fast cars can hide mistakes easier. But I'll let better people confirm that since I don't consider myself that good.
"90% of the time, Understeer = overdriving. 

Stay out of the ABS.

ABS and understeer cook your front tires.

Once you start to cook your tires, it only gets worse."
">I am pretty good at the high downforce cars

GT4's are low downforce. Like, street car, rear wing is for show only, limited downforce.  Definitely not enough downforce to help with grip in low speed corners.

You need to dust off your mechanical grip driving skills. Been awhile since you've driven the Mazda? 😂.  Steer with your brake pedal. Transfer weight with the steering wheel.  Don't over brake on corner entry. Slow in fast out...etc...etc..."
"It's not really about the downforce.  It's because high downforce cars typically have higher power and therefore are more forgiving of small mistakes. They're less momentum based so a crappy corner exit won't impact you as much because you can just power out of it.  

With low power cars you have to manage them constantly to keep the momentum up. And the racing is usually closer so one little mistake and you get swamped. 

Maintaining momentum is a vital fundamental of racing.  If you don't have the fundamentals you'll hit a plateau in high downforce/high power cars even if you have decent pace right now.

So learn the fundamentals in low downforce/low power cars and then it will translate to pretty much any car."
I know the pain.
Some of my fastest gt4 laps i remember thinking mid corner how slow it felt in that moment. They really are super easy to overdrive
Slower into a corner is great in theory but likely to have someone push your rear bumper into the back seat.
You nailed it dude. I was hitting abs a ton and not noticing it / hearing it. I whipped up a little simhub test and was hitting it a lot. Thanks man
Yeahhhh I got out of rookie and went straight into f4 then f3 and lmp3. And to say I was not great at mx5 would probably be a nice way of putting it
Pretty close. But you both transfer weight and steer with the throttle and brake. Steering wheel is just taking advantage of the grip you've provided with the throttle and brake.
"I had the same experience, my fastest laps feel slow when driving them."
I didn't say slower.
"Yeah, I'd suggest revisiting the MX5. I've been running those recently & its helped quite a bit with how I drive the GT4/GT3 cars and not killing the tires on the first couple laps."
"Sorry, I’m trying to learn here also. I’ll watch some Sueilo on YT tonight. I bought the 296 this week and have loads of understeer at Aragon. Especially the left handed before the long straight as well as the corkscrew type section."
Backing off the entry is literally going slower.
"One example of ""backing off on entry"" would be to brake earlier, but softer.  Your average speed and apex speed could still be higher, and in fact that would be the point.

(Yes, you would technically be slower for the segment between the initial and the new braking point, but you could still very well carry more speed into the corner)"
"Holy shit that Kemmel straight 4 wide was insane!! I’m not up with what all the cars are yet, but I’m guessing these may be F4? If so, all I read is how they are seemingly a shitshow when it comes to racing knowledge and etiquette. These 4 cars were dissing that thought, at least until Moncheblanc."

"Yes, a budget DD and even a belt drive wheel like the Fanatec offerings are a big improvement over the gear driven Logitech wheels."
Even the lowest end DD wheel is lightyears ahead of what you're used to.
"When I upgraded from a G29 to a belt-driver TS-PC I was really amazed how much better I could feel what the car was doing. 

Upgrading to a 10Nm DD base was again a big improvement, though for me personally not as huge as the cap between the belt-driven and the clunky gear-driven G29. 

With the current prices there is no reason to go for a belt-driven base anymore btw, DD bases have become so affordable over the last couple of years."
"simply put, any of the budget DD's out there at moment blow the top line belties out of the water.I took the plunge with the CSL DD, and compared to my old TS-PC there is just such a big difference in terms of detail you get to feel. Even with its modest 5nm kit, there was just alot more detail to be had.

I would recommend looking for something in the 8-12nm range however, the 5nm ish ones do offer more detail than any belt but its probably a litle to muted for most.

The CSL DD specifically does have the benefit that you can buy the standard 5nm version first, and later buy the 8nm powerpack.

In short if you consider spending more than say a G29 or T-248, there is no reason to not buy a DD.  


will expensive gear make you better though? Like a streamer once said, no it only hurst more when you crash :-D"
"Yes. The only wheel I had owned before was a DFGT and I got a CSL DD during black friday. It addresses all of the major complaints that I had with the old logitech. Namely the noise, slow rotation, notchy feel (though you will still feel some 'notches' between the magnetic fields but it is way more subtle imo), terrible brake pedal and lack of proper paddles.   


You'll love it."
"DD has really increased my ""feel"" and control through corners."
Just in case you missed a detail of the TLCM pedals. By default the TLCM software sets you somewhere like 70%. Meaning it applies more brake than what you press. I use red red springs and 95% in the software. I want almost 1:1 braking because it takes a ton of force on the brake with red red to lock up a car.
"Went from a g920 to the fanatec dd2. It's a brand new world out there after that switch, and my times have improved dramatically."
"“Affordable” lol. No I get it, much more affordable than in years past. Just not really in the budget right now, hopefully I’ll be back up and running by June (earlier if I can fabri-cobble something together to fix the one I got)"
Oh I am positive that my lack of talent is the biggest thing holding me back ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
"Ok so I’m not crazy, the DFGT is slow to respond right? It feels like most of the time it does ok -ish but especially the bus stop at Daytona, good luck.

And the notchy feel. Holy crap I forgot to mention that. Super speedways  and draft racing are real fun because of this, makes holding a line smooth really challenging."
"Yeah I saw that. Currently I’m using white gray 5 washers. Still racing on a desk with a wobbly office chair. Even the current setup I have is hard to push y leg isn’t conditioned for it and it’s my torn all knee).

Working up to red red, I do like some pedal travel though sp idk."
"Yes ofcourse it's still a lot of money, but when I bought my TS-PC three years ago, DD bases where way out of my price range. Like $1500 for the cheaper ones. Fanatec was the first one I believe to break that price barrier with the CSL DD base. Then other brands quickly followed."
"m8 dont skimp on yourself, one of the main perks of beeing a adult is that you can buy some really nice toys :D"
"Oh yes, it is definitely too slow for some styles of driving. No doubt about it. I got into some very casual drifting since getting the DD and it would have been impossible on the Logitech, but I also remember rallying with higher wheel rotations being unfeasible as well."
Red red still has full travel just takes lots of force. But that's the beauty of customization. A cheap cockpit is GT Omega ART. Love mine and had it for years. $400 total shipped when I got it.
Ouch
"Very very true. I always just end up talking myself out of crap for me though, the money can be used elsewhere. I’m currently drying out some filament to see if I can print some replacement clamps to salvage what I got lol."
"It’s on the list lol. Space is premium right now. But my upgrade list is: 

- a new monitor stand to allow use of 3 (albeit not matching or quality) screens. Currently running on a 32 and have the other 2 on top of it and my FOV is way off since they mount to the back of the desk. But I can’t do a proper FOV since it’s way too zoomed in and even if I set the FOV correct and move the camera back it’s too far zoomed in and the headrest gets in the way

- DD wheel

- better monitors

- rig

I might get it all done by the time I retire."
"I use iRacing to keep my fast food addiction and mild alcoholism in check... How? Well... when I feel like buying some fast food or a 12pack, I go buy a car or a track instead...  Eventually I will run out of cars and tracks but until then this is working (kinda...)


Edit: I just realized OP is probably asking for advice on how to choose cars and tracks... I don't have any advice on that... I pretty much only 'race' the vee at this point and just collect cars and tracks to goof around with..."
"use [https://iracing-week-planner.tmo.lol/](https://iracing-week-planner.tmo.lol/) it can help you for popular tracks every season  


Don't buy cars, focus on very few, buy tracks that you will use many many many times.  


Don't buy cars, I've bought many that I never used. Wait a season for the testing time.  


DON'T BUY CAAAARSS!!!!"
"Generally I’ll pick a series I want to do, pick a car, then buy 3-4 tracks per season for that series, and try to focus on ones I’ve heard of. After a year or so you have a lot of the common tracks."
"There are track buying guides.  I like the iRacing planner website. My most recent batch, I bought nurburgring, spa, daytona, interlagos, and Road America along with a GT4 car.   I am so psyched that it unlocked a bunch more official races for me each week and sometimes I can't even pick which one I want to do because for example, last week, the HPD was at Road Atlanta and the Porsche cup was at Road America and each one is worth a full week of investment!


Figure out what series / cars you want to drive, and then figure out which tracks show up on those series schedules the most."
"Were you able to be promoted to C class just with the free content or have you bought additional stuff? Just got iRacing this week and was recently promoted to D and been wondering what to do next. I'll still run all the tracks in MX5 this season, but have considered buying some tracks next season to run the GR86 at buttkicker or even buying a GT4.

But I feel i have a lot to learn still (havent been able to turn below 54 this week at Oulton Park). Guess the MX5 is a good car to learn the racing craft and that is the goal right now. I'd like to know the opinion of the more experienced ones tho"
"There's 3 main options, although these options are not mutually exclusive, you can mix and match


1. Focus on rookie series and other free content for a while longer. (Or theoretically forever if you really want to be frugal)

2. Pick a series that interests you, and buy the car you need and the tracks. You can focus on that series and race pretty much only it. 

3. Buy a handful of the most popular cars and tracks. With this strategy, you'll be racing something different every week, but you should always have something to race"
"Best? Don't buy anything right away. Watch the different series that interest you for a few weeks. Watch how popular they are on popular tracks and unpopular ones. If it fires even on the unpopular ones, check the schedule to see how many tracks you own versus don't own. Then make sure to buy all the content you need at once to maximize your discount. Get at least six to get 15% off."
I only buy 1 car in series I want to do. Gt4/f4… I’ll pick up a gt3 and super formula when I get there. But that’s it
"Here's a video I made looking at all the C license open wheel options. If that helps at all.

https://youtu.be/kA_7OzoNuzI"
Excellent way to put it haha
THIS. USE THIS WEBSITE.
"You definitely can get to C with free content. The GR86, production car challenge, and thrust master FF1600 series (not the rookie one, there is a D one) are popular on weeks where the track is free.

GR86 this week is at the Charlotte Roval which is free (I think) and has like 14 corners, so that will be good for SR if you can run clean laps."
"Literally just the free context. Spammed MX5 to get out of rookies, dabbles in formula vee, then spammed buttkicker league to get to C. I too was looking at the upcoming races and noticed it was sparse."
"You can get all the way to B with just free content, well this season you could but only on week 1 when mx5 c class was at Okayama."
"Excellent website, but sweet baby jeebus, as a new user that is some grim reading.

No Class D races next week, one the week after and one the week after that. I can see why so many people stay in Rookies forever."
"Tested that. Reminds me of a mini D24. Only ran a few laps, best time I could get was about 10 seconds slower than the lowest split of the race active at the time. Maybe I should stick with Vees."
"It’s a bit much. Once you dig yourself out of rookies you really start to find what kind of cars and disciplines you want to focus in on. For Ovals, once you commit to a series or two you start to purchase tracks accordingly. Similarly, if you get into some leagues you can plan more easily."
"One thing I just recently figured out (or really finally felt brave enough to do it) was that the racing line really slows me down (not necessarily saying you’re using it, but thought I’d throw this in here)

I don’t think for me it is too bad to run a few laps with it to get a general idea of where to brake, but there’s a lot of times it has you lifting or even sometimes braking where you can just go flat out, so I like to run a couple of laps with it then just keep braking a tad bit later or not braking/lifting here or there until I find the limit.  This improved my times by a couple seconds a lap on a lot of tracks! Putting me around 5th-ish on average lap times in the like 1200-1300 irating splits"
"It took a while for me to get used to the GR86, I had been mostly running the FF1600. The track switched to one that had been used for the 1600 the week before so I felt really comfortable on the track, and that's when I figured out how to drive the 86. I still don't think it's the greatest car and only use it on certain tracks, but when it's free it at least counts towards MPR even if you finish dead last. Which you probably won't if you're slower than the pack and not pushing the car too hard on cold tires, wrecking on lap 1

Edit: will throw out that getting 4/4 MPR was the only reason I started racing the GR86 and is the only reason I'm going to race the Proto GT series this season (I bought the HPD because it was 3 dollars, lol)"
I spent too much on cars instead of tracks. I’m paying the price now
"I just went through and laid out the next few weeks, and I can have at least 2 races in Class D road every week by buying three tracks (Mugello, Sonoma and Long Beach). Not really enthused by Long Beach for $15, but there you go. I could add Road Atlanta and have a bunch more, plus I have fond memories of breaking my knee there 20 years ago, so there's that too."
"I broke my nose after the Bristol night race a couple years back, I understand the fondness. Tis, tradition. Don’t forget about the volume discounts when purchasing new stuff either. 

https://www.iracing.com/volume-discounts/"
Might be unrelated but today I haven't been able to connect to the Final Fantasy 14 servers and when trying to use Telegram on my PC it just constantly keeps looking for my conversations. Only way to fix both of these issues is to connect to a VPN and that seems to instantly fix the issue. As a further note I utilize AT&T fiber so it might be an ISP issue.
"VPN fixed my issue, thanks man. i have att fiber too. never had this problem before tho"
I've had this happen in FFXIV before where part of the network route to their servers (somewhere in southern California) was compromised for some people (mostly AT&T fiber users) and the only way to fix it was to find a VPN server that would route you another way to the server. Sounds like what might be happening right now.
So this is a temporary issue ? Using VPN spikes my ping ever so slightly
"It required some provider on that particular node to essentially ""fix their shit"". It seems like every now and then the issue pops up and AT&T users that play FFXIV start complaining about bad lag in-game or outright not being able to log into the servers."
Appreciate the info. Thanks!
"No, not even close. Just newbie race craft.

0x's in GT3 are very common, in iRacing and IRL. 

This looks like he's gone for a late move because you've left the inside open and at first he seems to have a run on you. If you're gonna defend, you've really gotta cover the line. Parking the car somewhere in the middle of the road is still leaving a gap, one he's seen, gone for late and the crash happened. You also had quite a lot of time to see him coming in the mirror and could have avoided the contact and maintained the inside line for the next corner.

IMO just brush this off as competition and sign up for another race!"
A perfect vortex of danger situation
"I spliced together a few clips, he was slightly faster than me so I switched to defense. You can see he bumps me, not a big deal(0x). Going through Casio I made sure to try to get as center as possible. There were a few close calls, where he had to turn off. The hit is the last lap, I am p2 he's in p3, considering the other items and the fact that I don't know how he was going to make that turn without hitting me, makes it feel intentional. Thoughts?"
"If you knew he was there and you still turned into him, then you too compromised both of your races (your own in this case). I would have given him a little more room because I know the chicane is still mine at the next corner. Didn’t put a squeeze in the first turn in, do it in the second when they are slower."
"I guess it was kind of inevitable, I just didn't think he was going to try it again. To defend a short chicane like that one, is it better to be more diagonal? Where I would be essentially blocking off the turn-in and mid-exit or just moving to the outside?"
"just ran out of talent.

especially on the last lap, last chance to try anything... 

whilst blame obviously goes to the guy that stuck his nose in, you should also take this as a learning experience as to how to defend. that was quite a tempting gap after all. 

Stay aware. Either defend properly, or be ready to take the 2 wide line last moment - you would've still had the inside on the 2nd part of that chicane."
"one could just as easily claim  you intentionally steered into a car that had a (admittingly slight) overlap at your turn in point.  


Its just a bit clumsy from both sides really, dont try to make it bigger than it is."
"if you're going to defend, defend early. keep the righthandside covered from the moment you exit 130r. Moving later may mean you perform a protestable block (if the guy behind has already moved to that side), or there's already some overlap and you pit yourself.

If you decide to not defend, keep an eye out as to whether your opponent moves out of your draft or not. if they're not right behind you, it often means they're attacking and you should expect the overlap at any moment.

which way to go is better highly depends on the situation, how big is the gap, how agressive is the other driver, what lap is it? on the final lap people are more likely to attack for instance."
So in this case take the outside line on the chicane?
"I appreciate the insight, as am still getting my bearings with proper defense."
Yes
Report this. They need the pp slap.
He did hold his brakes and stopped. He didn’t look when rejoining. Probably even worse
"Yea that’s a protest and iRacing paddlin. If he’s done this a bunch of times, he might get a vacation. Otherwise, a warning to stop."
"*sigh*

Report

Move on"
When my relative behind is less then 3 seconds i just wait... To bad some just don't seem to care..
"I was in this race! It happened earlier this evening! I'm actually the R8 in the last frame of this clip with the Green and Black livery. 

The rejoin was dreadful, the bit right after this might actually be worse where he just fully rams him. It's bonkers. A bunch of us actually went back and rewatched this clip at the end of the race."
Cause he’s either a selfish jackass or ignorant of the rules. Either way you’ll get up on a protest and he may learn something if he falls into the latter category.
protest this and onto the next one.
That 2nd bump just to assert his dominance
you know why
"Dude! I was the black and red 296 that was right behind you and passed yall both for a P5  finish! He not only didn't hold the brake, but got on the gas and drove straight into you! I hated it for you but was happy to go from 7th to 5th on the last corner."
"This doesn't have to do anything with the question, but damn does iracing sometimes look good like in the video here"
That last hit was stupider than the first. This guy is only looking 2 inches in front of his car. How could he not see you directly in front of him?
"Don't ask me why but this severe lack of situational awareness pisses me off way more than some jackass throwing a fit and sending you into the shadow realm in purpose. At least then there's a chance they have reason to be mad at me, or I have the satisfaction of knowing I got under their skin by being awesome.

These situations I'm just like what the fuck man. How are you so damn stupid?!"
no way ram on a gt3
"Gahhhh… and they had to be racing one of my paints, didn’t they!! 😩😂"
"The same happened to me two hours ago. I know it hurts.

You have to protest and move on. Its racing."
"Awful luck. But in his defense, he was stopped on the apex of a corner, so maybe he thought it was a good idea to drive off the racing line. A bad decision, but somewhat understandable."
"I’ll say it again, rejoins like that should result in a temp ban. This behavior is all too common."
He was going to ram Ram.
Because he is F1GamerDan
sucks he pulled out but also at the same time you didnt leave much room and cut it pretty close.  you very clearly turned left before you even passed him when there was tons of space to go around
"Y’all just need to start name dropping so they can be publicly shamed.

![gif](giphy|vX9WcCiWwUF7G|downsized)"
I can’t wait until iracing adds a feature where you can punch someone through your monitor.
Gotta get back on track.. gotta go.. GOTTA GET ON TRACK.. GOTTA GO AHHHHH FUCK HURRY IMMA LOSE POSITIONS GO GO GO GO GO.. oh.
Could be a single screen things with bad visibility and zero track awareness.
Because then he only ruins his own race!
Mi thinks they listened to that inner voice
Because he wants you to protest him
He tried to rejoin and didnt use his brain. Plain and simple.
And then he runs into you. What a fucking fuck.
Proceeds to hit you again
"Life lesson. Always try to aim for the rear of parked cars as most people will move forward from a spin. Not always possible, but it has saved me many times from people who don't hold the brake till traffic passes."
"You think there is nothing worse than spinning out and having to wait (sometimes a lot) for cars to safely pass through but damn it's better than being guilty of ruining someones race (+your own) and looking like a complete fool.   


Tough luck dude!"
![gif](giphy|slEFKfuFOa5C8|downsized)
"Why didn´t he just go backwards and resafes joinly? Its so easy ....  
Feel sorry for you man. Not the way one want to end his race."
[removed]
And then he hit you again to boot. What a dummy.
"He held them, stopped, and start to drive again.

Report this twat."
Off topic OP but what graphic settings are you using?
wat is nam of game
"> reincorporation

Can we please start using this instead of rejoin"
How he hit you again when looking straight at you killed me 💀
Holding his brakes wasnt the problem here. He gets back onto throttle. And then drives into you again as a battering ram like a lot of people do when a car is in front of them.
Single screen syndrome…
"So the car that spun was in a hurry to finish. Great! Reverse the car into the grass, point the nose fairly parallel to the racing surface, and drive.

Too many people try to do those snap-rejoins and end up ruining others' races. It's just dumb."
"This is one of the first times I've seen a post that I think warrants a report, if not for the first contact, definitely for the second one."
Because he's 12 years old.
Twist his pp!
I'd love to see some data around the relative/blackbox usage. I am certain that I would be shocked not shocked to see how unused it is.   
For me it´s from 6 seconds onwards. Below is too dangerous for my personal feeling AND my experience XD
"I’ve mapped two buttons to glance left and right so I can see the cars comming and rejoin safely

Edit : why the downvotes ? I don’t crash when rejoining

But looking gives you more info than just the relatives 

For example if you crashed at the end of a straight, you can see if a battle is comming and if you should wait a bit more

Or if the guy comming looks like he is keeping it on the racing line so you can rejoin off line

Better to have the timings and sight, than just trust a number on the bottom of your screen

Especially when there is a huge speed delta"
"So you definitely heard me hating this guy 😅 I had a lot of luck with 3 or 4 cars that spun right in front of me in that race, I guess I just ran out of luck..."
"Not so much dominance, more like asserting his minimal brain capacity..."
Oh man I was trying so hard to keep our gap and finish above you! You were like 0.5 faster than me and I was so happy finishing above you but suddenly this happened ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)
"He expected him to do the same and jet out into the live track and clear way instead of sitting and waiting

Sitting amd waiting is an alien philosophy to this guy"
…so reverse gears don’t exist anymore? This was inexcusable….either reverse off track or don’t move an inch.
"> lot of luck with 3 or 4 cars that spun right in front of me in that race, I guess I just ran out of luck...

Everyone panics in the moment sometimes. I think iRacing has the balance right."
Close. Haha. He’s using one of my paints 😂
Rewatching the clip I see I turned very early as you said. Honestly at the moment I thought I had already passed him but also that he was going to reverse. Maybe if I went a bit more to the right this never happened. But I just wanted to pass him and finish the race because it was the last corner.
I was actually looking and he came to almost a complete stop.  With a slight delay in inputs I don’t think it was malicious as I can see how it may have seemed as if black slowed down/stopped enough to let him rejoin.
"On a single screen, he should still be able to fit in the tiny relative black box that tells him that the heroic rejoin he's planning is a bad idea."
"Did that, got a penalty and had the thing where I had to slow down because I cut the corner. Lost positions."

I think you discovered English is not my mother tongue🤣 I REALLY forgot the word rejoin
Give him the old pp twist!
I don't use mine. I have overlays for that stuff.
You cant see all upcoming cars that way
"Oh yeah we did, TBH it was pretty deserved, the average SoF here wasn't low and I'd expect better than an incident like this. 

I'll be putting in a report over the weekend anyway for him over this as I've still got the replay file and was intending to do so before. 

Happy racing for the future my man!"
Dude I know! I was driving my ass off trying to catch you. I was like please 1 more lap! 😆 I went off track in Qual on both laps so had to start in the back and drove as hard as I could to make it up there behind you. It was good racing though and I truly hated to see you get taken out like that.
all good. just something to learn from.  giving a little more room.
The ole dick twist!!!! Twist his dickkkk!!!
So you do use it
Damn -12 when you're just saying you use an overlaid black box.
Yes and I have the relative too
![gif](giphy|90y5C4JFnzZdeOHy2d)
Oh my gawd dude this is an mma fight!
Sir this is a Wendy’s
"Ahh I assumed he was talking about iRacing's Blackbox relative in which I don't use since I utilize iOverlay for the relative information.

My mistake."
Yes but the data wouldn't show that he uses it if he uses an overlay
We are a fair kind of ppl lolz
He was. He mentioned the data around using it. People downvoting you are completely missing the point.
Had to upvote before the downvote mafia gets you too 🤣
Ahh probably the same people that pull back onto track infront of people.
"PCup is good for learning how to properly drive a race car. 

It's very punishing, but the skills you learn will translate to other sports cars. 

But if you don't want to deal with that, then you can just get in the GT3 R"
"If you just want to worry about racing against others, go for the GT3s. 

If you want to battle against your own car, trying to tame it, and still have to deal with everything else, go for the Porsche Cup. 

I absolutely love the car! GT3s are fun but seem too easy compared to PCup. 

The only thing I don't like is the minimum license requirement. People with C license are usually a bit careless on wrecking both you and them. 

Give us your feedback after your choice. 
Good luck and have fun!"
Can you handle no ABS or TC? The car is very twitchy and there is a reason many people who do run P Cup run nearly exclusively P Cup (for tin tops).
"The Porsche Cup is a fantastic choice for mastering race car control. The GT3 field is a fantastic choice for close and competitive racing.

You can absolutely run both if you are comfortable with switching back and forth!"
"P Cup is extremely difficult, even more than other non TC non ABS cars in the game.

GT3 cars all drive super nice and relatively easy to handle."
"PCup is really really fun. Participation is great, racing is great, the car is quick and hard to drive, but it is hard not just for you but for everyone on the track."
"Gt3 is very boring but leads to multiclass with IMSA which is the best form of road racing imo.

If you don't wanna do multiclass, Pcup is a much more interactive car and very fun when you're not killing yourself. Pcup at Interlagos is one of my all time favorite combos"
"I went from FF1600 to Porsche cup (after a brief stint in F4). I'm having a blast, it's been a steep learning curve but it's good fun."
"I recently got the pcup car after having driven gt4s,gt3 and the lmp2&hpd and like others have said, there is a massive learning curve to it. I swear the tires feel like they were removed from an old timey wagoncart. Naturally I've been really struggling running consistent laps. I'm going to keep practising, hoping it clicks eventually, but I am really mystified by why the tires feeling so terrible on the car.

 So if you get it be prepared to feel extremely frustrated, it makes me want to buy the BMW gt3 so I can get away without any practice lol"
What class is porche cup?
"From what I understand, but have no personal knowledge of, is that if you want the experience of a Porsche Cup car and don't want to spend the money to find out you hate it, buy an Aussie Supercar for a couple of bucks. Because that will try and kill you in a very similar fashion."
"If you're curious of the Porsche Cup, I've got a discord that's one of the largest (700+) and we host two different Porsche Cup leagues which would give ample practice to improve. If you're curious for more come check us out. We're also looking into adding more racing series next season.

https://discord.gg/WJe48DBje5"
Eh you’ll get used to it
"The GT3 R also likes to spin until you know how to handle it properly, so it's not like you won't learn *anything*.

For that, pick the BMW instead :D

jk"
Well actually I would like to try that car and I think it will be very rewarding once you get handle of it. However I'm not sure about my abilities. I don't think I'm good enough driver to handle that beast 😅
"Well that's what I don't know, since GT4's have it. Hard to say actually"
C-class
"Cool, can I sing up mid season or should I wait to next one?"
"The 992 is more stable then the 991 was. That car ACTIVELY tried to kill you. 

It was great."
"It's a learning curve but don't give up, it's very rewarding. I learned to love the car. 

 I also love to watch this guy drive it IRL : https://youtu.be/qKI-auJl2C8?si=pM26kLidC3pJyp0V

it made me realize the real car seems to handles the same which is crazy"
"I think the difference between GT3 and PCup is that GT3 is that making a small mistake in GT3 will just make you slow and maybe overheat your tires.  A small mistake in PCup can easily end your race and/or others.

Just depends on what you enjoy."
"Really it comes down to what you want from your iRacing career. Committing to the Cup car *will* make you a better driver over time because it requires delicate, smooth inputs to avoid locking on entry and spinning on exit. That translates to every other car on the service and leads to generally more consistency.

That being said, the Porsche Cup is more ""work."" It'll take time to lap safely and consistently, especially if you're used to leaning on ABS/TC, and a bit more time to be really competitive. That being said, if you've been running GT4 for a while and feel really comfortable with it, GT3 should be a relatively easy transition. Your pace will be lacking at first and GT3 is a VERY competitive field, but I'd expect you to be feeling comfortable and getting up to pace relatively quickly in it.

So in my opinion it's a question of whether you want to put in some time to really develop your driving, or if you're already feeling good and just want to jump into a new car you can enjoy quickly with big grids."
We accept mid season signups :)
"I loved it, it was glorious"
"I've seen you follow Iracing schedule, is that every season?"
"Every season yup, prefer to follow schedule. If we make our own, then someone can practice all week for this 1 big race, make a mistake, and the week's practice went to waste. In this scenario, you can put it to good use in the public official races :)"
"Oh maaan, I'm in, will get into that Porsche next week and I'm in. This league sits my schedule so well and the fact that you have multiple race formats and follow Iracing schedule is selling it for me. Thank you for the offer 😀"
"There’s extreme tire deg this week due to the track temps and setup. The average Indy fixed driver sadly doesn’t practice enough to realize this, overdrives the shit out of it and is simply unable to control their car after as few as five laps."
"I'm 1.5k and Atlanta was my second race on Indy. 3 yellows, and P4 on finish... It was good race with many side by side action in front of me.

I don't know, for this moment, it's Indy and 380km/h but looks like average race that I experienced in NASCAR."
It’s because the track temp is 133 degrees Fahrenheit. Ppl are spinning out on starts and restarts because you can’t just go full throttle in 1st gear like they normally can and most are finding that out the hard way this week lol
"Welcome to Indy fixed at a superspeedway, muffins and incident report forms are always stocked on the table in the back 

(Don’t race Indy fixed expecting good racing, your average driver in this series thinks they own the track, even in 3k+ sofs)"
You need to change the ARB to get it to track set the front to 1 rear to like 6 and the car starts handling
"I started indy a few weeks ago and this is the first track i notice tire deg having a big effect at all.

No wonder so many are not used to it"
You can thank the insane track temps for that. It’s like driving on ice.
Its not a superspeedway.
this worked amazingly well. Way more consistent grip. Can you explain why this works? It seems like that drastic adjustment would cause alot of oversteer but it wasnt bad.
The new version of Atlanta is a superspeedway
Raising the ARB makes it stiffer and lowering it makes it softer. By stiffening the rear it allows the wing to stay up in the air more giving you much better grip then you adjust with the weight jacker as the race goes on to compensate for tire qear
"They only changed the banking, not the lenght"
"Yep and that turned it into a flat out pack racing superspeedway, glad you’ve come to the realization"
It's not flat in the Indycar.
"You don't actually need to lift off during upshift - just hold the throttle on, quickly put the clutch in and shift up and then release the clutch."
"Map a clutch button, or very short clutch pedal travel to give you the slightest of blips. Upshifts only"
"You don't need to lift while shifting the ff1600, nor blip on downshift. Make sure you have auto blip and auto clutch turned on in settings."
"This car requires such a small lift for the upshift that I don’t even bother with the clutch. I ran some laps trying both and it didn’t seem to matter for straight line speed. It’s a lot more fun that way, too!"
"Auto blip and auto clutch will cost you lap time, leave them off. Going up the gears you just flat shift - keep the throttle buried and punch the clutch as you shift. On the downshift you don't even need to blip the throttle, as long as you don't try and shift from 4th straight back to 1st its almost impossible to compression-lock the rear end."
"Nah, lifting definitely costs time compared to clutch in and flat shift it"
What series and times you after might help
NiteHawk weekly racing series runs everything from trucks to dirt to road to much to put and schedule is always different for the time attacks
Hopefully they give orange a few weeks off for that one.
"No, that super unfortunate. The guy panic avoided - he had room to the right as well and that should have been his first thought process when the guy in front had a bad launch. Instead he chose to over avoid into the pack."
Doesn't give dude a reason to intentionally wreck someone
Now this is rallycross.
I feel your pain. I’ve been wrecked in oval races in the first turn on lap one 5 times in a row….one of them I had 8x points before green because I got rammed from behind and a guy warming his tires hit me from the side. Super frustrating.
Looks like he didn’t realize his wheel wasn’t centered. I’ve done that on a start before in formula vee where you can even see the wheels.
Is getting a good SR in dirt racing hard? There would be a lot of collisions. Or does the system allow for a little bit of contact?
[removed]
"i so feel you man:

[https://youtu.be/\_nMGbv-OYno](https://youtu.be/_nMGbv-OYno)"
The guys that think they can win a race before turn 1 are the problem. Y’all need to chill out.
Exactly😔 happened a few times now in rally. Very frustrating. No apology makes it more infuriating
"No it doesn’t, but I’d be lying if I didn’t think about doing it myself hahaha. He just let the intrusive thoughts win 😈"
"Keep ur head high, with time may come more iRating and better splits 😄 but yeah still not what you want. Idk I feel like iRacing has to implement a better strategy for new racers to understand formation laps and all that. Too many incidents happen before green flag it’s ridiculous."
I think he more over reacted to the car in front not launching on green. Stupid and unfortunate
"They are definitely a lot more lenient when it comes to dirt racing, but yeah it’s a lot harder to avoid a crash/incident when you’re in dirt. Just need to be prepared for a couple dumpster fire starts like this 😁"
"Light contacts are 0x, so if you can control your car, there’s almost no difference with road in terms of gaining SR."
"Extremely lenient on collisions, 90% of contracts are 0x and I believe the worst you'll get is a 2x. Decent amount of corners too.

By far the biggest problem is that the races are SHORT AS HELL. Rookie races are at most 7 minutes long and if you hate the pro trucks like me then they only race once an hour."
Ok bud. I’ll be waiting at the finish line for ya 👋🏁
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"I think I have a moment every day where I would love to Forza bomb someone in my race. Still haven't done it which is good on my part, but I definitely do think about it 😂"
I suppose I forgot to mention I didn’t get any incident points for the accident either. Even being wedged in the wall. So take that for what you will lol
🥰
I checked out last 10 rx races and in every race I gained sr. So it’s fairly easy if you’re not trying to do anything stupid.
"Just porsche things. 

Bigger lift earlier, flat out through the whole turning phase. No touchy the curbs. Lift while turning and you die."
"Go into practice and set an active reset and test it like 100 times. At least in the BMW, if I lift to like 25% and turn in right between the curve in the wall on the right and the 1 board, I'll just clip the curb, then full throttle right before the end of the apex curb, I'll track out right to the edge of the outside curb. Super tricky and inconsistent for me though, but that seemed to be the fastest.

In terms of avoiding spinning, one thing I found in testing was that you either want to be not touching the curb at all (ideal) or have your inside wheels on the curb and outside off to the right of the curb. If you hit your outside wheels or don't fully commit to riding the curb, instant death (I found this out mid-race too...). A lot of times if you go over the curb AFTER the curb has fully started you won't get a 1x, but honestly if you know you might hit the curb, just commit to riding it like I said and take the potential 1x; that's much preferred over spinning and totaling your car like I did. Hope that helps and applies to the Porsche too!"
"Are you clipping the grass with your two right wheels on the outside entry? Try this and as you go for the apex try lifting 60-70% and do not add too much steering angle aiming only the two outside wheels on the exit curb... As you build confidence you'll be able to lift less depending on your approach. Also, take a look at YT lap guides, there are lots of them. 
Good luck"
If you go over the outside curb just ride it out don’t try and get back on the track.
I’ve never thought of 130R as a particularly difficult corner…until I race again and realize the massive difference between drivers’ entry speed. Super easy to get brake checked on entry and bump the driver next driver up (sorry to the guy on front of me last race)
"The Porsche just doesn’t like it, I find always keeping the throttle a minimum 25% bit in and very smooth steering keeps it from killing me, do not lift fully off in the middle of the turn the car goes extremely light, do all your lifting off before you turn in. The exit kerb I feel your pain I had a weird experience on a quali lap where I got literally stuck on the kerb and my steering inputs did nothing, the car essentially grinded along it then launched off onto the wall lol.

3 hours on the weekend will be fun"
Porsche GT3R likes smooth inputs in high speed turns. And doesn't like it when you lift in the middle of the corner.
This was such a game changer in the race I just did. Also surprised just how much you can cut the inside curb. Feel like that would be infinitely more dangerous at those speeds IRL but what do I know? lol
Glad it worked out for you. Onward and upward

"Greetings!

OMEC is taking a week off from our regular format to run a Special Event: 2hrs @ IMOLA.

We're opening this up to other communities and would love it if you joined us.

This is a team event with a required driver swap.

Really? A driver swap for a 2 hour race? Yep! It's a different ballgame when your finish is tied to the performance of a teammate. For those who didn't get a chance to stress out for 24hrs at Daytona recently, this could be a fun way to dip your toes in.

&#x200B;

Event details are in the image, but if you have any other questions, ask on the discord or just DM me.

"I saw it and thought the same thing. Would also love to see the Mustang GT3/4, Lambo Evo 2, Corvette GT3, etc. Sadly no way to know if/when we'll get any of them afaik."
"From what I remember earlier today, I saw a post with the paddock schedule of the Daytona events and it had “iRacing scanning” or something like that with a blocked out time on it. No telling what the scans were tho"
"Part of the problem is that iRacing have had a lot of cross-functional projects that require art resources.  The last of those (that they’ve announced, at least) is rain, and that’s getting to the end stages.  So hopefully they can pick the content pace back up, but remember that this is essentially a pipeline bubble - once resources pivot back to cars and tracks, it’ll still be a bit before we see an impact."
Yeah there are so many new cars for them to add it’s crazy. The good thing is that iracing has a contract with imsa for their racing series so maybe they would add their cars sooner rather than later
"Ford and (supposedly) Corvette. 

The posted schedule was from Ford Multimatic but others in the paddock said they scanned the corvette too. "
That’s interesting. Maybe they’re scanning multiple cars then
"They also have to licence the car from the manufacturer which isn't free. 

Then they have to build it, also not free. 

It's a couple hundred thousand dollars per car. "
Nice improvement man! Bet that first win was mega nerve wracking?
Yea man it was nuts couldnt get my leg to stop shaking while i was braking 😂 today was my third win and i finally was able to stay calm while leading for the most part.
"It's crazy the adrenaline rush/mental shit that goes on when you suddenly find yourself in the lead. 

When I first started iracing I'd already done some other sim racing, so the initial splits I was in were a bit below my level/I wasn't bricking it when leading, but that first time leading a race in top split, I was a wreck.

 Started p3, p1 and 2 took each other out on lap 1, and I was totally unprepared for the stress 😂. Had a 10 second advantage from incidents behind, that I barely held onto by the end, won by about 0.3 seconds 😂."
"It's such a nice feeling to get to that point where you can be leading and not super stressed haha, a definite sign that you're getting confident in your abilities!"
Oh wow thats a crazy way to win sounds exciting though😂 so far all 3 of mine have been from starting 1st im hoping to win from behind soon though thats the more fun way lol
Yea man for sure still got a bit of nerves which will never change but its getting easier with every lap lead👍
"Idk man winning from pole is something else, that's pure domination!

 I'm still holding out hope of one day getting the ""perfect race"". Qualify on pole, lead every lap, fastest lap of the race and 0x incident points."
"Thats what my first win was! Perfect race it was crazy got pole, lead every lap, had fastest lap and 0 incidents! Was crazy when i realized my first win was a perfect race 😂 Sadly my others although won from pole i got a couple off tracks haha"
"Oh wow, what a way to to win! Must be so cool to feel the improvement on track and in the results!"
"Do you log in using Steam account? In iRacing UI you can write mail and password, but like but bottom you can see Steam icon. Do you trying to login into iRacing by pressing in this Stream icon?"
"I had this about 2 weeks ago. When I went to log in to iRacing UI, there was an option to activate steam account. I clicked it and it came up with an error my account is already active, then tried logging in again and it worked

I think the renewal didn't go through properly even though I'd paid and clicking that button forced it to check the status of my steam subscription"
"Best advice is to Email Iracing and have them convert your account to be separated from Steam. When I first started, I had nothing but problems using steam. They usually fix it same/next day. Everything will just run through the iRacing portal instead of steam."
"Maybe better to hide numbers and enjoy racing. Because iRacing it's not rating numbers, it's every single moment on racing against other and with love to them and your car."
"Rudy

"Go race something else for a little bit, like dirt oval or dirt road."
"My advice, go dip a toe in another licence. I hear dirt is fun when you’re in a slump. Then start again with some fresh perspective."
"Go race the pro 2 lites for a bit, who knows, you might start liking it."
"A lot of it comes from predicting behavior based on what you can see in the virtual rearview mirror. Triples don't help here because they usually have to be 50% alongside before you'll even see them out a side window, and by then if you turn in on them you're screwed anyways. 

If you're using the external Crew Chief there are some settings you can adjust on how quickly he'll trigger on an overlap with another car."
Sim lab has some fairly good radar indicators you can use as overlays for free.
"stock the iracing spotter wont kick in right away which can lead to some chaos on pace laps before green and t1 or 2.  there is a line in one of the ini files that you can turn on to make the spotter call out cars right from the jump.  if youre having problems that early in the race, changing that might help you out. i forget exactly which file and line but its most probably in the spotter section.

if i remember to look when i get on the sim pc ill edit it in here.

check out some of the third party add ons cause some of them have a something that resembles a radar.  simhub has a car left/right thing too if thats all you need."
Racelabs helped me quite a lot with some of its features. I don’t use the blind spot overlay but I do use the radar overlay and I find that pretty helpful. It’s free
"Racelabs radar overlay, or iOverlay has proximity bars. I've used both and both are good."
How can there be lapped cars ahead of you on lap 1?
Blind spot overlay from race labs is great to see when people are along side. Works just like modern road cars to tell you not to move over.
"Thanks for all the pointers, CrewChief and the Racelab overlays seem to be helping! That is until I get spun by net code!"
"Thanks, I think I need to get crewchief, it does seem to kick in sooner. Sometimes the iracing spotter won't kick in for long time and misses things because it's still telling me lap times!"
"hey u/Due-Rush9305 i finally remembered to check what line to edit in the ini files.  its in the app dot ini file in the \[SPCC\] section.  edit the line that says 'carLowHiAtStart=0' and change the 0 to a 1 then save.  it should look like carLowHiAtStart=1 when youre done

this way once the green flag drops the spotter will start calling out left/right"
Out of the last few races most have been some incident on lap 1. I finally had a race where I thought I had dodged the carnage and was going well. Caught some lapped cars and they spun in front of me. That was what prompted the post
"You can edit the iracing spotter parameters in the app.ini file. 

Crew chief isn't better than the iracing spotter, just different. 

As others have said, you need to work on situational awareness and predicting your surroundings. It'll come with time and with reviewing the replays of your incidents from inside your cockpit, follow cam, and the views from other cars. Be analytical and objective, and I promise you will learn something from almost every incident. 

Also, keep at it. You'll be fine."
Sounds to me like the shaft has started to come lose. Is there a noticeable gap between the shaft and the collar? Might be worth reseating the shaft and seeing if that helps
Damping maybe?
"Could be min force.

You can temporarily rename the documents/iRacing folder to iRacing_backup when the sim is not running and that will reset everything to the defaults. And in the wheel tuning menu just select an unused profile. That will get you back to the baseline."
"Thanks! I think this might be the one, I’ve played around with it, it’s not totally gone but feels much better!"
You could also just match the the fanatec recommended setting for iRacing and see if that helps.
What's your safety rating? 
Avg incidents is a little high
Halfway to 10! Keep it up! Keep on winning!
2.8 class D
Not really tbh. I have 6.8 avg myself in A3.8.
"If he’s running MX-5 races, this is super high."
Oh really? I thought my 4.5 avg was on the high side lmao
Yeah true. Didnt think too much before commenting lol. I drive usally drive IMSA or VRS.
"Yep. Anything less than 30 minutes is a no-go for me. I had 11x doing 325 laps at Daytona in the 24, hopefully this guy graduates to the distance races where keeping it clean is expected to be the standard."
I've owned the sim for 3 weeks. Raced maybe 7 days.
on trading paints you can go to the paints you are racing and remove it from the car. you can then also upload your new one
Easy when you know right? Sorted it no problem thank you!
Nobody gives a shit because the guy behind you doesn't give a shit and will steal your place because you tried to not wreck while they gambled whether they'd make it through alive. It's a real shame and I wish something could be done.
"I mean, ignoring yellows is one thing, but those were some diabolical rejoins…"
"Enforced local yellows in road would be the single most beneficial change to the quality of racing. 

Yellows are already enforced in oval, and you have to give back positions gained, and they already account for crashed cars, yet it's not implemented in road.

My proposal: under yellow flag, any car with a loss of control or 4x contact should be fair game, but if you overtake anyone else, you'd have to give back the position in the next 30 seconds or get a drive through penalty."
Typical day on I-70 in the midwest.
"I was in that race. And both the GT1s and the GT2s had a decent gap to go through, hadn't it been for one (or more) of the higher class cars close that gap in the last second. 

Both of the following classes also slowed down quite a bit, before they reached the accident. But you are not going to basically stop, when you have a clean path through and everyone involved is already stationary."
I wondered about this as a new player doing GT4 at mount panorama. People just ignore caution on the mountain to their own detriment.
![gif](giphy|Ojav55aWwFqdiWYi7q)
"Yeah, the thing is that I used to slow down but that led to dangerous situations with everyone behind me going past me left and right.
I think now everyone just keeps pace to not lose places."
OP did you protest the illegal rejoins? 
The problem is that there's really no good way to do it. You see issues with passing under yellow penalties on oval restarts all the time when someone crashes. It's just hard to do reliably without catching a ton of false positives.
So much lol in this video.
The driving standards in this game.. really something to behold.
"It doesn't say in the sporting code that drivers need to slow down for a yellow, just that they need to be aware and proceed with caution. 

If you feel like this is not the case, then protest."
"There was zero issue with the yellow flag here. Those rejoins were stupid and are reportable. 

If the GTs would have gone max 80 kph and we have gtp just rejoining like idiots, it would have still been chaos."
"People don't follow it for the same reason they often don't IRL. Drivers fight tooth and nail for every tenth of a second they can get, they aren't going to just throw it all away and lose 5 seconds because of a yellow flag, in which if they just ignore it and just stare a little harder into the distance they'll probably be fine."
"Nah. Yellows end up enforcing themselves in the long run. 

Those who shoot the gap eventually have their luck run out while those who slow typically survive"
"In your example, how well do you expect a line of code/lines of code to properly punish and properly not punish people? Like it's a fucking mess, I don't have any faith that if I was in this pack that it would properly punish me or properly not punish me for doing what is ""correct"" or ""incorrect"". Just look at GT7 and their real-time penalties; it's a fucking shit show. What we have now which is just a notification of caution ahead works. Sure some people get lucky and hail mary through the carnage but a lot of times they fuck up and get fucked up."
Hey I was in that race in GT1! I think it started because some HPD drivers tried to go three wide in Curva Grande. I really thought  I could stop before the wreckage but I got yeeted into oblivion by the guy behind!
Maybe - for those that are behind the crash - make a car transparent if they slow down to yellow flag pace. And for cars that are ahead of the crash - enforce a drive through if you don’t slow down within 3-4 seconds of a yellow.
Maybe some type of auto speed limiter makes sense
"Or guy behind you will just rear-end you and ruin your race, if had this happen so many times.

It's like, slow car ahead, car behind me continuing to gain, as I watch wrecked car try to gain control while I figure out where to pass, I slow more and BAM rear-ended by some dude who after I watch the replay, doesn't even touch his brakes until he's 40ft away from me.

Give me a break. 😅"
"I mean I think that’s OP’s point. 

“Enforcing yellows” would mean penalizing drivers who pass under a yellow flag. Which in most racing is generally exactly what happens."
"isn't passing under yellow a penalty in real racing? Seems like real racing has the exact same situation, if somebody could pass you from behind then you're not going to slow down either"
this. the track was basically clear and then 2 drivers both decided they didn’t want to let the any of the gt3 field through
it should be any x or slower then 50mph imo. That would catch all situations.
"Another change would be a random chance of a full course yellow for series that utilize a pitstop. Been trying it in a league and it drastically changes the feel of a race and implements some strategies without feeling overbearing of constant pacing due to incidents.

If.you have an off before the yellow, you have opportunity to make up those positions, but also groups everybody back up for more intense racing.

Doesnt have to be 100% chance over the course of a race, do 50% chance of a FCY and 5% chance there would be a second."
I wish they just disabled power to everyone on track when crash occures in a certain sector and makes you go 15kmh or whatever speed they deem clever.
There’s is some super reckless rejoins combined with full throttle yellows here.  Sad.
"I don't ever race down the mountain anymore just because of this, it's a wreck fest and when you let up to avoid crashes and respect what would be a yellow flag, people will slam right into you"
And the standards here are FAR better than other sims. It's the unfortunate reality of racing games and sims as a whole.
"This happens way too much to me, slow down to avoid a collision, guy just drives into the ass end  of my car at full speed"
Because then only one class’s race gets ruined 😡
"Slower than whatever or an offtrack without any contact only means that driver is carefully dodging the crash, and therefore should not be punished."
"I found the iRacing standards to be rather embarrassing generally back when I raced in it. Even public AMS2 servers are cleaner. rFactor 2 is generally flawless with the odd exception here and there. I've never encountered incompetent, vindictive or mean spirited racers in either of those. iRacing is a very different story. I guess the vast sums of money people have to pour into it is making the whole thing a bit nuts."
"If you’ve gone off track to avoid then you can be overtaken in real life. You can’t expect the whole field to stop and wait for you to rejoin. I get you that it’s unfair, but if I come round a corner in yellows and you’re off track, how do I know you’re not a part of the accident?"
"It honestly depends on the track and series for iRacing. Monza and Spa with GT3's and the lower Formula cars are usually shit shows. But most tracks it's usually fine, a few idiots but it goes well beyond that."
Bro if you are 400 ir I can coach you for free. Really just run laps together then give you pointers. I’m not a pro but have 9x your irating so positive I could get you on the path to 1500 at least pretty easily.
"Coaching will help but the number 1 thing is you need to practice. Watch some track guides to see where to brake. Don’t use the line. It’ll only take your focus off the road and braking points. Learn without it. 

It will take hours and hours of practice to learn how to handle a road course but it will come to you."
"Yep, this is problem. But maybe try to do slower. Go to test drive, pick up Mazda and just make some laps on speed 70-80km/h even on straight, just like you will be driving in real world road? Then when you will comfortable staying on road, increase speed on 10-15km/h, and repeat this again and again until you will start a race on track, not just driving.

Then, with time, you will figure out how your car can slowdown and turn, corners starts look familiar and similar on different tracks. Like some corners on Silverstone looks same as corners on COTA.

Or, maybe I crazy, but I can help you via Discord like helped some friends who was with same problem. It's for free.

You also can join to race that's goes, like for watching, but you can race, nobody will see you, but your mistakes will not ruin you or someone race. But with this you will learn how other people drive."
You need to take the time to practice. If you don’t know your reference points in a race you’re going to have a bad time.
Get Trophi AI. it's free. It will teach you how to road race.
"Sounds like you need to load the track out some music on and go for a ‘Sunday drive’ not going race speed but just going round safety, get the flow of the track and the feel of the car rolling in corner/ diving under breaks. 

Also if your crashing a lot on the first lap, it can take a lap/2 max to warm your tyres up, it can sometimes feel like ice on the first lap, increase your breaking distance even more until the cars warmed up and feeling a bit more alive and grippy"
"Sounds like you haven’t done any research, watched videos, pro laps, compared telemetry, used garage61, trophi.ai or anything to try and get better"
"Go into a solo practice with any track and any car. take a few deliberately slow laps just to get some heat into the tires. Then try to racing speed out of the turn ahead of your least favorite part of the track and set a dynamic reset point. Then go at the turn as best you can. Crash. Reset. Try braking later and harder. Crash. Reset. Brake earlier. Crash. Reset. Downshift sooner to engine brake. Blowup/crash. Reset. Brake hard and early then trail brake. Crash reset.   


Basically guess you're way to it until you stop crashing and can hit it with decent speed.  


Then back off ever so slightly so that you can make it through the corner consistently.   


Then on to the next corner and the next until you can get a lap.  


This part is actual work and kind of frustrating but you'll learn a ton about what the car can and cant do. So when you get to the next track, you'll be way ahead of where you are currently. 

&#x200B;

Also, its good to note that the Vee and FF1600 need a little gas to get through the corners right.  For example, on turns 4&5 at Charlotte you dont touch the brake, it's only a lift (and downshift in the FF1600). The first time you do that it will feel like you're going to go flying off the track but its so much more stable than using the brake."
"I hate the MX-5, so I drive the Formula Vee. It's fun and hard to control but better than the MX-5."
It’s the right turns huh
Have you done any telemetry comparisons on VRS or Garage61? If not I’d start there before paying for coaching.
"Don’t use the driving line for anything other than validating your “gut feeling”. With good practice you should start to get a feel for the driving line within a few laps whenever you get on a new track. Focus on finding that line first without trying to go fast. Just try to get that natural feeling first. 

Once you’re comfortable in going around the track on medium pace (not super slow but you’re fully aware you’re leaving heaps of time on the table), then try to step the pace by braking more aggressively and exiting the corners more aggressively. 

Always remember that braking super late or going into a corner too hot is going to work against you - because it may ruin your exit of the corner, which means you’re bleeding time all the way until the next corner.  Also if you feel you’re about to yeet yourself off the track in every corner - take it down a notch."
"I have been racing for 2 days. No prior experience. I earned my D license, and started with a 1084 rating.

For those 2 days (my days off work) I did nothing but race the same course in the same car for two 10 hour stints. It’s do-able! You got this!"
"If you can't find braking points, then you simply are not putting in enough practice. You have to keep at it until you find some place you can consistently brake and make the corner.

To begin with, try lifting slightly before braking, just keep it smooth, don't care too much about hard braking at the last possible moment.  


You cannot expect to jump into races blindly. You need to practice every single track you plan to race on."
You don't need a coach. Just keep practicing. If you can do it IRL you can do it on the sim.  It will click at some point.
"Guaranteed no load cell brakes. That’ll help, but at 400ir there is plenty for you to learn and watch on YouTube, etc."
load cell brakes.
"If you don't have a load cell brake pedal, road is going to be very hard compared to ovals. Once I got a load cell brake pedal, I could actually feel the can braking and brake confidently"
Watch track guides to get braking points
"Watch YouTube videos for track guides.  If you can’t execute the turns and braking points they show then it most likely means you need to practice trail braking quite a bit.  If trail braking isn’t a problem and it’s more of you just misjudging your braking zones the guide videos will really help you pick out things you would never look at otherwise as references and you’ll start to do this naturally and eventually won’t need YouTube guides.  

You can also “watch” a race in progress and after watching the leader for a couple of laps you can “join” the race by test driving as a ghost along side everyone.  SUPER helpful tool that anyone who is new or struggling should use.  You learn braking points so much faster"
"In my humble opinion, it sounds like you could benefit from some AI racing. You can learn the tracks and the basic race craft for them on your own, and every time you wipeout, you can just restart.

I’m trying to get into a routine of doing a AI race a day before I do any official races."
Start using a telemetry service to compare your laps against top racers as well.  Shameless plug for Garage61 which is free.
The biggest thing that always helps me is making sure my ghost car is on. The ghost car gives me incentive and something to go off of!
Don’t underestimate the power of the ghost car in test drive mode. Drive slow laps then increase a bit at a time! It’s super fun way to practice in my opinion!
"Keep practicing and take some breaks when you're not performing well, I started iRacing last season and besides a win in my first couple races, I've had nothing besides a few podiums since, after a few bad races I took a short break, just jumped on for a couple races tonight and won 2 back to back races in the gr86."
"What made me a driver is just tackling a difficult track head on, i did bathurst/mount panorama for 100 hours and i can easily say it improved my skill level tenfold and im only 3 tenths off the gt3 record (with my theoretical being closer). And now 1 second on most the other tracks. Mount panorama introduced trailbraking and braking in a straight line and racecraft. Would highly suggest tackling/time trialing or finding lobbies on a track like suzuka, nurburging even, spa."
In road course racing it's harder to predict crashes.
"OP,  there might be two things going on here. The one that I haven't seen addressed yet is to make sure that your physical setup is working for you. Is your field of view / camera settings setup correctly? Are you pedals calibrated correctly? Take a look at the pedal input bars and make sure that what you think is max brakes is actually max brakes, and make sure that 0 input is actually 0 input. It'd be even better if you get an overlay that will show you your input traces, and then get a feel for the pressure needed for different levels of braking. If any of those things aren't matching up, you're making life a lot more difficult. If you have experience at local tracks but you can't make it past turn 1, then I think that there's something with your setup that isn't working for you.

Like others said though, keep practicing. Load a short track that's easy enough to learn. Something like Tsukuba. Watch a track guide, but only watch it to learn the track layout / racing line. Don't try to match their pace. Take the corners SLOW. Don't be afraid to accelerate, but lift off throttle well before the braking zone and brake way earlier than you think you need to. Do this until you can not only make it around the track, but you make it around the track *smoothly*. You over-slowed the car and had to accelerate well before the apex? Don't start pushing your braking point back; instead, brake less. This will let you get a feel of the car, your pedals, and the track without needing to worry about precise braking points. Once you can do that smoothly, then you can start pushing your braking points back little by little."
"I am a real racing driver and I offer sim lessons. In real life I will race late model stocks, pro late models, 600cc micros and trans am cars please feel free to dm me"
it's kinda normal to crash at breaking point
"What pedals?  Without a load cell brake, road racing well is next to impossible.  Also add haptic feedback."
"Here's my advice, not that I'm anything spectacular. But I do OK and have fun.

I really try to focus on immersion/realism. This means never using the driving line and just trying to drive like I'm actually in the car in terms of taking risks. Maybe not quite like it's my car and I'm paying for repairs, but also not like I'm on a suicide mission. Especially if you're doing real track days, this should help some of that experience carry over.

This means when you're learning a new track, you're starting slow. Brake early. And note on track where you're braking with some reference. Is it where the curbing starts? A car length after it ends? Right at that dark spot in the pavement? Lined up with the 200 board? Whatever works.

If it's overwhelming, just try a corner or a section of the track at a time and cruise the rest really easy.

And if you made the corner, hit the apex and had extra room at track out, then try pushing the brake point back a little bit and/or braking a little less hard to roll a little more speed through the corner. Just a little. Basically like you'd do if you had your car on track in real life. And then repeat. Eventually you get it dialed in. And just like in the real world, if you're progressively pushing it in this way, when you do make a mistake and overcook it a bit, it should be just a little, and it should mean you can correct for it and usually then it means overslowing, missing the apex, and losing some time, not flying off the track into the wall. One more point on that, and again it really goes back to just trying to immerse yourself and pretend you're in the car and things matter, but if you sense you've gone in too hot, focus on what I just suggested, accepting that you screwed up and losing a bit of time, but not losing the car. It's good practice, and even though you don't have to pay for repairs, if you're constantly binning the car, you're always going to be on cold tires and you're just never going to be able to get into a rhythm. If you were in your car on track and realized you braked a little late, you'd instinctively go in a little deep, overslow the car and do everything you can to stay on track to avoid going home on a flatbed/ambulance. It's all too easy in the sim to try to be a hero in cases where it's just not possible. Or isn't possible at your current skill level.

Personally, I like doing most of this in public practice sessions. I virtually never do a solo practice anymore. I find that just like in the real world, having some other cars on track helps get a sense of where I stand and learn a few things here and there, whether that means chasing faster people or passing slower ones. Obviously just stay out of the way and don't wreck people! I'm rarely the fastest but I'm also rarely the slowest, and I also rarely crash the car, at least in practice. Spinning or going off track happens of course, but I usually manage to avoid hitting stuff. Again, just like I'd try to do IRL.

In terms of setup, if you're just on a single monitor that might not be helping. Triples or VR (I prefer VR, personally) REALLY help in terms of being able to keep looking ahead through the corners, gauge your speed, etc. Obviously lots of people do well with a single monitor, but if you're expecting real world skills to have more or less direct carryover, the equivalent of driving with blinders on isn't going to help. I think successful single monitor driving likely requires a different set of skills. Maybe an additional set of skills is a better way of putting that. For me, I look at the sim at least partially as training for IRL kart racing, so whatever I can do to try to make it as much like the real world, I do."
"Been on iRacing 9 years.  First 6 neglected road almost entirely.  Regret neglecting road.  Hit 4k in oval last year.  Goal for this year is to get to 2k road.  If I could go back 9 years I'd have done a much better % mix of road and oval.  I think the road makes you a better driver (more well rounded).  

Start digging.  Embrace the suck and try to get better."
"Looks like someone reached out to help which is awesome. I almost guarantee you are over-driving the car. Some things in road racing are counter intuitive until you understand the fundamentals. For example, adding more steering angle will not turn the car more in some cases. Road racing is all about weight transfer and grip levels. In order to get the car to turn you must transfer weight/grip to the front tires, braking, and as you add more steering angle you must bleed off brake pressure, trail braking, it's this dance that allows you to be fast. You can't ask too much from front tires as there is a limit to the amount of grip available. Car rotation always involves the brakes not just the steering wheel. If you brake heavy to slow down then just let off of them completely you are actually transferring weight back to the rears before you turn which leave the front tires without much grip and thus you will understeer off track."
Get garage 61 and lay your telemetry over the top time's telemetry and you can analyze the differences in your inputs
Practice
"go slow until you can go fast. You're overdriving on tracks and cars you don't know.  


You may need to lower your fov. Take a tape measure and measure you nose to your monitor and click monitor in settings and calculate the FOV for you.  


Look ahead. Road racing is hitting your marks every turn every time every lap. You are more racing yourself. When starting I gave people tons of room. Faster than me? go ahead. They'll spin out eventually any way OR be actually faster than you.  


You need to go around the track to go around the track. Look up trail braking. Weight shift.  


The apex weight shift you feel on APEX in OVAL is what you're looking for but on every turn in in road. Trail braking gets you there."
I’m also 100% happy to help. Shoot me a pm if you want I race Porsche cup cars mostly
Being good at ovals means you know how to handle a car. So the problem must simply be that you aren’t taking time to learn the track. It takes hours of practice per track
"Laps laps and more laps.
I took 5 seconds off my times practicing in a Miata today. Raced once, qualified 5th! Finished 9th with no spins or crashes, but i went wide 6 times, got passed with 2 to go but that’s ok. 10 series points is 10 series points and fun is what it’s about.
And I took the license info off the header on the UI for a few months."
"Same man I’m just consistently a few seconds off consistent pace I just keep locking up the brakes or don’t trial brake enough, I think a load cell might help but I just keep trying ai races and test drives."
"At least you're not bad at both lol.

Best part? Buddy of mine that's 3k+ asked to see some of my driving. Showed him. ""Oh, your lines are fine""

Yeah I know man, I just don't know how to use the brake pedal lmao"
"Check out Suellio Almeida. He'll get those good habits in you so that you're not practicing the wrong things.

Like the other poster, if I had the time, I'd be happy to run in your passenger seat and work it out, too! :)"
"As an IRL racer i just can’t accept that the second you’re off the racing line, the track turns to ice and your car oversteers. For first lap, I always increase brake bias to cause understeer and avoid big problems."
Sounds good to me. I hope you have some patience😂
My man's doing the Lord's work for us all
Sign me up!
"I’d disagree with that. The line is a good reference to start and recognize brake zones. Once they can make laps without crashing or blowing corners, then turn off the line and try to improve lap times. I just started road a week before the Daytona 24. The line definitely helped me learned the brake zones. Then once I was comfortable, turned them off and watched/followed faster drivers to see where I could improve."
"Listen to this person, take the classes. This will be the most efficient and you don’t have to schedule time with a coach"
"FF1600 is a much better starter car, it teaches you all the fundamentals of weight transfer and managing over and understeer 


Also you actually get to shift gears "
Is it really hard to control the Vee? I was really struggling with the MX-5 because I’m coming over from driving a manual ‘94 NA one and it just doesn’t feel the same at all. I can carry my speed through any windy road or turn in real life but it just doesn’t seem to translate and the car doesn’t feel right
I was waiting to be belittled in this manner but no it’s every turn being good at ovals and not road is a hard life to live lol.
"IMO if he can’t make T1 without the line, telemetry is going to be too overwhelming until he has developed some more skill. He needs to just watch some videos and learn the braking before he dives into telemetry. I wouldn’t recommend him diving that deep until he can string a few laps together at a reasonable speed."
Waste of time lol no one needs that
Also I did nothing but watch Suellio Almeida Videos on YouTube for the 3 weeks leading up to the purchase and arrival of my equipment. Studying I feel like helped me a lot.
"His kit is the least of his issues right now.

The guy seems to not know how to learn a track or drive safely. To me, this indicates that he has a complete lack of spatial awareness. No brake is going to be able overcome that deficiency.

This guy needs to learn to open his eyes and pay attention to what is around him. Stop looking straight down at the racing line as it is clearly inhibiting his ability to see what else is going on.

If he wants to learn a track, his best bet is to go slowly on both edges of the track, one at a time, slowly increasing his speed until he finds the limits of what is possible. After that he just needs to learn how to approach a corner, then use his noggin to adjust as necessary.

Getting better is literally trial and error for the most part, then becoming consistent."
"With 400ir you don't need load cell brakes, you need to watch guides, practice, and stay away of people on races."
More like fundamentals.
"I've been doing absolutely fine without load cells, they aren't even remotely necessary at OPs irating. 

I'm sitting at 1.2k using a completely stock G920 and I have a lot of room until I start outperforming my kit."
Thanks!
road racing is nowhere near impossible without load cells lol - bro is 400 irating. the g2x pedals have a decently heavy spring you just have to modulate/know how much pressure you can do vs KNOWING how hard you can press etc.
"Oh, and one more thing I used to do sometimes when I was having trouble crashing a lot. Just to get myself into the mindset I described above, I'd set a hard limit for myself: if I crash the car, my session is over. I'm shutting the computer off and doing something else. Again, just like IRL. Well, less the repair bills and potential injury/death, but still, give yourself a consequence for crashing and you'll crash less. It'll probably mean you're going slower, but going slower and not crashing is a far quicker path to finding pace than going 11/10 and crashing every other corner."
Shoot me a pm
I'd be happy to help as well.
"I'll offer the same. 3.6k road driver. I'll offer a free session just to give you some tips.

Even better if you teach me some oval ;p"
lol wouldn’t go that far. Just your normal racer. Remember the struggle out the gate
"lol. Open to all sub 700 open wheel road racers, low low price of zero! Learn from a non alien above average man!"
Idk why you are being downvoted into oblivion but from personnal experience it has helped me a lot and it doesn't take my attention away from all of the other drivers. It really is helping when you're learning a new circuit or when you're a new player. Watching track guides can help a lot too for optimal gear changes and racing line once you feel like you can't improve your lap times.
For some of the new tracks that I’ve never seen a race at it definitely has helped me figure out where the track is going and where the really slow turns are. And definitely the first 15 or so times around the Nordschleife
"> Also you actually get to shift gears 

3rd gear all day for me, thanks"
Because you’re comparing a 94 to a spec Miata lol
"The vee likes to spin, so any shifting or braking while turning can send you out if control. Once you get the hang of it, you can feel when it's starting to go and correct it. "
It’s the brakes huh
"Yeah that’s totally fair. Based on their oval expertise my thinking was they’d do well to just see the data for how much they have to change their braking, but a lap guide is probably step one either way."
💀ok buddy
"Well, everyone has a different feel and things that work for them. I could be sitting at 1.2k with my G920 if I wanted to, but I much prefer getting up to 2.5k so far and how the load cell pedal feels and reacts to my inputs"
This is what having these communities is all about. Slow clap.  Bravo.
You’re a good egg
"Well i've ended with 400 and cant seem to go more over it 😞, some help, a lot of help neded here too"
"Yeah. I forgot everyone here is a professional race car driver. I don’t use it on ovals, but since I just started road, it has definitely helped learn the course. I’ll turn it off once I feel comfortable."
Yeah and yet the ‘94 feels like it handles better 💀
Yeah I started to notice that as well
He's admitting he isn't good at road racing - You're being condescending because you have heard of trail braking and got to 1300 irating lol
"unless you're battle for podiums in top split, you absolutely do not need it lol 

I got to 2k irating off vibes alone, and its a very good time"
My point is that it's not unreasonable to say that OP can triple his irating without being told to go out and buy new gear. I have no doubt that load cell pedals will help eventually but giving that advice to someone who seemingly can't do a single lap without incident is laughable.
"1.2k is triple OP's irating bossman.  


HE shouldn't spend $300+ on pedals he doesn't know how to utilize on road until he can utilize the pedals he does have... It's not an equipment issue lol. You can brake and trail brake with G2x pedals... I did it down the nords on any sim for years with my G27. I've had a moza and loadcells for a week and JUST got them into a rig. The difference is monumental, though lol."
This made my morning 😀
Almost 3k irating racer here and I keep the line on.  It's just another reference point for me that I convinced my brain into recognizing and not to rely on.  It's a video game at the end of the day and I am taking advantage of all the tools it provides me.
"Of course it's pretty useless on oval tracks but it does help for road tracks. Don't let these ""professionals"" tell you what to do, you know yourself better than them. I wonder how good these guys would be on a real track, in a real car."
"I had exactly yhe same issue, I've owned about 7 mx5s/miatas and none of them were as light or difficult to drive as they are on iracing but you do get used to it."
the '94 is probably significantly lighter
"I got to 2.3k irating without any other external things, but it helps. How are you supposed to know if you’re braking too early? Or braking too much? Or holding the brakes for too short or too long? It’s not hard to read telemetry. It can help for any skill level."
"Oh no! You said the G word! But yeah, Even a sim has its limitations. Whatever helps us learned, I’m all for it."
"It helps you to stay on the road but it doesn’t help you to go faster or to learn how to overtake.
I don’t use the line even for tracks that I don’t know, all you need is youtube, look a good hot lap, take the braking points and go. Practice is the key not a line on the asphalt"
"Fun fact, I was a professional driver for a little while. Not hard to pick up lines and brake zones IRL. But in this sim, I’ll take the help for practice."
Also probably not on r comps that need to warm up. Or there is a disillusion of the actual pace of the cars.
"yeah for sure it helps and I've used, but its just not fun for me to race that way imo. I'd rather be 500 irating less on average and have more fun doing a few warm up laps and getting right to racing. It stops being fun when I'm spending too much time caring about my irating"
"That's an interesting fact. The difference is that you can actually feel the car in real life so it's easier to know if you're going to understeer/oversteer or not, when coming to a corner. What serie were you running in?"
"Same here, I only do about 10-15 minutes of practice before going into a race. But I do it with telemetry and it doesn’t take tooooo much time. I don’t know how there’s people who spend 3 hours practicing for a rookie Mazda cup race"
"A local short track series in PA, WKA Karts before that. Nothing spectacular, never televised, but still a pro nonetheless."
"I believe you need to map the macro to the chat command. Here's a list.


https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000133518-session-admin-chat-commands"
"Use the ‘F’ meter in game to see whether your R or G times are higher. Change the meter display to text to see exact MS times. 

I suspect you’ll see a bigger boost from CPU/Mobo. For iracing tech I’m not sure those 2 graphics cards will differ much, whereas you would see a marked difference with a new CPU."
"id go for 1. compared to ur gpu, ur cpu is a lot older. i dont think ull see a lot of performance gains if u upgrade to 4070 (comparatively).

imo the 7800x3d is just a good chip as a whole, and u definitely cant go wrong with upgrading to that.

edit: i will say tho, i dont have any experience with VR, so i may just be speaking out of my ass"
"CPU very important for VR, went from 9700k with 2080ti to 12900k and kept the gpu.

Was such a huge upgrade, went from struggling to buttery smooth 1.5x SS 120fps with most high settings except HDR. Still fairly CPU limited on race starts. If you want HDR you'll need a big GPU too but otherwise CPU is the most important."
CPU + mobo (that will mean a memory upgrade too).
"Download more RAM.


All jokes aside I’d do the CPU and MOBO. You have a really good card there."
CPU first and then immediately your GPU will be a huge bottleneck :P. Sorry!
Im usin the CPU/GPU combo that describes your first option and I'm very happy with it. Running my Quest 3 at full Res at 80fps with mid settings. I also upgraded my CPU last year. The 3060ti might not be the strongest but iRacing is more CPU bound.
"On the quest 2, with a 5800x3D, a 4070ti and 64gb of ram, most of my settings are maxed out and I run with a consistent 71fps all the time"
[deleted]
"yes, DDR5 memories are going to complete the bundle."
"I knew that upgrading ""one half"" the remaining would have become a bottleneck...No worries!"
On my system with a 3080 the 5800x3d is normally the bottle neck
"I deleted it. I thought this was simracing not iracing. Msfs got a big boost with I swaped to a 13th gen. But all my racong games didn't, but I didn't own iracing then."
Very clean!
"Nice moves :D Curious on how you got your replay camera to that angle, looks awesome, cheers"
Well played. That was clean.
"It's such a great series 


Oulton park with no chicanes was an interesting choice for this week though, really difficult to set up any kind of pass "
Why? It’s the black car ahead of you on left that had the speed to create this opportunity for you.
You can open the camera menu on the replay menu with ctrl+f11
Oulton is great with this car in general. I think the layout works fine if you're brave with the brakes.
You just had to be a negative nancy didn't you???????
found the 600 irater
"Yes, I moved the chase camera a bit to the side and then changed the tracking type from ""Car"" to ""Group"". Then it will try to keep other cars nearby in frame as well, making it a bit more dynamic."
both. get the highest position by running clean races
"You should be doing the same thing as a rookie as at any time in your racing. 

Try to finish as high as you can without crashing or getting in a stupid accident. 

The goal posts don't move. That's always what you're doing."
"Focus on fun-nothing else.  Position doesn’t matter, “getting crashed” doesn’t matter, irating doesn’t matter - just find how to enjoy your iracing experience. there is no one right answer for everyone."
"Drive to get the best result you can. That means being patient, staying clean, and taking the opportunities the race gives you.

If something goes wrong and you crash, take your fast repair and get back out there focusing on finishing out with clean laps.

The bar to get to a D license isn't that high. Don't overthink it."
"Being clean, safe, and smart will naturally lead to higher finishes. Take time to recognize and learn different techniques, accident avoidance, braking/turn in points, the use of different lines in different scenarios, etc."
"Good tip as a new driver as well. If someone is driving in a way that’s going to wreck you both, just give the up the position and let them wreck themself. They’ll spin eventually and you’ll get it back."
License is directly related to clean racing
"It depends... Rookies is the time to learn. So try to learn something from each race. 

If you are nervous racing around other cars, maybe start closer to the back. Not with the intent to farm Sr, but so that you can observe and choose who you want to try to race with. 

Want to practice defending and side by side? Qualify mid pack and try it out.

One thing that helped me in rookie was to set a goal once you're in your lobby. If your car number is low, go for the win or podium. If it's mid to high, try for top 5 or 10 depending on the room size. If you have the highest number, try to hang in there and learn something from those guys/gals rather than over-drive and bin it. 🍻"
"Whatever you do, never start from pits. An A license is so easy to get that if you can't accidentally hold an A license then you don't deserve one"
"As a rookie myself I my racing plan is as follows,
Drive the weekly track in test drive for a bit to see what time I get, watch a guide and then work on improving, once I’m about 2 seconds of the pace from the guide I move to open practice to get used to cars on the track. 

Once in the race I give everyone space on the opening lap where I can as awareness really lacks. I only commit to overtakes I am 95% sure I can make and they won’t wreck me out. Most of the time I get a lot of practice following a car close which I’ve found can push then into a mistake and get me through. No clue if any of this is the correct way but I average p5 finish 3-5 incidents a race and have 1600ir with 2.73 sr"
"DRIVE YOUR OWN RACE. Race against the track more than other drivers, especially at first. Practice the car and track you’re going to run, then when you get into the race focus on running the lap times you were able to do in practice. If someone is faster, just let them go. Maintain your pace and finish where you finish."
My priorities have always been reducing mistakes. First stop spinning crashing and sliding off track. Next is stop missing brake points etc
"Finish the race with no incidents, but without just hanging at the back."
"Starting at the back is good to help get a bit of confidence and learn the ropes of rolling/standing starts, etc.  I would only do that for a little while though. Once you are stringing together clean laps go ahead and qualify as high as you can, you need to start getting experience racing wheel to wheel cleanly as early as you can. It’s a completely different pace and lines from hot-lapping at the back.

I farmed SR to get my C license because I wanted to drive the Porsche cup car. Did that and was quickly humbled. Having more fun and learning more control going full send in the Miata now."
"Fastest way out is safety rating.  Be in there, be competitive but the first lap or two needs to be completely passive.  Everyone will wreck in the first few turns so if you’re in p1 or 2, literally hold back and let the carnage happen in front of you.  Even if you’re starting last doing that and being cautious the 1st lap or two, will get you in the top 5.  You can focus on being faster then but still be clean.  Don’t get the brave in the tricky corners.

Especially if you’re in Miata - it’s a total shit show."
"SR is about clean race. If you have that mindset, you will get out of rookie in no time. But also remember that don’t get stuck in that mindset, there are time, you need to be aggressive, there are time you need to be bold and brave. And there are time you need to take risk. That’s all part of racing. I see alot of racers so focus on SR, they just give up position so easily. 

Same for IRating as well, eventually you will be at the level you currently belong to. There is no point in farming or hyper focus on it. If you have 6k rating but you are a 2k driver. You will likely get beat every time, there is no fun in that. 

Just have fun, do your best to win and stay clean. SR and IR are just a number"
SR. Once you get out of rookies IR is more important because most splits under 1.6-1.8k are a shitshow.
"I haven’t been on the service for 3 full months yet. What is most important is to not pay attention to where you finish, getting your fastest lap, or even where you start the race. What matters most is to not get be involved in incidents. Off tracks, collisions, etc. The more corners you race without incident, the more safety rating you gain and that is how you progress through to the next license. Wreck avoidance is the most advantageous thing you will learn. If you find yourself consistently involved in incidents, you are involved. And if you’re involved you’ll have to figure out why and then how to avoid them. I was able to get my C-class license in oval in a couple of weeks and finally started to progress in road because I realized I was pushing too hard too often and that was killing me. Pushing for a low 1:42 at Laguna seca resulted in too many off tracks because I wasn’t consistent. Once I realized I had to drive more consistently, I was able to string together more of those 1:42s consistently without incident and jumped up licenses rather quickly."
"I just got my A licence and started driving a bit of IMSA GT3, it’s extremely obvious who the people that “just raced for SR” are. Zero awareness. 
Qualify, learn to race wheel to wheel. You will have shunts, caused both by you and other drivers. Learning to recognize dangerous situations is such an underrated skill that the “here for SR” people never learn driving around at the back or being super conservative. The best way to learn to how to race, is to race!"
"Safety only. In a rookie race, if you finish without crashing, you're almost guaranteed a top 5. Sometimes the winner will be the only one who doesn't need to pit for repairs. 

Put another way, if you can do a 1:30 lap time but with only 80% completion rate, or a 1:33 but with 100% completion, do the 1:33. 

When you can consistently bang in safe laps, then work on moving to 1:32, then 1:31, etc. But if you're going hard every lap in rookies, you're probably missing out on higher place finishes."
"Honestly, full send 100% of the time."
Read the sporting code in full. Practice until you're safe enough to do 15 laps and go fast babbaaayy
your safety rating will go up when youre not at the back of the pack. crashes happen at the back of the pack
Start at the back of the pack and race clean. Safety rating is key to get out of rookies. You'll naturally gain positions because people can't drive. Don't race to win. Race to survive with lowest safety points dinged against you.
"Just qualify and race, there's no substitute for building experience. This goes for starting, running in traffic, etc.

Make sure to review anything that happens in your race, whether you were to blame or not. The question to ask yourself here is: what signal could you have picked up on / what could you have done differently to not get involved in that incident.

To finish first, first you have to finish."
I'm always shocked how many people say things like they'd rather finish a race with 0x than win. It's called iRacing not iDriving and we all pay a lot of money to compete in it. If you're driving the car on the limit you're probably gonna grab an off-track here and there. The goal should be to get from the green flag to the checkered flag in as little time as possible while being respectful to the other drivers on the track.
Racing and having fun
"Intentional wrecking of course!

Jokes aside, as many others here have mentioned, focus on getting an as high as possible position with an as low as possible amount of incident points. That doesn't mean ""avoid everyone else like the plague"", you can only learn racecraft by well, racing people. Accept that you're going to get punted by accident and that you're going to accidentally punt people (and apologize if it's obvious that it was on you) and remember that the overwhelming majority of crashes are due to stupidity or inexperience and not malice. Also, take it slow. Don't try to rush through the licenses and hop into a GTP or Super Formula at the earliest opportunity. It's easier to learn in a slower car than it is in a fast one. And lastly and most importantly: have fun!"
"Safety vs. finish is a balance.  You can ""cheese"" the SR by just running far off the pack and staying on track and get from R to A pretty quickly BUT you won't know a damn thing about racing.  

Biggest thing for rookies in any discipline is first and foremost stop ASSUMING INTENT WRECKING when you get into an incident.  Vast majority of the time the other driver made a mistake, didn't know any better, or had zero track awareness. 

 Learn how to watch ahead on the track and evaluate who is likely to cause an incident (either solo or taking others with them) and then how you can avoid it before it happens.  Should you back off and wait, should you try to get around them so it's behind you.  

Learn how to spot situations in which it's best to let someone pass because they are either faster than you and holding them up will cost you both time or they are very aggressive and likely to take you out.  

Learn about racing in whatever discipline you choose to run. What are common strategies what are common mistakes.  What is that type of racing etiquette (oval etiquette is quite different to road).  Learn the magic of ""racecraft.""  Just because you can try to make a pass doesn't mean you should in that moment.  

Learn from your mistakes/incidents.  What could you have done differently leading up to the incident, in the moment of the incident, and after the incident.  You can learn so much more from failure than you ever will from success.  

Have fun.  If you're not having fun it's not worth it.  Make some friends.  Have some laughs.  I mean we're driving virtual race cars on virtual tracks with some cool ass people from all around the world.  What's not fun about that."
"IMO, the thing to focus on in rookie and early on is how to identify bad drivers and figuring out how to handle/deal with them. Figure out who to give space and who you can race.

Too many people just focus on staying clean and never learn how to pass or race. Too many people put themselves consistently in bad spots and complain about being wrecked all the time. Focusing on the wrong things makes the learning curve harder as you go."
do whatever's fun
"Both  
If you only aim for the highest position, then you will be too agressive and you will lose SR a lot.  
But if you aim only on clean races you will be too cautious and you will learn not a lot about racing other cars. 

So you need to aim to finish as high as possible with  0 incidents."
"![gif](giphy|Ld77zD3fF3Run8olIt)

I never played it safe. I like winning too much. If you’re working on being faster then SR is completely irrelevant. I haven’t looked at my SR in years. Don’t even know what it is.

Youll never get faster if you’re farming sr. I see sooooo many racers who run midfield at best and the only way they usually gain IR is by avoiding a big wreck and that’s mostly luck. Best case is you’ll string together some decent but lucky finishes and end up in a split you shouldn’t be in and you get smoked and lose it all again.

IMO most fast guys hate seeing cautions and the slower guys love them because it gives them a chance to catch up."
"especially in your rookie days honestly. Enjoy the racing that you do, it only takes one other car around you to have a bit of fun.

prioritise on racing clean, racing is like dancing, it sucks with someone who cant do the moves."
This is the way
"Uhhhhhh no.  

License class means nothing.  I'd rather be in an all D class race with a SOF of 2.5K plus vs. an all A class race with a SOF of 1k."
"Lmao you rushed miata to get straight to the big boy league. 😂

I'm hopefully going to run pcup sometime, but jn trying to really focus in one car for now to finish up some fundamentals."
"I farmed my way into D class just to get away from the MX-5 and honestly the driving standard doesn't seem to be any different, at least at the 1.2k irating splits I've been in. I'm using the GR Cup as my ""rookie"" league and I'm having a blast."
"If you can't do both as a rookie, you're blowing it. And if you sacrifice ir for sr as a rookie, you're just going to be in worse splits when you get your D."
"That also depends on what time of day you race as well. Based on my personal experiences, early morning races are generally good for me to get clean races, but also early afternoon races are usually clean as well even if I rarely do them. Additionally it depends on what split you’re in too."
"After my first month I'm trying to get out of the 1600 zone. Fast enough to out pace me, dumb enough to still wreck me."
"Especially since the bar to get out of rookies is a cpi of like 15, so like 1x per lap. The folks who need to avoid racing anyone to achieve this are doomed."
I hate see cautions because it tells me that I'm able to see a bad rejoin.
Please tell me this is a copy pasta
Why
"lol yeah, GT4 really builds some false confidence 😂. Got a couple podiums in the Mercedes GT4 and figured I was ready……locked up the pcup brakes into turn 1 on my warmup lap.

I can see why people love the pcup though. When you get it right, you feel like a hero.  Maintaining that ever so slight amount of slide on exit and feeling the front dig in and turn when you trail brake correctly is super rewarding."
Hard disagree. I'm not talking about starting from pit lane. I'm talking about accident avoidance which is entirely what rookies is about.
Right and split is determined by IR.
"It's not only in rookies that I see this sentiment tbh. As long as you are not actively taking out other drivers with incredibly irresponsible moves it's fine to race hard and try to win, in fact it should be your goal!"
"Oh yeah, baby, racing for me? It's like rolling the dice with the pedal slammed down. I'm all in, every single time. Safety? SR? That's for the Sunday drivers, not a high-roller like me. My SR's just a number gathering dust. I'm chasing that checkered flag, baby, not points on a screen.

You think you can coast and farm that SR to speed? Nah, not even close. I see 'em, oh yeah, a whole bunch of them, just middle-of-the-road nobodies. They're betting on luck to dodge the wrecks and bump their IR, but it's a fool’s game. They might hit the jackpot once, get a lucky streak, but then they're upped to the big leagues, way outta their depth, and they crash and burn, baby.

Now, us speed junkies, the real aces? We hate those caution flags like a bad hand, just killing our vibe. But the slowpokes, oh they're thanking their lucky stars for 'em, thinking it's their chance to draw a winning hand. They're dreaming if they think they can roll with the high-stakes players like me. So yeah, keep dreaming, baby, 'cause on this track, I'm the one cashing in big, every time."
I literally can't understand half the comments in here lol
"I'm on the struggle bus with the Cayman gt4 right now. I'm just not getting corner entry right. I'm either way too slow or it overshoots and it feels like I'm using the same amount of pedal both times lol.

I also get more exit oversteer into spinning than I'd like to admit.

It's weird cause when I played the game years ago on a desk mount my favorite car to drive was the 911 gt3. Something about mid engine and me just don't mesh atm."
"Disagree.  It’s easier to avoid incidents if you don’t try and pass.  Rookies should be about learning to race with others in close proximity, without incidents.  That includes passing and being passed, all while trying to maximise position"
"I never tried the cayman but I found myself over driving the merc quite a bit at first. I picked up the most speed by making sure my initial brake force was almost immediat to slow down faster, that opened up my exit speed quite a bit"
You clearly haven't been in rookies lately. They have a tough time making it around the track alone.
Yeah I think I need to do that. I was trying hard to not go into abs and I think that's slowing me down a lot.
"Incorrect.  I raced Vee's almost exclusiviely for a couple of years up until 2 seasons ago.  I haven't been outside the top split in a while.  

So rookies is to learn to make a full lap without falling off and then following that they should get out of rookies before learning to race? No."
"You really have an odd barometer for what racing is and isn't.  Making it a full lap without falling off IS learning how to race. I've gained more positions by keeping it on track than I ever will racing side by side. 

Also just because you race Vees doesn't mean you race rookies. You just race in a rookie class. Like I said (and you confirmed) you haven't raced rookies in a while."
These are the best kind of finishes in oval racing.
Nice of you to cause a huge wreck pitting a guy you weren't going to pass for maybe 7th place. #winning
Are you trying to wreck everyone? Lol
"They're all driving serpentine around the whole track for sure but this all happened cause the front group 3 wide all clap doors and lose speed, the truck next to OP on the bottom doesn't want to check up and comes up into OP."
"Nope, he drove down the track. To side draft maybe but still caused it."
I’d almost guarantee something about your seating/wheel position is the problem.
"I rock Alpha U and FX-Pro and modeled my seating position according to Daniel Morad's video ""PRO GT DRIVER REVEALS THE BEST SEATING POSITION FOR SIM RACING"".

I have had 0 issues after driving over 600 hours during the last 5 months."
"Hi! I also own an Alpha Mini and FX-Pro. I run races pretty much every single day, around 3-4 races per day, and so far have had no issues with wrist joint pain. How long have you been using it for, and how often? 

Not entirely sure, but might be worth checking your seating position to make sure you´re not sitting too far down, which may be causing you to overextend your wrists forward when gripping the wheel. 

Another thing to take into account could be how hard you´re gripping the wheel, aka death-grip. Tr to relax your hands a little more while driving, it might help alleviate the pain and will also help you feel more detail from the FFB. To achive this you´ll have to go into a practice and consciously practice not holding the steering wheel as hard. After a few hours practice it will become natural but make sure you really focus on light hands technique until you are doing it consistently without the need of thinking about it every time you´re driving.  

Also, you could try doing some exercises to strengthen your wrist joints a little more to alleviate the pain. 

Hope this helps!"
"I was recently diagnosed with carpel tunnel in both wrists and turf toe in my braking foot. I’m pretty sure sim racing is to blame for these injuries. 

I now make sure I wear gloves to reduce how much I’m gripping the wheel. I also tape my braking foot and wear wrestling shoes to prevent further damaging my foot. I never would have imagined that PPE would be required for sim racing haha"
"This was the issue for me, ended up moving my chair back and pedals closer so my legs were in the same position but leaving the wheel where it initially was, so my wrists weren’t at an acute angle, pain stopped immediately after I did this."
"I set up my seating position using the same video haha, no issues for me either. 166 laps straight (with pit stops of course) at Daytona last weekend on pretty high FFB."
"Thank you for the comment, I raced too 3-4 races per day for the last 2 weeks later the holiday. My seat should be fine but I noticed so much times I grip the wheel too strong.
Specially during the races I feel like I lose the car if I don’t hold it strong. I have to be honest and I’m also frequently hitting the gym so maybe the things are correlated, I’ll try to follow your suggest as soon as my wrist goes back to work to practice and relaxing the hands."
Yup! Did also 6 hours over the weekend in 3 stints. 166 laps straight would be a little too tiring for being competitive. We finished P2 in 16th split on our Gt3 field. Hopefully you did well and had fun!
Check this video https://youtu.be/QOrL5hmS4rc?si=6wog1GhMb0jJMCV7 your hands should not hold the wheel firmly.
"It was my first endurance event ever, I joined a very casual team and the car had been binned a few times before I got in. I was the quickest gt3 when I was on track (3500 iR in a 1800 SOF split) but I was just motivated to get to the end and was the only guy on the team not sleeping haha. Made up a couple positions and had pulled within a half lap of two more but ran out of time. Still had a lot of fun and can’t wait to do it again."
"Our split was 3500, it was struggle because of the 700ir LMP2 field, so count yourself blessed."
"It wasn’t all blessing haha we had 500 irating GTP drivers in our split hahaha. The vortex of danger doesn’t exist at that irating “I faster car, I go inside”"
"The Dallara 18 is on fucking rails, and suuuuper easy to catch with power slides. I fucking love that thing."
"The IR-18 on iRacing is my favourite car in any racing game ever (especially on ovals) and when the racing is good, it is absolutely breathtaking to be a part of. I just finished a race that ended with a long green run at Atlanta and as the tires wear and you become one with the car, literally dancing on the edge but being completely able to trust that the car will do what you ask it to do, is one of the most incredible zen feelings ever. The thrill of it is legitimately unmatched. I’m so glad that so many people love this car the way I do."
dont sleep on the pm18 either.  those two are my two favorite open wheelers. its not as fast as the ir18 but just as fun on road courses.  this week its at phoenix oval though iirc.  the weeks the pm18 go to nords are my favorite weeks on this service
"F4 is probably the most painful series to drive on the platform. Unless you qual top 5 good luck👍🏼

Congrats on getting out of that series"
Did you have a chance to run it at Nords last week? It was amazing! I think once the series gets more popular with the licensing it will attract a good portion of the SF drivers once they try it out. It’s a blast to drive and the mix of road and oval racing keeps it exciting.
Y’all jumped from the F1 game straight into F4? That’s ballsy af
"I make it about 3 weeks in the same car/series before I get bored or I have no interest in the track that week. 

I like to drive one downforce car and one tintop throughout the season. This season it’s the sf23 and 296 gt3."
You should watch IndyCar races IRL too. Much much better racing than you’ll see in F1.
"I'm a lifelong Indy fan, and it's my Iracing go-to! I'm so glad Indy woke up and is back officially in Iracing. I love more people discovering this car and series. I really hope Iracing creates an A class series like Nascar. See you on the track!"
Atlanta? Isn’t it in Zandvoort this week?
road atlanta <3
I wish we would get some longer green runs but oh well hopefully I'll see you out there later today
"I’m in a similar boat where I’ve pretty much only done F4. Spa last week was a mess, I really don’t like the Hungaroring, and I’m not sure how I feel about Jerez. This might just be the push I needed to try something new! Debating either GT3 or the IR18, but I’ve never done Oval before so I’d need to get that license up. Sounds like you and a lot of others enjoy the IR18 though + Indy 500 coming up 🤔"
"It’s a HUGE jump from F4 and F3 to the Indy car, I’m nervous ab the road racing but looking forward to it 😂 fs the first couple times leaving and entering pits it was a spin show for me"
"I love reading passionate comments like this. I’m layin in bed with my wife snorin in my ear, but feel like i’m a ridealong passenger in one of your hotlap sessions. 

Absolutely love the thrill of racing, and watching others experience that thrill is almost just as thrilling for me. The first time i saw these two videos i legit got a little choked up. In the first one (start at 2:30), that breathtaking feeling is plastered all over the passengers face as soon as Jozef gets on it.

[https://youtu.be/PEAcoMcz2oU?feature=shared?t=2m30s](https://youtu.be/PEAcoMcz2oU?feature=shared?t=2m30s)

In the second one, the mixture of excitement in her voice and fear on her face gives me the jitters. I would absolutely smack a baby to experience that ride along, but the emotion in the video makes me feel like i’m right there with them in the car. 

https://youtu.be/DT2jO4JLEJE?feature=shared

My favorite part of both videos is the difference in how the drivers/passengers handle the G forces. Drivers look like theyre out for a nice sunday drive while the passengers are holding on for dear life

TLDR: i need to spend more time with the ir-18"
"The Indy Pro 2000 is definitely one of my favorite cars. Changing the schedule to match the USF2000 has helped participation, but I do wish it would go official more often in the late-night Pacific times (0600-1000 GMT)"
"Last season I drove F4 at Watkins Glen, qualified P17 in the top split, and I was able to finish P2 purely from attrition. 👀"
Having jumped up to SF23 from F4 & F3....F4 was frankly cleaner.
I was doing SF for a little bit and IndyCar is a lot more fun.
"The IR18 was really growing prior to the licensing debacle.  We would usually get 2-3 splits on the first race of the week.  Hopefully we can get back to that, especially if they restart the iracing Indycar series (longer races, usually 2-stoppers that follow the real life Indycar schedule)

I’ve dabbled with other cars like the LMP2, GTP, and SF for a season or two and while they’re fun, I always miss and come back to the Indycar.  It’s just so much more fun to wring out.  Add in the tire strategy and 50% ovals and it’s brilliant."
"Yea it worked pretty well for me (we raced form vees til we got to D and just jumped right away), we all have our strengths n weaknesses so my strength that helped was being overly cautious. Helped avoid chaos lots of races, had to learn to be more aggressive when called for"
"I have been wanting to get into, don’t know who I’d root for, don’t wanna bandwagon but don’t wanna be bottom of the pack"
"Never mind, fixed and open run different circuits."
"Last night I had a couple early cautions, but then it stayed green from lap 10 to the checkered.

Right at the start 3 people spun when they pushed the throttle on green. 🤦‍♂️ The yellow came out after only 2 people had crossed the start/finish, so we had that fun bug where the pace car goes out in front of P3, and then all but 2 drivers got a wavearound one lap before the restart."
"Even when maining the F4 series id run oval to give myself a break, it’s refreshing to have almost nonstop wheel to wheel racing, and admittedly sometime warming up w an oval race is exactly what u need to get ur braking foot warmed up and ready to rock a road course. I’d highly suggest giving it a try!"
"Just a suggestion, race the AI for awhile until you are used to the car or track. I know you can practice but it's good to know where a pass can be made. Also to practice passing on each of the corners. 

Or you can just do that in an online race. It's just annoying when someone tries an impossible pass at a bad spot and crashes you out. But it's your sim so do as you will."
https://discord.gg/ppDQavxU this is the discord most of the indy pro drivers hang out in. Usually 7pm PST race gets people but just ask around if anyone is interested in the 9pm PST race. I'd join you any day of the week at that time
Open wheelers are full of the worst drivers so not surprising
100% agree. Much easier to manage imo and the tire compounds add a bit of strategy
I don’t root for anyone I just watch the races.
"That’s what I did for Atlanta, but nothing is as good preparation as just getting in a race and trying ur best. Already excited to see all the tracks"
"Well u gotta have some favorites! Like I started watching F1 in 2020 I think whenever drive to survive came out (like most American fans) lando quickly became my favorite driver after watching some races live and it’s finally paying off, I need someone to root for! I’ll def give it a go this year that’s for sure."
I don’t personally haha. I just love racing and IndyCar is an amazing racing series.
"Ignore the advice of anyone not using a Quest 2 and telling you to go down an openxr rabbit hole. It's a complete waste of time. This sub is obsessed with overcomplicating VR.  


 iRacing's quest mode is very well optimized for the Quest 2 and it's super simple with just a couple of tweaks to get the game running great.  


 First: Are you using a proper optical usb c cable? Are you using a high speed usb port on your computer? Without these everything else is a waste of time. 


Second, tweak the resolution and refresh rate directly in the Oculus software.  


Third, play with the graphics settings in iracing to get a stable FPS that matches the refresh rate you selected in the Oculus software (72 or 90 depending on your hardware).  


Then if you want even more performance, manually set the bitrate in the Oculus debug tool (this is optional). "
"dunno if it's the same for quest 2 - i have a quest 3.... but the biggest tweak to make for blurry textures was to leave the oculus app multiplier at 1.0 and then bump the resolution as far as you can with the openxrtoolkit.

also, bumping the bitrate in oculus debug tool probably helped."
Welcome to a deep deep rabbit hole. I have an oculus 3 and basically bought a super computer to power it and I still am often bothered by graphics quality. You’ll spend 40 hours on tutorials and videos before you find the right combo of apps and settings
"Yeah welcome to vr. I used an oculus rift for sick racing in 2019-2020 and absolutely loved it. I for sure noticed the blurry affect at first but you get used to it and being in vr out weighs that problem in my opinion. 

I run a single ultrawide monitor now because I have a daughter and more stuff going on at home that I can’t completely block myself out from the real world. And I don’t think I could go back to VR at this point. Monitors and seeing all my equipment is preferable for me."
"You can tweak some settings and use OpenXr to try and mitigate it (there are nice tutorials on YouTube specific to Iracing), but overall it'll always be blurry and overall less ""crisp"" than a monitor

You kind of get used to it I admit"
Did you turn up the resolution in the Oculus Software? Its set to1.0x as default.  I also recommend to look into the Oculus Tray Tool to bump up the Bitrate.
"If you're using a Link cable, by default the video steam bitrate is pretty low. Open up the OculusDebugTool and set the Encode Bitrate (Mbps) to 500 (maybe lower if your hardware struggles) and disable Encode Dynamic Bitrate. It will clean up the compression in the video significantly.  


Edit: Here is an explainer of some of the settings in the OculusDebugTool: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/pqtyqj/how\_to\_change\_the\_image\_quality\_of\_oculus\_link/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/pqtyqj/how_to_change_the_image_quality_of_oculus_link/)"
"Yes, I borrowed my son's headset for 2 days, and out of the box settings are pretty bad. I messed with a lot, I know I ended up at 1.4 or 1.5x on the multiplier, and 90hz (these were a little tricky to find in the occulus software).  I think the thing that helped the most was setting up the "" **Recenter HMD button** "" mapping under controls, then you can move your head forward to back, recenter and it pops the perspective closer or futher away (for me everything seemed too small at first).   I wish I bookmarked the links I found, but there are some good config guides and posts here to explain everything."
"Also have Quest 2. The fix is to use oculus tray tool and set the multiplier higher than 1.0. I have mine at 1.5 with various graphics turned up and down based on the balance of fps/detail I want. After playing several games in VR since getting the quest last year I've learned that it does take some time to tweak each game to look good and still perform well. But the multiplier is where to start. Playing this in VR is absolutely great, I love being able to look left and right to see where cars are and to find the apex. Enjoy!"
Have you gone into the headset settings and increase the resolution in the graphics preferences?
Haven’t tried this method yet. I currently have the oculus app bumping it up to like 1.5 or something. I’ll try using it at 1 bump up resolution with openXR instead.
How do you bump resolution up in openxrtoolkit?
This doesn’t sound promising haha. Hrs and hrs of tweaking and still not getting it to look like it should. Idk. Might just have to give up the idea of VR.
"Always makes me feel more immersed, it's like tinkering with a car setup. Do you think race engineers have a YouTube tab open on the side?"
[removed]
"This user used a first generation VR headset five years ago and yet is still coming into these threads giving out completely incorrect advice. 


You don't know anything about VR in 2024 so why not just stay out of these topics? "
"don't do this, this sub always give the worst damn advice to Quest 2 users "
not at computer atm but it's right there on one of the tabs - it should hopefully be self explanatory.... but i'll post something later if you can't work it out.
"Don't let these people discourage you.  This sub is really terrible regarding VR optimization, it just leads to a bunch of people with zero technical knowledge vomiting all kinds of misconceptions from outdated VR guides. 


Assuming you have the right hardware there is only one set of settings (in the Oculus software) you need to play with, everything else can be done directly by tuning the iRacing graphics settings like you would with a monitor anyways. You don't need any external apps. "

Where do you see this?
Some one likes to fish.
nah obvs very happy and tryna brag a little bit but genuinely surprised cus im 3k irating and have raced against people a lot faster than me (at least 0.5 seconds a lap).
"Racelabs, think you have to pay tho"
I’d also like to know

"Looks like you've lost it actually if you look it up on the official iRacing world records page. You're still second, which is no slouch.  


[https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/worldrecords.jsp](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/worldrecords.jsp)"
Don’t ever pay for that scam app. The owner will charge you without notice then pretend it didn’t happen
"was trying to find this page, thanks mate, I raced against the Mehdi guy in first, hes an alien, unbelievable pace"
my guy just learned about subscriptions
"Google it. The owner of the company decided to charge people without permission.

He’s shady as fuck and shouldn’t be trusted. If you don’t mind being charged over your existing subscription then that’s fine you do you. But I’m never trusting him w my credit card again"
"I have like 100+ PS actions at this point. One per car. 

Some of the newer cars are annoying because updating the spec map causes the main paint to have a file lock by iRacing, causing PS to fail to save. For those ones, I just disable the spec map save steps unless I need to update the spec map.  "
It’s an amazing feature that if not for a passing comment from a mate when I first started using it I’d never have figured out. It’s one of those super powerful tools that’s hiding in plain sight
"I wrote a little script for it, only condition is that the filename needs to start with the name of the folder of the car, no more 100 actions for me 😝"
Yeah I've seen the script approach and tempted to do it myself but it would take more time than the 10 seconds per car to create an action. 
I’ll drop a gist here tomorrow when I get to the pc
"It’s somewhat aggressive, you weren’t super alongside prior to the braking zone but you made the move stick. Rubbed a bit but that’ll happen from time to time.

No one’s race was ended so id call this a dub and it was a nice pass too.

Leave a little bit more room in rookies and don’t start trying to pinch people out of the corner until you get into higher iR splits and out of rookies. Everyone’s spatial awareness in sim racing is already very poor just due to how computer screens and fov is designed and people in rookies typically are worse because they’re not used to having to check or look or be predictable anyways."
"No, you were racing"
"I would add here - notwithstanding that it's rookies and you should leave as much room as possible simply to account for everyone's lack of experience and awareness...
...but in pure racecraft terms, this wasn't just fine, but conservative.  With the amount of speed you carried into and through the corner, your exit line was easily on track to leave the guy way more than a car's width at the track edge.  The contact was down to his lack experience and/or awareness - he left you enough room at apex, but continued to turn in such a way as to exit down the middle of the track... normally, it'd be entirely reasonable to expect someone to take a line that maximised their exit speed (ie, running up to the edge) and what he did here would be considered turning in on you.

Overall, a good move I'd say."
Aggressive but very much a racing move in real life.. sometimes the comments on here annoy me due to in real racing the aggression in road racing is great but on I-racing everyone gets hurt by one little touch.
"Aggressive and clean, no harm done"
"Try not to get in the habit of swapping paint. Make sure you're able to slow down enough to hug that inside curb, rather than drifting towards the center. If you can't slow down enough, then wait to make your move.

Remember, sometimes just getting alongside of them is enough. You'll go back and forth swapping positions for a few corners, but that's the fun stuff. Not all passes happen in a single corner."
"Great pass. The only ""issue"" is that you tracked out too soon. Gotta wait for that ""clear"" call from the spotter before you do that. If you would have slowed down just a tiiiiny little bit more, and kept an inside line through the pass, it would have been 10/10  


The contact is on both of you. If you would have stayed a little more inside and he a little more outside, would have been no contact."
"Yeah biggest thing I see is you need to stay tighter on exit.  You did a good job at establishing you had the inside line, but if you want to be a clean racer, you should still give him the outside line to be able to battle until you are completely clear, then you can move over.  Practice makes perfect though, the more you battle, the more you learn proper race etiquette.  Keep on grinding buddy"
"Looks okay to me outside of the minor bumper rub. I’d advise a slightly slower mash on the throttle on corner exit to minimize the chance of rub. Specifically speaking in Mazdas, don’t expect your opponent to know you’re passing on the inside (looks like they turned in a bit when you traded paint there). Otherwise it looks to me like you outbraked the other car."
"No, he left the door wide open. Small racing incident that isn't even your fault, wouldn't worry too much about it. From 00:02 the corner was yours and you left more than enough space on the outside.

Also, you were probable within a hundreth of a second behind him so it wasn't a dive bomb either!"
"Backed out, no. However, you should have stayed more on the inside. The contact happened because you went slightly wider on the exit.

The fault is on him because he saw you and still hit you, but it's always good to know what you can do to avoid incidents even if you're not at fault."
"Yes, he was going to take you.  Best to do that in the slowest portion and not compromise your exit - tuck in, get a tow and lose as little time as possible.  

Racing someone side-by-side is slower.  If a pass is inevitable then find the best place to make the exchange and lose as much time as possible."
Ya didnt end your day or his. Yeah it was optimistic and it stuck. Move on.
"It’s aggressive, kinda like Verstappen. But don’t see anything wrong."
Excellent pass. You left then plenty of space on the outside and they left the door wide open. The minor contact wasn't your fault.
I think it was ok. The other car could have tracked out to the left a bit more. This is one of those cases were you're really trusting someone else to see you coming. Doesn't always workout so I would not make a habit of it personally.
Racing incident
Just a lil lovetap that's all there is. This is racing so some little taps tend to happen in races' like these. No body died so its W in my book.
Thanks this has really helped! Will work on getting a bit more up along side in future and keep it tight to the inside. Defiantly feel the special awareness issues.
Amen. I don't understand why people find this aggressive?
"Thanks for the insight on this, glad to hear I’m attacking overtakes in an acceptable way!"
"Also, you are playing against others with limited vision (single monitor) so often when you are next to someone you just have to hope both players keep their line for fair and good racing. 

On higher ratings you can be a bit more aggressive as they tend to have better spatial awareness, better vision (VR/triples) or they can use the look left/right button well. But even then, netcode can mess you over."
"People on this subreddit are very conservative, like racing is the same as passing someone in the interstate"
I keep hoping for the Mustang
Lemme get that sweet sweet corvette before Nurburg 24. It won’t happen that quick but I dream 😂
Give me the corvette. The C6 GT1 and c8 gte are amazing cars.
"There’s a little car called the McLaren 720 Evo, they should scan that one. The current McLaren Gt3 is old."
The Matt Malone twitter schedule picture is just a picture leaked on the iracing forums. The orignal post that put it up says it's specifcally from the Multimatic mustang team.
"Really hoping for Mustang GT3 and 4, but REALLY hoping for that DarkHorse with the manual. I drive the FR500S the most out of all the cars. I love it, but I wouldn't be opposed to a modern car like that getting added. The GT versions would definitely incentivize me to move into GT 3 and 4."
shut up and take my money.
Made a comment on a multimatic post that they need to bring the mustang GT3s to iracing and the multimatic account liked it...so yeah it's coming.
Please fucking replace the 12 year old McLaren too.
PLZPLZPLZPLZ
i just want the mustang.  the new corvettes have been really underwhelming to me
"If the Mustang ends up in iRacing I'm officially jumping all the way back into iRacing and driving that thing forever, buying whatever tracks I need to in order to race it every week."
"I really hope so. I'm super new to iRacing so it's not like I've been waiting long, but as a big Mustang guy, I would definitely drive the hell out of it."
"Even if we get it, I don’t really think it’s going to be on the roster, unless they increase the car count by a good amount"
As much as that Mclaren needs replacing I'll dearly miss the flamethrowers it has installed in the exhaust
McLaren doesn't license their newest cars out to racing games unless it's somebody else licensing it to the game and they have to comply ala ACC
INJECT THIS INTO MY VEINS
"I do better in the Ferrari than the AMG, but I’m going to do everything I can to make the Mustang work"
Don’t hurt me like that!
"The car count is what, 11 or 12? There is plenty of room for another GT3 car."
"Haha, that’s the exact reason I chose it as my main gt3 car. Shooting fireballs at my enemies behind me."
"There was only one TCR car last season, and staff did want to add at least one more when the car limit was increased to 9, but couldn’t because they created a car-specific class instead of a TCR class. So expect at least one more TCR, and I’d also imagine that if they’re adding another GT3, it will probably be the Audi Evo 2. That would make the car count 12"
"Last year we stuck to 8. The limit is now 12.

I would expect 5x gt3, 2x gt4, 2x tcr, 1x pcup, 1x gr86

The extra slot is probably most likely to go to a gt4 to make it 3 but part of me would like to see the mx5 and gr86 go against each other in a single class. They're close enough."
People who only jump into this series because it's on a super speedway are ruining it for everyone else and need to go back to crashing in draft masters.
Yeah once I started racing even just the indycar oval series that requires a single fuel pit stop at one point I was hooked and that was it for sprint racing in either road or oval. It’s just superior
"The regular B class NASCAR Legends series goes to Daytona (50 laps) in two weeks, after a [throwback to 1998 next week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_500_(Motegi))."
"In my race last night a guy hit the wall slightly and then his whole front end turned into the entire road and I had no opportunity to slow down.

32 minute required repairs, 7 minute optional.


My car was so beat up from that one incident I couldn't even accelerate anymore."
Lol super speedways will always get the most sign ups because they are the most fun in these cars. Who are you to gate keep the series? Some people just don't enjoy short tracks or road courses in these bricks.
"But aren't you glad they aren't ruining all of the other tracks for you, just Talladega? Also, if you're really good on iRacing, those drivers aren't even in your split. I do wish the inexperienced drivers in the 1987 cars would practice more in AI just to understand you can't run the 'pedal to the floor' with these cars especially since they can reach 220 mph going into turn 3."
They are bricks for sure and a pain on the short tracks. But at least run some practice please.
"I mean. They ain't bad drivers. Just inexperienced with the fast brick, lol. AI practice is always recommended."
No doubt
im voting matt malone for president
Matt’s the reason I got into Iracing. Caught his stream on twitch and within 2 weeks I had ordered a gaming pc and wheel and pedal set. So cool to hear good stories like this. Makes me proud to be in the community.
Great to hear! Solid move from Mr safety rating.
"I rarely watch streams but if I do, it’s Matt.  Such a good dude, glad to hear he helped you out.  I hope he doesn’t start getting constant requests for his gear, now."
"Matt is a great guy, streamer and racer.  His D24 streams at Tony's place last weekend were one of the highlights of the weekend for me."
Matt Malone hung out in my air bnb and then ate one of the decorative sea shells on the kitchen table! Nice guy tho.
"I’ll jump on the bandwagon and share my own Matt Malone story. 

A few years ago back MOATFF put on a charity race. You bought tickets and on race day you got paired up with an iRacing celebrity. It was a mix of big name aliens and well known streamers. I was lucky enough to be paired up with Matt. I didn’t really know of him as I didn’t watch a lot of streamer(boomer alert). 

Matt could bot have been a nicer person. We had a blast. I put on one of my best drives and really made a good show and a lot of his viewers had gave me props. It was one of my best iRacing experiences. 

Matt ended up giving my team recognition when he uploaded the video which was super cool too. 

On a side note, I got to trade paint with Jimmy Broadbent in that race too which everyone got a kick out of. Maybe not Jimmy"
Matt has always seemed like a good dude so this is awesome to hear. He is the reason I got into sim racing and then eventually iRacing and I know I’m not the only one. Thanks for sharing
"Matt is the reason I enjoy iRacing. I was putting myself under so much pressure over winning and making consistent progress towards lower and lower percentiles and hated myself when I made mistakes. Seeing Matt just have fun and take things lightly made me realize I was approaching iRacing the wrong way.

Now I get it. I've seen him enough to just understand that this is a hobby and it's meant to be fun and not a second job."
"Matt Malone is one of those guys where you just know he's a good guy.  
I just enjoy his youtube videos of his streams in the morning :)"
"Fantastic post OP. Matt is indeed a treasure. He ascended with his coverage of the D24 at Tony Kannan's sim den with Quirk and Dan Suzuki. He'll soon be doing the usual Bathurst 12hr solo, get in on that.

"I am the proud owner of Matt Malone's used webcam, including the spit!"
Matt definitely making fans for life with that good guy move! Thats great to hear about someone doing something awesome like that for the community.
Thanks for the story and thanks also to Matt to let us enjoy iRacing even as viewer + grandson of 4.
I’ve been watching Matt since I got into sim racing and I always watch his videos. Glad to hear he’s just as an excellent guy in real life as he seems in his videos. What I admire in Matt that he doesn’t take himself too serious and he takes a light hearted approach to racing incidents. I try to do the same and just try to race without caring too much about losing iRating.
"Holy smokes y'all, this turned into quite the gaggle! Thank you for all the positive feedback and for sharing some of your own stories as well. Someone asked for links to Matt's channel and someone was nice enough to post his and Dempsey's info as well, thank you for that, I'm almost a boomer and on my phone. Really appreciate it and one part of the story I left out was me paying it forward. I was able to find a friend of a local Iracer and I donated my G920 and peddles to a guy who needed some help too, that was part of what sparked me to do this, I got a text from the kid saying he got his C license and is having a blast, that brought tears to my eyes and I am happy I shared. I'll say one last thing, everyday when I get home, fire up the computer and sit down to race, I think of Matt and how much he changed my life, coolest part is everyone in here knows exactly what I mean."
You never walk malone
Damn that's awesome. I've been watching Matt for about a year now.
Subscribed! Thanks for sharing.
"Oh man you had me worried until I read the post to the end, good to see Matt is a good guy even off the stream, him and casey are the only streamers I seem to watch these days"
"This is what I love about Simracing and iRacing in particular.   
  
There will always be some toxicity in online gaming but compared to other niches or even other racing sims....we stand apart.

Post like this showing sim racers helping each other out so that we all can have a great gaming experience is what its all about.

Matt Malone is a legend on and off the track.  
  
Much love to all you racers out there!"
"Matt Malone, the real American hero."
Nice. Thanks for sharing! He seems pretty genuine the few times I've come across his stuff.
"If Matt Malone is anything like Moses Malone, I guarantee he's a good dude. Btw good story"
I must admit he just seems like a genuine and nice person with a killer charisma. I'm really pleased he could help you out.
Ole’ thunderfoot Malone really is a gem.
brilliant post.
This is so wholesome. What a guy... GG Malone!
What a great story. I just followed him on Twitch and will check his content out!
"Malone is a great guy for the community, I really enjoy his content, and hopefully, I'll get to rub doors with him at Sandown this week!"
this made me tear up man
"Matt is awesome. His positive attitude is really great to watch and certainly inspires me to be more like that in my racing and day-to-day. 



It was also nice to see him get a shout-out on the iRacing news section a bit ago."
+1 for MM. One of the few streamers i'll take hours out of my busy schedule to watch.
"i was sooo worried when i read the title, thinking that there was a problem/issue with Matt. Glad to read it was exactly the opposite! Guys like Matt are the reason this community is absolutely amazing. He's done so much good for the sim racing community."
"Matt’s very genuine and an honest ambassador for our sport.  I really enjoy the light hearted atmosphere he brings, and the way he reacts with laughter to a mistake or someone else’s error shows his true character - good guy."
Matt is one of my favorite streamers and watching streamers is not really my thing at all
"Matt Malone might be one of my favourite people on this planet. He's such an easy watch and always engaging, and he's always positive despite most issues he's facing at that time, absolutely love him.

I still remember the first I saw of him, if anyone else remembers. He was doing the Spa 24hr in a Ford GT3 and somehow managed to beach it on the tyre barrier while a teammate was logging in to take the next stint haha"
Sounds like a good dude. Can you link his channel in here? I’m not a twitch myself but it’ll make it easier to find him after reading in here
"Good Guy MM.  nice story, I like reading nice stories."
GOAT iRacing streamer
THANK YOU MATT
I'm a fan. More now. Thanks for sharing. Pretty neat!
Well this is extremely heart warming!
This quite the gaggle!
"Level-headed and always a joy to race against in the Mustang.


I remember once he door-checked me onto the grass (just hard racing and he got loose on corner exit as I was crossing over). I lost the rear on the grass and came back into him.


We survived with no real damage. Chat wanted me hung, but he called like it was."
"Thats awesome, thanks for sharing!  Matt is one of those guys you feel you can joke with right away.  Great dude."
"RIP Matt Malone’s inbox.. 

Glad to hear he could help you out though!"
You opened this up like he did something sinister 🤣 glad to know he's the good guy I thought he was
"Malone and Quirk have me sorted for iRacing content. 

Love watching these guys and with how much I think they've done for iRacing, It's nice that they have found a lot of success with streaming."
"Matt is the only iracing content creator I enjoy to watch tbh. Very positive and his approach to the whole game/sim is something we should all strive for. Punt or get punted, start first or last, be on pace or not, it is still a game so just have fun with it."
"I wasn't subbed to him before. But after reading this, I am now!"
"I used to watch loads of streamers a few years back and as time went on I watched less and less as I found so many of them got really annoying. 

If I watch a stream now though (well it’s usually a pre recorded bit on YouTube these days) it will be Malone. 

Seems to have such a great attitude from what I’ve seen on streams and I’m glad from the OP’s story that it seems he’s a stand up guy in ‘real life’ too."
That's really awesome of him!! Nice story. I've always thought he seemed like a nice guy.
Bless up Matt Malone
"I absolutelly adore to read this! Congrats on Malone and the great gesture, this is one of the things that bring me the most joy in the world, seeing someone go the extra mile just to help others! I always say that we already have enough quick guys that act like douches on stream, disrespecting people and now we need someone different that shows kindness and respect. Malone may be it. We still need more of those people, but that's very refreshing to see! Cheers!"
"Poor guy is going to get so many DM's now.

On a more serious note I completely agree with the general outline of your post. He seems like a really decent hardworking guy and along with the other people you mentioned it really makes me appreciate the general sim racing community.

For me bottomsplit has been really inspirational in a way. Initially it seems like everyone is racing in these expensive rigs and then you have this person who's just having a good time on his Logite wheel trying to not take things too seriously, while still being a driver I can learn a ton from."
Awesome post.
Hey what kind of car do you drive in Real life.  😀
This is rrally damn cool I didn't realize how nice of a guy he really was
"Man I started reading this fearing you were gonna say Matt beat your puppy with a club.  Glad I was wrong.  Matt rocks, he seems like such a good dude."
Everyone likes Matt. What a guy!
"Agree, Matt Malone is great.... what you just told us doesn't surprise me. Matt is a true down to earth iRacer and I love hos channel. Thanks for telling us your story 😉"
This is what a good community is all about. This is awesome! Thank you for sharing!
Matt is the man
Just gave him a sub on youtube!
This brought tears to my eyes 🥹
Tony Kanaan gave me a GSI Formula Pro Elite that was custom made for him with his logos in it.
never forget the 4 or 5 p's
"Much like a lot of folks here, Matt was the reason I first got into to iRacing all those years ago. I don’t play currently but when I do get the urge I always check out his stream. He’s an awesome streamer and one of the few people out there who make you feel like you’re a part of a family. Kudos to him and to you for making this post."
"Dude, Matt Malone is the fucking man"
"Matt Malone is definitely an IRacing role model for me. I remember seeing that one of his children came in during one of his races and I swear I almost cried. I’d love to be like him. Stay at home dad just racing and helping others then having my own family?? Sign me up, that sounds like the least stressful way to live and I’m all for it"
"love when those who are in a position to give actually do so when the opportunity arises.

Great for the community, and for all the fans.

Love the progress, keep it going!"
"Malone is a real one, a good dude, and the best streamer in the category. He’s responsible for so many people being hooked on this fun hobby … myself included."
Great story. Way to go Matt.
"I mean, you can see from light years distance that he's a good human being, even without metting him in person. He's a fundamental part of the iRacing/ sim racing community but I don't know if he fully realized it yet."
Good dude and a blast to watch.
"First off, wow! You guys are so nice to say such kind things about me. 

Obviously none of you have been on the wrong side of my bumper on track. Hahaha

The iRacing community continues to surprise me with its generosity and wholesomeness. I'm so grateful to be a part of it."
I just subscribed. Good guys need to be supported
"Great streamer, great racer.  Exemplary man."
Malone is mr iracing the lord we all deserve
"I spend way more time watching Matt Malone and Dave Cam than being on the Sim haha.

Could watch Matt all day"
The only iracing stream worth your time. Maloner seems like an excellent person.
""" never tries pushing crap on us ""

&#x200B;

Unless he's flaunting his 5000"" samsung odyssey super mega crazy ultra wide!!! Matt and Dave Cam are the two I watch most but on youtube because they live on a different planets timezone to us Aussie's."
Never heard of this guy before this admittedly but I’m glad we’ve got dudes like him around in our community
"Look at you, making a post about matt being a good guy, like we didn't know already. 

I am happy he is getting the viewership he deserves."
"I doubt you've done him a favor with this post. Poor guys mailbox will overflow with ""give please"" messages. 😂"
"Nice! I watched his Daytona 500 video yesterday as I'm interested in getting into some oval racing (no GT4 or GT3 content this week is making me look elsewhere...) 

I'm glad this turned out to be a good story rather than a bad one!"
"I second this, don’t know the guy but at this point I’ll vote for anyone that wasnt born in ancient times."
"Malone is a good dude, entertaining streamer, hilarious, but no chance am I voting him president, lol."
I'm writing him in and no one can stop me
Malone-Gurney 2024?
And Quirk his running mate!
Of the world
"until he gets drunk on stream and says the most insane things. but hey, ppl forget quickly"
"Given the other options available, I'd expect him to romp home. :)"
"I can hear his ""HUEHUE"" laugh at this!"
For president in Russia pls !
Same here he and many others got me into iRacing and on Saturday I did my first ever 24 hour event which being the Daytona 24.
"Same here, I first got introduced to iRacing through Matt’s Daytona 500 stream in ‘18 or ‘19, can’t remember, (it’s the time he won.) Ever since watching that I was wanting to get iRacing. Finally did shortly after the pandemic!"
"Same, I'll never forget the clip of him going down the backstretch of Bathurst putting sunglasses on and binning it 😄"
"I asked him if he was ok with talking about it. He brought it up on his stream yesterday, I would have taken it to my grave otherwise"
"That what I was thinking, unfortunately a lot of people will be asking him for free stuff now"
"Dude, that's not how you use the three seashells! But that Malone guy is top notch."
😂
"Very true, if something bad happens in a race Matt can laugh it off"
"Be honest, did you lick it?"
"I’ve talked to him a few times, and I think he just turns his real self up to 11. Just a wholesome energy to have around, and a pillar of the community."
You basically mirrored my thoughts. It’s amusing watching his chat try to pop off after an incident and he’s always the voice of calm & reason even when it’s not his fault. He continues to hold down a real job & kills all the ads he can on his streams too which is refreshing to see. All these streamers trying to make it a full time gig. Matt easily could but is like nah.
Unless it’s for the Bathurst 12h
"Not sure if you saw Casey’s VCO award post, but he said that on his first stream Malone raided Casey and as he put it “the rest is history “"
TY :)
"Yeah, I like that he is willing to fight, but he is also super fair and if he was wrong he accepts it. Love watching the Mustang and Mazda races, always good hard racing, Skippies too"
"Wow, just seeing that Dave Cam's YouTube channel has been hacked"
"I think that is what makes his streams enjoyable, everyone seems to get along, Matt acknowledges everyone in chat, really impressive. How he drives in tight races and continues to keep chatting I'll never know, if I get tapped on the shoulder while I'm racing it's a distraction. Seems like he is ramping up the contents and his community, I wish him all the best in continuing to grow and be the best streamer."
"Hopefully some of us in his community will go on to streaming and help grow it in exactly the way you are describing. I know that Dempsey's streams are a blast too, ""I wanna see your balls on the wall, come on now, balls on the wall""!"
"Yes, Bottomsplit has shown that you can do it on a less expensive piece of equipment. It's really impressive to see him run with some big names and be really competitive. I found oval to be a little easier to race on my G920, road is a little harder. Having the feel in the wheel when you get loose really helps me, I find I save many slides I would have spun out on before. But I also know Gustavo Ariel got to 6k irating or something like that using a Logitech G29, so maybe I'm just old lol"
Thank you
"What do I drive in real life, you ask? Well, I drive a 2012 Chevy Malibu 4 door Blue in color with 144,000 miles!"
Nice
"I'm a grown ass man and when the box arrived and I pull the stuff out, it brought tears to my eyes. Truly one of nicest gestures anyone has ever done for me."
"Wow, he is another one who does so much for people in the community. Obviously he has built a bit if an empire and he shares what he has. I know Quirk does a lot to help TK and in turn Quirk gets to share in the spoils, not that Quirk doesn't do well by himself"
Thank you
"He actually works a seasonal job in construction, so he gets laid off in the winter, which is pretty sweet. I always laugh when his family comes in while he is racing. I’d lose my mind, but he stays cool. He really is an icon in the Iracing community and it’s great seeing him get the appreciation he deserves."

"Wait a minute, is this Dave Cam’s YouTube account replying? 

I hope you take to heart all the great things people had to say, I’ve been watching at least 4 years now and you’ve always entertained, educated, made us laugh and raced your ass off, so thank you for what you’ve done. 

Looking forward to many more years of great content and happy to be apart of it. And once again, thank you for your generous gift to me, a life changer."
"Yeah, me too, even when I am racing his stream is on my phone playing"
"Lol, I never said he isn't a peddler, just ask Coach Malone! Now get out there and put a hat on someone!"
"He mostly races road stuff, but he is a two time Daytona 500 winner as well"
"Yeah, me too. Really almost everyone in his chat are great people too. Very little crap and lots of laughs and honestly Matt is a good driver, he has some epic battles with some right side by side racing. And when he messes up he apologizes and moves on, something we can all learn from"
"I really enjoy the Malone v Broadbent beef. All in good fun, but always find it funny."
things you disagree with aren't insane.
What did he say?
Point me to it. 😂
Or lets his dog piss inside lol
"Hopefully people will be respectful, Matt gave away his old set of peddles after the D24 through a raffle. I'm assuming going forward that is how he will donate stuff. I cimmented to another comment that I did clear it with Matt before saying anything and he talked about in stream last night with 600 plus viewers"
He'll get his three seashells epiphany moment at some point. We all do. ;)
[love how he’s always so chill!](https://clips.twitch.tv/TemperedBlueClintPeanutButterJellyTime-gkN4EoZLXJM4xJA4)
I am not Demps.
Yeah he sounds old a great guy to have as a friend. His kettle korn video is hilarious. I bet BBQ’s at his place must be a hoot 😂
"Wasn’t Matt recently made redundant from his job? I hope he finds a new one soon.

In terms of doing sim racing for a living - it sounds great but then I usually think.. “if your hobby becomes your job, then what’s your hobby?”."
Underrated post right here.
"Thank you, made me smile today. Have a great day!"
Quirk is a very nice guy. He helped TK build his simracing warehouse. That place is amazing. Tk is planning on doing some events there this year.
"Lol what’s the source of this? I watch a ton of both of them (well no Malone streams, only his uploads on YouTube) but never encountered this yet."
"I mostly agree with you. But there was one time, Matt advocated abolishing the Federal Reserve which is an insane take. lol"
"He has the political leanings of your average midwestern white guy in his 30s

To reddit that is ""insane"" tier though"
"He doesn’t “let” his dog piss inside she’s like 16 years old, dogs have issues at that age"
excuse me what
His moustache has really calmed him down it seems like lmao
"I was watching a stream about a year ago. Was historic Monza, multiclass in Mustangs and Mazdas (IIRC) and just remeber Jimmer yelling ""MALONE"" as he got overtaken."
Why does it really matter what an iRacing streamer has to say about anything other than sim racing though?
Is it though?
"I mean depending on the takes you're talking about, some of those can be insane lol

the average midwestern guy thinks abortion should be illegal even in cases of underage rape , that's insane

not saying he thinks that, but you should probably be specific, but I'm scared theres a reason why you aren't lol"
You didn’t mention exactly what he said though. This guy said he said insane things.
"It doesn’t, it was just an interesting and funny observation."
I’m not being specific because I don’t keep an excel spreadsheet of iRacing twitch streamer political takes to pull up for reddit arguments
Damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
"These knuckleheads is why on T1 lap 1, you have to watch your mirror so heavily and turn out if they come a knockin."
"Honestly there needs to be suspensions for bad driving..this will go down as racing incident as far as protest even though we know it's not. This will never stop. Every split, every car. I see it every race. And these guys know most the time the other driver will try to avoid a collision and they will get the spot. I don't understand."
Average Ferrari Fixed race
Some people drive like they're racing against AI
"ooofff i run that livery, time to switch"
Heck of a rejoin incoming from the dark blue car.
It's always the people causing the wreck that get away free while you sit there thinking wtf?
"given your username i'll just say:

""his ambition outweighed his talent""..."
"Correct. I think that I was not able to see him in the mirror.. I was checking P3 and P4.
Sad, cause I had good pace but is good that I am not that upset with this things anymore."
"Consistency is key to race performance. 

The trick is, you can’t really be consistent at 100%. If you can, then you weren’t at 100%. Your absolute one lap pace should be dangerously on the edge. 

What you need to learn to do is find a comfortable pace a few tenths off your peak pace that you can comfortable sit at all day long without issue. A pace that allows you to adjust quickly without being so on the limit that you end up crashing; and a pace that gives you headroom to push if the need so arises. 

Another thing that is a VERY common beginner error is overdriving and pushing too hard. In a race it’s so easy to become tempted to go a little faster. The truth is the time to “go faster” is practice. Once your pace is dialed in, that’s your pace. If you know your pace, and the person in front is doing two tenths faster than you’ve ever done; resist the urge to just brake a little later or push a little harder to catch them. 9 times out of 10, that ends in a wreck. 

Now these are broad strokes strategies. There’s always an exception to the rule. (For example, we’ve all probably picked up pace in a race because we noticed someone faster doing a slightly different line, tried it, and it was faster. Even that is risky but it’s way more viable than just trying to stay on the throttle more or brake later once you’re already in a race). 

I look at it like this: Who am I actually racing? If the guy in the lead is half a second faster than my fastest ever lap, I’m not racing him. If he wrecks and I pass him— neat! But I am never going to find six tenths in the middle of a race on a track I already have hundreds of laps on. That’s insane. But if I look at qualifying laps, practice laps, etc. and find a couple of guys really close to my pace, that’s who I want to beat. And my best chance of beating them is to run my “fastest safe pace” throughout the race, pushing when it makes sense to push, and staying consistent. Because MOST people are punchy and inconsistent; so if you’re consistent you’re going to be amazed at how fast you really are. 

The fastest drivers don’t look the fastest. They’re smooth and relaxed."
"Practice against AI. I usually change the AI rating to between 30-80 depending on the track. Also join a real online race that's already in progress and test drive as a ghost car along side the actual online drivers in the race. You can drive around with them or pit and watch the drivers in the replay from their cockpit to learn what methods they're using IE brake points, what lines they run, how much throttle on exits etc..."
"You need to be understand what is causing you to make that mistake in order to fix it. So if you don't know, find materials to make you aware, like youtube videos or coaches. Once you understand why you made the mistake, you will just need to keep racing (practicing) to not make that mistake. 

For example, are you locking up the brakes while braking over a crest? Understand that the car is uncompressed while going over a crest and you need to brake less hard. And that you can brake MUCH harder while the car is compressed, like going uphill while braking, etc.

&#x200B;

Sometimes though, you may understand what you're doing wrong and it's just an input issue and you know that you dabbed the brake a little too hard. These happen and you will never be perfect, but just practice."
Had someone tell me to try and practice for 90%. Don't push for the 100% be consistent first. Practice against AI is nice because then you also have to worry about traffic and not just the perfect racing line.
"You just described every racer, from a very beginner to an F1 driver. Yes, everyone strives for more consistency as the more consistent you get - the closer to the maximum theoretical speed you can get. 

And yes, it all comes with practice. I personally find endurance races great for it, but if you are just beginning then maybe driving for over 2 hours straight is not your thing."
"Great question. Do I get better at this thing the more I do it? 

Hmmm let’s think about that one."
Yes.
"Short answer is yes. Long answer, yes but also practice with AI, I’ve been doing it more recently and it really does help"
I had no idea you could ghost drive amid a race going on! Thanks for this
It’s a SUPER handy feature.
Welcome
Yes it's a very good experience
"Sure, but did you ever shit bricks going 2-wide into a tight corner thinking there could be contact at any moment so keeping it to the outside or inside as much as you can, only to then look at the replay and see that like 2 cars could fit in the space between you and the other single-screen driver? Because that's fun too"
"My triples helped last night: I saw a guy right before he t-boned me on a straight. I have no idea how he ended up going sideways and completely flipping my car, but thanks to my peripheral vision, I was able to curse before flipping. "
"Triples also buy you better, closer racing and thus more fun."
Equipment absolutely can buy you iRating
I configured 2 buttons on my wheel to look left en right. Works for me.
"Try vr,  pimax 8kx + ability to shoulder check = always knowing where fools are."
VR also does wonders (especially if you don’t have space for triples). Better equipped usually does buy you better consistency - especially load cell pedals.
Nice and smart move
"Do you think triple monitor surpass 49 inch ultra wide?
I use VR but have been seriously thinking moving to multiple monitors or a single ultra wide one."
"A good radar like ACC should be allowed in iracing, that would be a good start.

Edit : I took a look at racelab, seems ok but expensive.
Are there any great simhub overlays?"
Just wait until you try VR.
"nowt like being in the car, there is no going back to pancake."
So does a 170° fov headset and also a spotter 🤪
"Interesting. I have a 34inch curved wide screen & have been thinking of triples for “another level of immersion”. 

Unfortunately I don’t have friends with triples to test if they make the field of view better :("
"I'm about 2 weeks into triples coming from a 34"" UW, and its' been great, but the funny part is, how bad I am at judging the right hand side still, I always blamed the single, but at Charlotte I smacked the wall quite a few times still. (tin top obviously)"
"Equipment has not bought me much iRating, but has definitely bought me a lot of SR, lap consistency, and more enjoyment of the game."
"That’s me, i have $1k in my trip monitor mount and monitors, but $600 into my rig and wheels and pedals"
"Btw, equipment buys you practice efficiency and feel. Those two things equate to iR and SR if you don’t have 10 hours a day to practice."
Triples buy me a front row seat to people exploding my car. 😑
"I feel like equipment won’t buy you irating but it’ll give you more feel for the car which is what some people need to drive better. So in some cases I feel like it sort of does but having a wider FOV always helps

When I say sometimes helps, I have a friend with a 1.6k road irating who doesn’t use force feedback. Absolute psychopath but he does in fact drive better without it."
"I mean, if triples buy you safety rating then equipment definitely buys you iRating. A good load cell pedal and to a lesser but still significant extent, a DD wheel are easily worth a few tenths at least to the majority of simracers."
You can always tell when someone is running single screen because they leave WAY too much space when you're going side by side. I did the same thing when I ran a single. Triples are basically a necessity at this point.
"I dunno. I felt like my VR headset made me a little bit faster, at least in open-wheelers. I had a better sense of exactly where my car was on the track and what it was doing.

I didn't notice the same improvement in tin-tops, but that might've been a skill issue. I just plain sucked in tin-tops."
"Alternatively, head/eye trackers help too"
"VR is even better, and less expensive too."
"Do you rate them above a cockpit? Playing with load cells bolted to wooden floor with a dining chair wedged in position, I really feel my limit is being able to make fine adjustments with the brake. I’m currently on a 27 inch screen with a desk mount. I’m thinking about what to prioritise next."
"im gonig from a g27 on a table to  


moza r5 - tm tlcms and triple 1440ps with a gt lite pro rig basically overnight lol itsw nice. brakes and wheel rules but brakes are too heavy so i need to mount them and if im going all out i might as well get triples... rig delivered today... last monitor arrives this weekend lol."
FAX
Last week I physically ducked as I drove under a rolling f3 car in VR. equipment bought that safety I guess
Tripple ultra wide or vr. This is the way
I think it’s more difficult driving in VR than with a 49in ultrawide.
"Are we just looking at how he missed his turn in, but the other car drove off the track?  And he claims he knew it was going to happen and backed off?

Congrats OP!  Triples are cool, but this doesn’t really show why."
And this is why triples trump VR overall.  VR is amazing but it doesn't give the same peripheral insight to whats happening alongside.
Well done!
Oh- hi Jay! Didn’t even realize it was you. Cool clip! Triples are great- Andrew Murphy
"Just got G9 NEO, it’s amazing that I was playing on a 27in G7 before. I’m so much more confident in my car placement."
"I can definitely see how triples would help with peripheral vision which can definitely be helpful in certain situations; however, I think the spotter and good positional awareness are usually sufficient to maintain a good safety rating."
First day with triples and it’s a world of difference
"That used to be me every time. I used to lose so much time racing wheel to wheel because I gave waaaay too much space. Now that I know where they are, I can place my car more accurately. I was in a Gridlife series race last night and spent half a lap side by side with someone. Less stress for sure."
When I was using triples I still had difficulties to comprehend how much space there were left or right side of me and I ended up giving too much space. I also had difficulties to understand how much there were space between me and the car in front so I always thought I'm almost touching the car in front while in reality there were still reasonable amount of space left. Moving to VR fixed these issues for me. Of course VR has other downsides compared to triples. If I only could have triples in VR.
So triples helped you curse more efficiently. I couldn't ever go back to racing on a single screen.
That is definitely true.
I gained a pretty substantial amount of speed and consistency when I got a load cell brake.
"Yeah was gonna say I feel like, even tho I’m not maximizing by equipment by any means, that a wheel not clamped to a sliding desk insert, load cell pedals, and a rig that doesn’t make my legs hurt like playing at my desk, would definitely improve my times"
"Just installed new Simagic pedals yesterday. Crashed repeatedly in testing before I started adjusting to it. Then started noticing my braking was naturally smoother, I was getting more rotation, you could feel how trail braking was rotating the car like I never could with cheap pedals. Wasn't even focusing on any techniques, on purpose, and put up a fastest lap in my first race. If I'm running fast laps, with brand new drastically different equipment and not actively not trying to focus on specific techniques, I'd say that you definitely can buy irating with a pedal upgrade from cheapos"
lol theres 7k dudes on g29's on a desk. cope harder.
I just strap a 6 inch screen 3 inches from my face
"I found that the snapping threw me off. I’m now battling with VR, trying to optimise it 😆"
"In terms of FOV, yes. A 49” is effectively 2 monitors. You will get a fair bit more peripheral view on triples (assuming the monitors are at a similar distance).  The part you need to ask yourself is if you would prefer the simplicity/convenience of a single monitor or the increased FOV of triples. Dan Suzuki has a good video on YouTube comparing the view, so you can check that out and see if you think the extra fov is worth it for you."
"iOverlay works pretty well. i *think* it has a radar, but ive never used it


edit: forgot to mention its completely free apart from needing to join a discord for the activation license"
iracing doesnt give data for how close the other car is to you just if theres an overlap so unless iracing changes that all the radar will be roughly the same
Racelab’s radar is free and it’s the same as ACC
at least for if you spin and need to make sure its clear before trying to spin around. not every vehicle has excellent visibility.
I refuse to. The less I know the better.
"I believe the key is the FOV. im coming from a HP Reverb which is about 110 FOV at best. Going to triples from a 110 FOV is actually mind blowing. I never expected that i would like triples equally to VR, i have been doing Sim racing in VR for about 3 years if not more.

what bums me out with VR sometimes is that just a game update could break your optimized setup. Latest AMS2 updates broke the VR experience for me which was one of the factors i finally went with triples. the other factor was for showcasing the sim rig which i find clunky to do with VR. I love both but right now i prefer triples.

&#x200B;

Only a large FOV VR headset can bring me back in to VR on PC. it also have to have no hassle software.

What VR headset do you have and what GPU do you need to run it well ?"
"May I point you to this video from Dan Suzuki - https://youtu.be/pp7njDB5YtU?si=Vnm4UoSpW5xr1FKJ

I was in the same boat as you; and still only own 1 34” UW (a proper stand and 3x 32’s is pricey :( ) but that video absolutely changed my mind on my decision on triples"
I used to really suck in tin tops. So I focused a bunch of time in them and now I still kinda suck in them sometimes. But not as much.
Not when you consider what kind of computer it takes to run with decent graphics.
"Eh, yea you may want a rig first."
"Amazon has a GT OMEGA Apex stand, bought it for like 150$, worth it imo"
"Since I had triples, I was able to see him all the way through that corner complex, and see that he didn’t brake for the right hander when I did."
Go into a practice with a friend or so and crash into them.   No...  I'm not joking.   You need to know how much space you can squeeze before making such contact.   Get the feel for the car.   And its size.   When you feel the wheel jolt and see the car right on ya thats the point of contact.   Same thing for walls.   Oval racers crash into them all the time just seeing how much room we can actually squeeze fpr the precious tenth of a second.
"Same with a DD Wheel. I dont think it has to be the best or most expensive but the fast and direct feedback helps a lot to save some slides and with driving ""on the edge""."
"I tried my brother's rig once and was even more crap than at my usual setup, with a desk clamped wheel and an office chair. 😁"
I definitely both got better and had a lot more fun when I went from a desk with a desk chair to a full rig. It's a big investment but also a big improvement.
Prove it
that is quite literally what VR simracing is lol
"Absolutely couldn’t do the snapping so i relied on the spotter when i used pancakes. Now that i have VR, i will never go back, not even triples"
"I noticed a big difference in ACC when I got openVR, was already using it when i started running iracing, but would recommend."
"awesome response, thanks ill check the video you are referring to!"
Looks good. It's more like a spotter (can't see lateral distance) but I think you can't get more in iracing. Thank you
Take a look at the relative for that. If you see the car on the radar in that situation it's way too close
You'll never be able to go back to a monitor once you race in vr. It's incredible. Having actual depth perception and the ability to naturally look around makes such a huge distance. I can bump draft in oval no problem now and race in really tight packs with confidence that I won't be the cause of a crash.
"Pimax 8kx and a 4090. Also I have always heard people complain about th pimax software and I don't know if it's all been fixed and is mainly a old issue as I have never had a problem once literally plugged it is chose my fov etc run it in openxr and havmt had any issues at all just works.

Glad to hear your having a great time though 👍"
Love-ly! Thank you so much. Literally the type of answer I was too lazy to look up. 🙏
Dan has some great videos.
"I have a 7700k and a 3060ti.  I can run iRacing almost wide open at 71fps on a Quest 2. 

My PC is probably worth $700."
"As an oval racer, can confirm.

I know when I feel the right rear clip the wall but don't get a 0x that I hit it perfectly."
"Yup, VR and haptic feedback helped me
with car control and driving on the edge of front and rear grip."
Shhh don’t take away my excuse
"You can remove the snapping in an ini file. You can control how long it takes to turn.


That said, triples or VR are definitely better than look left/right"
"> up giving too much space. I also had difficulties to understand how much there were space between me and the car in front so I always thought I'm almost touching the car in front while in reality there were still reasonable amount of space left. Moving to VR fixed these issues for me. Of course VR has other downsides compared to triples. If I only could have triples in VR.

I said the same thing however recently went to triple 43 4k from a reverb g2..... yea haven't even fired vr back up.... the overlays that work properly now to the heat reduction is great and the peripheral vision is just too good. now a pimax with 200 degree's of FOV might change my opinion but until they get the FOV up to 150 plus i still think triples are a better option, and for endurance racing it's a no brainer choice. i defended VR for 2 years quite loudly but larger triples are just a game changers, the clarity and ability to read the braking marker boards and finding the little cues on track to use as a braking marker is amazing. I'll give VR another chance after another generation of them comes out if the resolution and FOV make some big gains."
No problem :)
"I started playing iracing with a 6600k and gtx970 with a vive. worked great, was just a bit too blurry to utilize the cluster. Once I got a 1080ti and index, that changed. Now I can just rely on the cluster for information on the car. You get a really great sense of where the car is in relation to your surroundings with VR"
"Yea, but configuring it to work is a bit of a pain. I haven’t got t running consistently smooth yet."
"And I think that recently changed by default only a month or two ago, from snapping to a relatively quick turn."
"Me neither.  Took a couple days off because I got tired of trying to tweak everything.  Had it at a decent frame rate a few days ago, made a few changes at once and couldn't get above 20 frames.  Need to try to remember what various settings I had in ODT/OpenXRToolkit/iRacing. 

Or maybe I should just buy a better computer."
"I’m not sure it’s about having a better computer… I’ve got an i9, 3070ti with 32gb of ram. Still lag spikes at seemingly random points."
"Fair, I have an i7-10700? (9700?  Can't remember) and a 2060 with 16GB of ram.  Could probably upgrade the card and ram."
If you didn't go three wide with him in the middle you wasted your life.
He is a decent arca racer now irl
"Looking back at Frank's life he has been one incredibly lucky guy.

Star of a popular TV show as a kid and somehow managed NOT to follow in his predecessors footsteps. Then turned that into a successful racing career.

He definitely won the most important lottery of all. He has had an amazing life."
" nice! my claim to fame is getting wrecked by Carson Hocevar who himself had been wrecked by somebody else. What a night! 

  Genuinely love that actual racing drivers pop up on the sim against us mere mortals!"
Malcom’s in the middle… three wide.
"That’s pretty cool! The phrase is ”lo and behold” btw, not low"
Was in the pits with him when he was racing at Road Atlanta years ago in the formula BMW series. He was not exactly crushing it.. Assume if he's stuck with it all these years he's likely to have improved quite a bit. At least I'd hope so. 
Looks like you raced against owner of Knicks and Rangers as well 🤔
"https://preview.redd.it/1vdh9ml9kxec1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5fa07a1a7551f534e81e28b136cd13d45dd9942

He was just in my practice I’m like noooo it’s Malcolm!"
Lol I only knew him and Patrick Dempsey as racing drivers when I first saw them years ago cause I hadn't watched Malcolm in the middle and had never heard of Grey's anatomy. They were both pretty easy going and the typical nice drivers to chat with while wandering around the paddock as a kid. Glad they've done well
"He's come a long way since I raced him a year ago.    

https://youtu.be/_EXWPNkTpYw?si=YAGw-s9vbXBLkeNv

That's him in the 6 spinning out and getting chastised in chat.  Me in the 2 getting held up by him.

Edit: it changed the timestamp when I changed the listing to Public.   This was from about March of last year."
Can you not just use whatever name you want on your iracing account?
"To be clear, I wasn’t saying it wasn’t him. I know who he is and what he does and I also know a lot of other big names are on iracing. I just wasn’t sure how strict they were with the names that you used."
I got to be in a race with him about a month ago in one of the truck series if I remember correctly. I just remember we started near one another (he was a row behind-ish) and he ended up getting collected in the first yellow and then I never saw him again.
"lol, just listened to him on ninjas podcast talking about iracing"
Definitely my favorite show. I'd be wildly stoked.
My boy Frankie been tearing it up these last few years on the track
Claim to fame is racing Gen4’s with Braxton Busch and Street Stocks with Chad Knaus.
I literally just raced against him too. Managed to out qualify him but he ended up winning the race !
"Welp. I now have a new goal in life. 

Get in to a Lobby with Frankie at Daytona. Frankie is on the outside line P2 and scramble my way through the pack. I’m behind him in P4. I get a small run and YOLO it to the outside of Frankie knowing that no one is going to follow me up there and I’ll fall back to the back. Right before this happens I pull up next to Frankie and scream to the lobby “OMG LOOK MALCOM IS IN THE MIDDLE”. P25 totally worth it"
Underrated comment
"Frankie and SVG are doing it right, starting in the lower leagues and not using their celebrity or big name in racing to get to the higher series right away…"
In interviews he talks about how much support he had from his parents and he has never even TRIED alcohol or drugs
"I think it’s because he made that shift, luckily he had constant work up until that point so it probably was a major factor. He didn’t sit around with his money with nothing to do he found another hobby he was passionate in."
Surprised he was wrecked by someone else before he wrecked you…..
"In probably 2005, I was racing in Nascar 2003 in a lobby that only high ranked drivers could join. User named Denny Hamlin is there, he had just hit the Busch Series scene, I ask ""are you the real denny hamlin, he's like ""yeah that's my name"". In qualifying, I lay down the lap of my life (Nashville Fairgrounds) and win the pole over Denny by like .002. I say ""wow, I can't believe I beat denny hamlin for the pole!"". He clearly doesn't like that, because on lap 1 I get a decent start, denny pulls in behind me, and absolutely wrecks the shit out of me. His buddies in the server laugh.

That's my claim to fame."
"That is very cool.

Mine is Tony Kanaan bump drafting me in an Xfinity practice session for a few laps. Turns out he ended up the last driver of his split and I was first driver of mine so I just missed out on racing with him."
I got ass packed into a corner by Quin Houff one time when he overshot a braking zone.
"""not exactly crushing it"" is my iracing motto"
Same here! I think I was in the same practice last night.
How did you not go nooooo Malcolm! In chat lmao
"No, they pull your IRacing name off of the name on your credit card when you sign up."
"No, you are assigned a name based on your billing info. You can ask to change it, but there has to be a reason for it.


The only instance you can change it for something else is for ""privacy reasons""."
"Like others have said it goes off your credit card, but I recently emailed their support and got my middle name put on my display name bc I was tired of seeing a 19 after my name lmao"
Also Frankie drives stock cars in real life now
There may also be more than one person with that name in the world.
He raced in the 2000s and a wreck in I think Formula Atlantic at Mid Ohio pretty much put a stop to his career. Broke his back and almost lost his thumb. He had an Indycar or Indy Lights ride in line until that happened.
"In the late 2000s he was in Formula Atlantics, at the same time as future Indycar drivers Robert Wickens, James Hinchcliffe, JR Hildebrand, and Simona de Silvestro."
Frankie has been racing for years. There have been times he says he forgets a lot if the show because of the hits from racing if memory serves
"> starting in the lower leagues and not using their celebrity or big name in racing to get to the higher series right away…

I agree with you, but SVG won his first NASCAR race he started in."
Unless you message them asking to change it… lol it isn’t too difficult
The reason being ‘I want to change it’ is reason enough. As long as it’s a normal enough name there will be no questions. Iracing just doesn’t want gamer handles.
"I had them insert the name of a food between my forename and last name😂

Hint. It's in my reddit handle."
It's him.  Raced him several times.  He doesn't talk much but it's the real guy.
He said that quote is taken WAY out of context and has nothing to do with head trauma. He said he forgets a lot of the show because he was a child and just like everyone you forget a lot of the details of 20+ years ago.
There are other times he says he forgets a lot of the races because of hits on the show so who knows but we can all agree he has taken a lot of hits in his career.
Do you remember much of elementary school?
I thought he said he was lying about memory loss
"I think he’s going to start live streaming soon, which will be really cool he  seems like a really nice guy to interact with"
"And was mediocre in the truck series on a short oval, which oval is where the majority of the races are. I get the winning part, it was also a track no one knew and he had a hand up driving street courses. Though he put on a clinic for the other drivers."
There needs to be a reason for them to let you change it though. I don’t think they’d let someone go with Frankie Muniz unless their name was that or close to it.
Which you can only do one time.
He only does ovals I assume?
"Other guy is getting downvoted to hell, but he’s actually correct. They will change your name if you email and ask and give any bullshit reason of your choice. I said “I’ve had weird views on my LinkedIn immediately following races with incidents” and they asked “What name do you want instead?”"
Well I can confirm that it isn’t true. I’ve had mine changed to something that doesn’t even resemble my real name. Can I ask what you based your thought process on or is it simply guess work
…your point being?
Is that a new rule? My account has had two name changes. The last time was in 2012 though.
Why would he?
Not sure.  You can always look him up on iRacing and see his stats (most people don't make it private...even the IRL pro guys).
"He's racing ARCA now, but in the late 2000s he ran several seasons of Formula Atlantics, which only ran on road courses. (though even ARCA has a few road courses in real life)"
"So you think if I created a new account tomorrow they’d let me use Elon Musk or Lewis Hamilton as my name without asking any questions? Again, you saying “give any BS reason of your choice” doesn’t change the fact that (a) you have to give A reason and (b) they don’t have to approve your choice, and probably wouldn’t have just let any rando race under the name Frankie Muniz."
It’s in the Sporting Code (2.1.2) and I changed my name the day I signed up
"You’d be Elon Musk2, because I already took Elon Musk when I emailed them before."
It says nothing in the sporting code about your name change having to be similar to your real name
"It says you need to provide a “justified reason”. Given that Frankie Muniz is a famous actor and a race car driver, I think they’d be skeptical of a random person asking to use his name.

EDIT: And here’s him literally [tweeting](https://x.com/frankiemuniz/status/1750282180859961761?s=20) about being on iRacing yesterday."
"So for a start I never denied it was actually him. Also you are correct, you have to provide a justified reason as to WHY you want a name change, not WHAT you want it changing too."
👍
"How on target were you with pit entry speed? If you slowed down too much or too early, you lost time there.

A full extra lap is a very safe margin for fueling, many people put in a much smaller margin."
Potentially they could be fuel saving during the first stint meaning needs to fill less to complete the rest of the race. Possibly then underfueling the car in the pit window planning to do more fuel saving in 2nd stint? I know that’s a lot of potentially and possiblys 😅
"Probably more aggressive on the amount of extra fuel he put in (I personally only fuel an extra 0.5 laps), paired with using fuel saving strategies like lifting and coasting to improve his fuel economy so that he needed to put less fuel in to get to the finish than someone going flat out. He already cut 1 laps worth of fuel out of his pit stop time by going 1 lap further than you did before stopping, and you can cut even more time out of the stop through additional fuel saving over the full race distance."

"Could be a number of things:
-Their pit entry could have been more aggressive/faster
-Rode near the boxes to save some tenths 
-Fuel saved during their stint to require less fueling in the stop. 
-They coasted less/more aggressive into the actual box 
-Legal speeding down pit road (without limiter/go about .5 above the limit) 
-Combination of all of these 

In oval racing, I’m pretty slow on track but can usually gain a spot or two by hard driving the pits and stopping right in the box. Watch the replay and see where they were gaining on you. Pit strategy is an amazing way to get around someone with similar speed"
Maybe you were slowing them down and so when they had space to push they got the jump on you and others.
Think about what 3 seconds is in terms of racing. Imagine a car 3 seconds behind you while on track at pace. 3 seconds is huge.
"No need for the extra fuel. Unless you’re driving drastically differently your fuel consumption will be about the same.  

Once you hit the pit stop races you realize it’s free time nailing your stops. Just hitting your box or the speed limit at the line can yield a few seconds, on the track that’d be really hard to find."
"Auto fuel with zero margin is too much. 1 lap extra is way overkill.  You lost at least a second if not 2 there. And it's easy to lose another 2 by not maximizing speed on entry.

He also did an extra lap on low fuel. That's another second."
I just timed it and apparently I screwed up there.. his pitstop (the refueling part) was 3 seconds faster but overall he was about 5 seconds faster. So yeah.. that's an area I need to train more..
"That could be, but until the pitstop he was constantly behind me, around 0.5-1.0 gap. After the pitstop his laptimes weren't faster than me. 

Maybe his driving technique requires less fuel though we were equally fast? Have to check out fuel saving strategies.. also not something I ever needed to worry about in the no-pitstop series :D"
"That's probably it, like rhilXD also suggested. 

So lessons learned:

\- Need to improve my pitentry timing  
\- Need to take less safety fuel  
\- Need to save fuel during the race  
\- Do pitstop at the last possible lap

Right, back to practicing this, thanks all :)"
No I didn't change tires :) I have that turned off in the ini file so it's off by default.
"I realize now that there is quite a lot to gain with both the pitstop itself and saving fuel while racing. In my case it was the difference between 3rd and 8th place ;) 

Thanks for the feedback."
"I don't think so.. he didn't gain on me and after the pitstops we both had no drivers in front of us and were practically doing the same laptimes. 

It's probably all the other fuel saving tips mentioned here :)"
"Yup.. I also need to practice when the last possible lap is to pit. The spotter now told me 'pit this lap' but maybe there was room for 1 more lap. 

But yes, despite it felt like I 'nailed' the pitstop - I lost a lot of time there."
"3 more seconds of refueling time equates to 7 - 8 liters, if that helps with your analysis. So most likely a combination of you overfueling and them saving, if I’d guess."
"If he was constantly behind you he will have been able to do 95% throttle and keep with you using the draft. It’s amazing how much fuel it saves. 

This sounds like he got the fuel saving done in the first stint and then was driving normal second stint. 

Fuel savings deffo worth look at, it isn’t always quicker. Worth mapping a clutch if your planning big lift and coasts. Or just do 95% when right up behind someone and then lifting early into corners. 

Good luck :)"

"He’s behind you in the draft, so saving fuel and likely lifting and coasting into braking zones. He also could be faster than you in general, and again, riding smoothly around coasting and fuel saving to undercut you.

All else equal, you didn’t fuck the pit entry or stop up…he got a lot of time on you in the refueling time because he needed less to finish than you."
"I always do the full lap of safety full, it would be worth experimenting to find out how much time you save by cutting back on that. There’s nothing worse than being short at the end of the race. Or you can do a cheeky bit of fuel saving to make up that difference. But not all tracks are faster with fuel saving, some it’s faster to push flat out all the way"
"FWIW, I take -0.2 laps of fuel when I race GT3... (or really anything with the iRacing auto fueler, it is very cautious)"
Wait you can do that by default? Got a link to the guide?
"It’s HUUGE in ovals. So much so that I practice pit stops more than racing sometimes. Getting down when exactly you need to brake to be exactly at pit speed as late as possible. Getting down the exact moment you need to brake to slide into your pit box. 

Something you can do is set a reset marker before pit entry and keep resetting after your pit stop completes. Just do it over and over til you have it engrained"
Look at their lap times too. You can see it in the results. Its likely not one single factor.
">Worth mapping a clutch if your planning big lift and coasts.

This doesn't work in GT3s anymore, afaik"
"It's the GT3 class and maybe it's me but the GT3's hardly seem to draft? Even on the long straight at Suzuka nobody seemed able to pass. The pitstop was the only exiting moment in that race :D

The GT3 doesn't have a clutch, at least not my Ferrari 296, but yeah, the combination of being in my slipstream and coasting was probably it. 

Going to experiment with the AI and measure how much fuel that saves me :)"
You're very likely right. Shame we can't see inputs from other players in the replay to analyze stuff like that. I'll put more focus on the whole fuel saving part.
"In app.ini, under Pit Service, set Autoresetpitbox to 0. Then tire change is off by default."
"Great idea, will do."
"That's what I did - I checked all his laptimes in the replay, then compared them with mine. After the pitstop there were 6 laps to go, we both were within tenths of each other. Some laps he was faster, some laps I was faster. 

That is why I posted here because I couldn't quite understand the huge gap he had after the pitstop."
"The draft might not be enough to overtake someone but it’s enough to lift the throttle a tiny bit and be saving fuel. It sounds like Suzuka will be a good one for you to practice and maximise the pit stop gains :) 

The GT3 doesn’t need a clutch to change gear but there’s nothing stoping you either using the clutch peddle or mapping a button on your wheel to put the clutch in at the end of a straight, it keeps your speed a little higher for longer when you stop accelerating rather than getting full engine breaking. 

Have fun practicing, fuel saving ect pays dividends when you start doing longer races"
Just did it. Thank you!
I'll have to double check that - I thought the clutch wasn't active at all in the GT3. Even looked downward under the wheel in Iracing (I use VR) to check if the car even had a clutchpedal :D
The clutch isn’t needed to change gear but you can still manually assign a clutch in the controls section which you can then use at the end of straights to lift and coast more efficiently as otherwise you get a lot of engine breaking.
They removed the clutching for lift and coast in GT3 last year I believe.
Good to know :) do you know if that’s the same for all the cars?? I was doing it for the GTP but if it doesn’t do anything will stop doing it and just do throttle lift
Still works in the GTPs apparently
Anything under 60 minutes is a sprint race.
Now you can race IMSA solo.
"Proto GT this week is 32 laps at Monza with pitstops. Its one of 2 ""endurance"" races this season. Races will be roughly 50 minutes instead of the standard 30 for most other weeks."
"you're missing the real options - it's not endurance if it's 60mins or less.  
  
120mins  
150mins  
180mins"
2.5-3 hours  if you are talking an endurance race.  60 minutes if youre talking something in a normal series on the weekly calendar
"I will be glad to see more 2h endurance races like on GT4, but with other cars."
24 hours is the right answer
"Yeah I know if you mean the endurance series but the gap between either doing a 45 minute race and 2 and half hour long race is huge. Not to mention those races are during the weekends when I'm focusing on the 79 so unfortunately I doesn't really work for me atm.

But I do think it's interesting that most people who've answered so far seem to agree that the regular IMSA series should at least have hour long races."
Well the endurance series kind of scratches that itch if you want to race for 2 hours or longer. There's just nothing in between of doing 45 minutes or well over two hours.
"ah. I see what you're getting at.  I think we got stuck on the word ""endurance"" (:"
Ferrari Challenge would like to have a word 
What’s your IR?
What split are you in?  I just had 3 0x races in the Buttkicker cup.
"Had the complete opposite experience with the GR. GT4 Fixed was mostly people driving a faster sports car for the first time and a total mess. The GT4/LMP3 Multiclass was better but the LMPs were sometimes maniacs. GT3/VRS Sprint has been good but people are generally very very aggressive, though mostly respectful (which I enjoy).

Long winded way to say I sometimes miss the close and pretty clean racing in the GR."
You cant judge a whole series when its a free car on a free track in one of the bottom splits
"I’ve raced this series for the last 12 months, it hasn’t really been my experience but I’ll pull out and just pressure if the driver in front is sketchy or let someone past if they are too aggressive.
 I usually get positive IR but definitely nowhere near top split, currently 1100 IR. I’m probably a little too conservative."
"I git from d to b in the gr86? Nice slow cars, easy to handle. I found the car and the racing much better than the mx 5."
This week has actually been one of the cleaner weeks in GR cup in my experience. Interlagos and red bull ring were disasters every race I was in.
"Please don't kill my hope, I just splurged on the Ferrari and the next week's track after getting my SR demolished from 3.0 to 2.1 on the GR86"
My money’s on a 3 digit number
"2nd split, but totally 👍🏻"
"I enjoyed the Ferrari challenge (before the 296 came in) with some what clean races.  For a complete shit show, try the Production Car Challenge.  4 different classes with 3 of them similar pace and no respect at all."
"""Demolished"" from 3.0 to 2.1? Thats nothing bro. I will say that charlotte roval has not yielded me a clean race, so I bailed on it for the rest of the week."
"1900, easy money"
The Ferrari Challenge was my main focus before the 296. I don't like it nearly as much anymore.
I agree the production car challenge is way worse
"My experience couldn't be any more different, I've ran 5 races so far this week, one I stupidly took myself out on green and then later the same race my game crashed, I still ended only x4 and gained SR, the other 4 I had 2 wins and 2 Silver's with 1x between them, gained a fair bit of both ir and Sr, granted I qualified pole or second on all but one race and missed the shenanigans, one I forgot to qualify and had to make my way through the field, in the end P1 was too far ahead."
That’s like right on the edge of clean races and dirty races
"I had 3 excellent races in the weekly series when it was gr/okyama only to be followed the next day by 3 wreckfests, the only difference was time of day, and percentage of drivers from a certain part of the world, who drive very blocky/divebomby."
I also tried to get this to work for Overlays in VR but it never worked for me either. The Problem still exists for me even though Im on a Quest 3 now. Really would like to get a fix for it. Im using a Link Cable.
Holy arca brake
These cars lock up hard when you touch the brake. Next time when you lock up let off the brake a bit so the wheel can grip up. You had this wreck avoided just couldn't steer out of it because you were sitting on the brakes.
"How did you finish? After practicing at Talladega last night, it seems the 1987 cars have more grip there this week in the Winter Series. I'm hoping to join tonight's race."
Yea holy shit

“You’ve got wheel damage”
"Around 1/4th  of the field died, but I somehow got out with no inc points and no damage.  I ended up using all my luck for ovals this week."
when you find out your goat washed 💔💔💔
Bros got a reaction time of a 90 year old
I raced the fixed race in top split last night and finished 12th out of 29th and I started 29th. To me it’s all about lifting into the corners and trying to save as much as possible considering amount of tires you get.
"8th after I hit the wall hard later on in the race.   47s required repairs put me 2 laps down. 

Might have been a top 5 finish without that, but oh well."
I'm beginning to hear this in my sleep!
"Do you get 2 extra sets for 94 laps? If so, are you only pitting twice for tires? Are two stops enough fuel to last to the end?"
"Not bad despite hitting the wall. Btw, the engine sound on the 1987's are great, compared to the Next Gen cars that sound like a sewing machine."
You get like 4 additional sets of tire. Two stops for fuel would be extremely stretching it. You also have to remember that you can get up to 3 GWC. If it’s a caution fest I tend to pit for fuel every opportunity I can get and only take tires after 20 laps of green. It’s hard to really play as things can change in an instant. I was watching top split open last night and people were pitting with 5 laps left in the race because they couldn’t make it for Duke and some were trying to stretch it the rest of the way
"I took an extra set of right tires on accident[after like 1 or 2 laps] so that sucked.

bottom split was a caution fest[and always will be till the field shrinks enough] with like 10 cautions[1/3th of the race was under yellow]."
It’s a crap shoot. We had a decent stint with green flag pit stops and then it turned into a caution fest. Got screwed because a car spun out and messed up a bunch of people
So all of y'all have been using some sort of haptic reactor or bass shaker this whole time and I've been over here braking blindly?!?
I am not sure if it is exactly the ABS I am hearing but turning tyres up in the volume sliders can make you easily here is you are braking too hard and overheating the tyres. I don't see if ABS is engaging and use the sound to feel the brakes.
[Sim magic has exactly what you are looking for.](https://simshop.com/products/simagic-p1000-p-hpr-haptic-pedals-reactor?variant=47206117310784&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgLjLyJT5gwMVlyCtBh1SwwiMEAQYAiABEgITpfD_BwE)
"Buttkicker would work, or there are tons of methods for DIYing haptics onto your pedals, especially if you have access to a 3d printer"
Homemade vibration for $70.  Works a treat.
Haptic reactors/ bass shakers.
I use an old phone as a Simhub dash. It lights up whenever TC/ABS triggers. It's not as fancy as haptic feedback but it's free and it works.
I have the grid brows by simlab and they work very good for abs lights for $99
There are some software overlays that will indicate it I believe.
Grid Brows
I have a ddu that is running lovely dash. The lights on the left and right of the screen blink yellow when I'm locking up the brakes. I also get feedback though my fanatec pedals
I use grid brows to let me know ABS is activated
If you use iOverlays their inputs overlay has an option to flash red when abs is being triggered
Simagic has a haptic motor that I’ve heard are very good. Otherwise these are also very good and much cheaper. https://dcsimracing.com/gb/accessories/12-prueba.html
"you can hear the tires overworking, you can feel the wheel shaking, you can visualize the car understating. it’s not hard"
I'm pretty sure my V3's shake.
"I'm definitely going to get the Simagic Haptic motor for my brake pedal when I have the budget because it will be most like how my brake pedal responds to ABS in my road car when on track or at autocross. In the meantime, you all inspired me to look into overlays and I couldn't find one that wasn't distracting with pedal inputs and was just a flashing indicator. I found out that you can create custom dashboards in Simhub and did a test ABS light that is working great in iRacing! I'm just going to clean up the look and start using it until I can get the pedal mod. If anyone is interested, I can try to share the files. It'll basically just be 4 pink LED lights that flash when ABS is triggered (inspired by the 911 ABS lights) that you can drag the transparent overlay anywhere on your screen. I'll test one strip of lights and if that isn't apparent enough, I may try to create dual fake eyebrow type lights to ""add"" to any car's dash. Thanks for all the suggestions!"
"There’s also free options such as overlays that will light up when abs triggers. IOverlay has one, and racelabs might as well but could be a paid feature."
"The simagic shaker has only been out for a few months to be fair 

I also have the LED on my wheel setup to flash blue when abs fires"
The simagic shaker has only been out for a few months to be fair
Best upgrade I’ve made to my rig.
"I have my tires turned up and other noises turned down to hear the tires scrubbing when turning, but I'm not sure if I've listened for ABS. Is it sort of a pulsing locking up sound or something else you listen out for?"
"Can confirm. Hooked up my haptics to p1000 pedals last night, immediately fell in love."
"Shit this looks awesome, might have to pick that up"
"I don't think this would indicate ABS as Iracing doesn't share that data. What you would get is wheel slip, which is nice and all but not quite the same thing. ABS can engage without wheel slip/locking."
"But do they just shake your pedal when you use it, or does it somehow know to shake say only at abs engagement"
![gif](giphy|eovguhftazsCQ|downsized)
Only ABS would be displayed in your dash. I make simhub dashes and afaik iRacing doesn't output \[TC\_active\].
Not available in US... 😔 You all have all the cool stuff over there...
Definitely will look into this for the time being since the budget is tight. 😣
You can make a genric indicator box on racelabs to put a widget in.  I use it for ABS myself.  I think it's a paid feature though.
I thing in the gt3 cars if you go 100% brake in to hard braking zones you hear a quite loud screech which I'm guessing are mixro lock ups saved by abs
"Just picked up some p2000s yesterday after using crappy pedals for my entire life (been around since NASCAR Racing, GPL, NR2003). Holy moly. Already I'm addicted to making this even better, and your comment is honestly all I needed to hear. "
Umm I use the SimuCube Active Pedal as a brake pedal and it 100% gets ABS data from iRacing. You might be mixing it up with TC data which iRacing does not send out meta data for. 
"ABS 100% works on iracing, I’ve been using that simagic motor for a few months now exclusively with iracing. I also have the lights on my simagic wheel set to flash blue when abs fires"
That's what I was wondering if you could configure this with the ABS in iRacing as I haven't found any articles about that. It definitely looks nice!
ABS telemetry was added back in 2021. They still don’t have traction control telemetry though.
You can edit it in sim hub
"I can confirm this, ABS 100% works properly in iRacing. Using the haptic pedal reactor on my brake. TC has also worked for me on the GR86 and Porsche Cayman GT4, although it doesn't trip super frequently compared to ABS."
I was told it won't send data to my fanatec pedals shakers for abs
"That's interesting because it does not send ABS information to my shakers, only wheel slip. It's easy to tell when the ABS lights are flashing, yet no vibration - only getting vibration when allowing more slip/lock on the ABS."
It works 100%
"Simhub with haptic pedal attachments, or even transducers will do that in iRacing no problem.

You can add so many different things it’s pretty amazing.

I’ve got haptic motors on my Ultimate pedals and 6  transducer all bed my rig with different details going to each - super immersive! And really helps feel when ABS or TC is active."
I don't think iRacing sends out TC data. I'm willing to bet whatever pedal software you are using is guesstimating when TC is being engaged in-sim.
It might just be a SimuCube Active Pedal software thing though given how open iRacing is to hardware manufactures I find it hard to believe they would open it up to SimuCube and Simagic (with their pedal transducer things) and not Fanatec. Maybe Fanatec hasn't requested access to that realtime data? Not sure if it would matter though because from what I remember with my Fanatec V3 pedals the motor on the back of the pedals was extremely weak. You need some extreme motion to really feel it.
"Maybe it is a SimuCube Active Pedal thing only but it very clearly, the moment ABS is engaged in-sim, sends a signal to the Active Pedal software to trigger the brake pedal to start moving against your foot and it seems to disengage it the same moment it stops in-sim."

Nice work
I never understood it but im hooked on dirt oval. Might need to tune in to irl events to watch now
Honestly it was really fun. I’m still very slow though. I’m a 2.8k road but have no pace on Ovals yet
The only thing missing was jumping on another car!
"No one ever does..maybe its the magic word.

Looks like Draft Masters. They're using the Craftsman Trucks this week.
"It’s pickup cup, you’re not supposed to brake or lift"
I did brake a little. Was afraid of being slammed from the back as well
Thanks. Still a ton of luck there
I would say it’s 80% luck 10% panic maneuvers and 10% skill to save myself from spinning. I have triples but definitely don’t see cars flying around from all directions. I was trying to respond to what’s ahead and got lucky with the rest not taking me out.
"At Daytona (where this is) and Talladega, at those tracks you can stay on the throttle the entire time, because the steep banking and the shallow corner angles make it so that you're never grip-limited. The difficulty comes from knowing when to push forward, how to manage traffic, how to draft to your advantage, etc. Being successful is all about strategy, except for when you're trying to avoid wrecks.

This form of racing came about after the famous 1987 Nascar crash at Talladega, where they implemented the ""restrictor plate"" to limit power for all future superspeedway races.

If you take a slower car to a mid-sized oval it might be the same situation, so you get ""plate races"" in those environments as well, like Street Stocks at Charlotte.

With fast cars at every other oval though, you are grip-limited in the corners, and you need to manage your tire wear to make sure you don't immediately lose pace after one or two laps of being able to keep up with the leaders.

If you race any high-downforce cars I think there's a ton you can learn specifically from running Indycar oval races, because that will teach you a ton about how dirty air affects your car's handling. If you know what happens to your car as you go through someone's aero wash at Texas or Las Vegas, you'll have a better understanding of what to expect when it happens at Watkins Glen or Road America."
To me. Yes. Very and it’s very hard to understand where to find time
"Hop on rookie street stocks and give it a try! I am in the camp of people who thought ""turning left is easy and boring"". I tried one race, got hooked, and now I love it. Oval racing is incredibly tactical across all levels, but the other commenter summarized it well that tire wear management is so key and requires a really good understanding of how tire loads work, how to select a line, and how the track evolves as it gets rubbered in."
"Thanks for the tip. My PC is decent. It’s a 13700k, 3080 and 32DDR5, I’ll have to try that and see if it affects FPS"

"small communities usually organize a specific time slot where everyone gets together to race. Almost like a public league.

I think the mustang series last I checked gets a solid race on the first one of the week, so 7pm est Mondays"
"The Mustang Challenge is an odd one because it's a new series for a fairly old car. There's been some suspicion that it's related to an upcoming release of some new Mustangs in iRacing, specifically a Dark Horse variant that would replace the FR500S. But that's all been just rumors.

Basically, there's little reason for them to not offer it just to have more variety. It's not taking much server load with the maybe 2 splits it gets on a popular week. And it's not really taking people away from other series because it's not popular."
American Muscle Car is one such league... watched it on Matt Malone's twitch channel last night... I think there were 50 mustangs racing at VIR... really good racing.
The only problem with the FR500S in iRacing is that if you don’t have a clutch pedal you will be left in the dust on a straightaway. Hopefully bringing in the Dark Horse R it’ll be a little more forgiving.
"It’s not just the mustang that suffers, the Ligier is occasionally like that but I think a big factor is the track of the week also."
I wish people still ran the Dallara 05 it's fun to drive. Doing some old indy races!!!
This is well into tinfoil hat territory and do not take this seriously but there’s some theorising that the Mustang GT3 will get a one make series like the Ferrari does and the series is there so there’s a community vote when it hits

"Malone said on his stream that iracing was in Daytona this week scanning the mustang and vette. This is all still word of mouth tho...


Got lost in my mustang posts... gt3 has nothing to do with the old fr500s probably lol, ignore me"
"That makes sense I guess. I just wish that if they knew it’ll be so unpopular, they could lower the minimum driver count. I like to race in it when I see a couple other people but it’s a waste of time irating and sr wise"
"Yeah and none of those guys ever participate in official sessions. So despite there being a series for it, it remains totally dead in official public sessions. I cannot understand everyone's obsession with the MX-5 and the GR-86 when there are other options like the FR500S also available.

People have no interest in H-Shifting anymore. I think every H-Pattern Road Car on iRacing is basically a dead series. If it ain't flappy paddle shifting with forgiving down shifting then people won't participate. Seems like people hate cars that require a bit more skill and input to maximize."
I'll have to check this out
I watched his Mustang race at Montreal on youtube… so exciting
It having a clutch pedal is what makes it so fun :(
"I use a wheel button (bottom left on my G27) and it’s treated me well. It’s a little unrealistic, but oh well."
"I have never know this to be true. If you're getting left in the dust on the straights it is more likely because you're shifting way too late.


You don't want to rev it out like most cars. You should be shifting at either the last yellow light or the first red light."
"You can use the iracingreports.com [discord bot](https://discordbot.iracingreports.com//discord) to check when the populated splits are.

There is also simracingstats.com but it's currently not working and it's not clear of it's coming back.

I think it's nice they keep these series active for people who have the car and continue to enjoy driving it."
"Also, look in the forums, series like this, sometimes list when these raves occur.  Some call it an SOF race."
What prize is this? I have seen nothing about prizes for the Skip Barber Challenge series. Can you please post a link or some information on what this prize for those series is? I enjoy both of those series but it's really hard to find splits in my time zone.
"Does that prize still exist? I saw that it did initially from YouTube but wasn’t sure if it was first time only

I’m not nearly good enough but that would be so fricken cool"
I’m pretty sure I’ve heard these rumors since I got on the service three years ago
"Yeah, a couple people from Daytona have reported that(or seen people with iRacing logo'd clothing in the garages) they scanned the IMSA GT3 (and maybe GT4) cars, but the current Mustang in iRacing isn't a full racing spec car like those, so something like the Dark Horse is a more similar replacement, and we don't have any information on if they scanned that version already or not."
If my memory serves me correctly if a race doesn’t go official you still gain/lose SR. The only thing you don’t gain/lose is IR. Plus race craft is race craft so even running unofficials can sometimes be valuable for experience.
"As long as mustang is in PCC we happy. H shift, no downforce, no assists and a decent steering lock. It's a delight to slide."
I'd love an H pattern but there's no way to add it to my rig comfortably. I imagine this applies for a lot of people
"That’s totally fine, I get it. But being left in the dust on a straight like you’re in a different class of car entirely stinks, which hurts participation."
"It’s very true, in fact you can ask Matt Malone about it on his stream and he’ll tell you exactly why a clutch and a shifter is faster than auto clutch. Don’t take my word for it, the subject matter expert himself will tell you the exact same thing."
[iracingstats.net](https://iracingstats.net) is a good replacement that has popped up since
"https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/52540/season-1-2024-contests

You're probably too late now as it requires 10 weeks of participation but this has been the prize for the 2/3 seasons the series has existed. "
Yeah it was offered again for this season.
"The current Mustang in iRacing is the FR500S. It’s a full spec racing car. It’s the FR500C that raced in Grand Am without the really expensive 5.0 Cammer engine. 

The street car uses the TR3650 5 speed. The FR500S is the TR6060 6 speed. 

https://performanceparts.ford.com/fr500-race-cars/"
"You do gain SR, but at the same level you do in practice, which is basically nothing. "
Correct
"Idk, I checked the results screen and it had no change on my safety rating. 

I don’t know exactly what it was before the race so maybe that’s just bugged in results tho"
"While I'm very happy that the Mustang is in PCC, (and I want it to stay there) the participation for it there is terrible too. I'm pretty sure that's part of the reason they brought it back as a solo series - They were hopeful that in a Cup style series people might have more interest. And honestly, I thought it would have more interest than this too.

We see people doing it in Community Races and having a great time. We see people watching the streams and YouTube videos from those Community Cup Races and enjoying the content. Yet any actual official race featuring the FR500S is completely empty. I live in EST and finding a split in either it's own series or the PCC is almost impossible. There is a couple splits for it over an entire week counting both series.

God forbid I happen to be busy at that moment, I don't get to race the car that week or maybe the next. And then when it's not something I can consistently plan on, I am not going to waste my time practicing for it when I could be running other cars I know will get official sessions.

I really can't understand how the car has such a strong appreciation among the community inside and out and yet is deader than dead in all official series it's involved in."
You can map to a wheel button.
Usually I miss a few gears during a race so it probably evens out 😂
"I mean, I'm one of the top Mustang drivers myself, have been racing it for 12 years. Matt and I have raced many times, and he has often said that he considers me faster than himself (though I think he's being modest -- he's usually a pretty even match for me).

That said... being a well-qualified expert doesn't mean I'm right. I don't go testing autoclutch on a regular basis, so I could certainly be remembering wrong. I'll test when I get home."
"Well, I stand corrected. I did just do a controlled test, and autoclutch is in fact about .15 slower accelerating from 2nd gear to the top of 5th. It is UGLY how it engages.

Not quite ""multiclass"", but a pretty noticeable disadvantage. Probably close to half a second per lap depending on how many long straights there are.

Also, nobody asked, but you can lose as little as 0.5 seconds on that same test even shifting without using clutch at all."
"Cool, I didn't know about that one.  It doesn't look like there is an easy way to quickly figure out in which timeslots are going official for these niche series, though.  With the discord bot I linked you can have it generate a table that will show you how many racers are participating in each time slot so you can pretty easily see when the official races happen."
"Thank you so much for this! Yeah, definitely too late for this season but maybe they will do it again next season. I didn't even know such a thing existed."
Yeah ui doesn't show it correctly. There is still a change but the ui doesn't show the change
"I've read it shows on the website results, just not in the client UI. I think it also only grants SR at .35 of the normal value, like a practise session."
"Unfortunately nobody looks outside the boring gt3/gt4 echo chamber. I bet if you polled how many people even have 3 pedals the result would be surprisingly low.  
Totally agree the car deserves more or we need more like it but that's just not what the main user wants.. they demand this years, revised but the same, numb gt3."
"Always always always check the forum for contests, if it wasn't for my last minute check I'd be a week short from hopefully winning that day pass to Skip Barber."
Cool. The two other guys who got like 14 incident points in a 3 car race are going to be quite upset lol
"You just missed week 1 but RCI has an imsa league: https://racerci.com/championships/219/calendar

Ohh no worries! Thank you mate really appreciated  - will look now thanks
"Doesn't matter to me. I race fixed/open based on race start times.  Length is irrelevant. 

Many of the series however have fixed/open back to back which makes running ""the double"" quite nice.  3 hours and you can practice and run 2 races which is great. "
"Absolutely, I love longer races where strategy matters someway, in short fixed races you need only to push"
Aren’t fixed series more often than not more popular to begin with?
Depends on the setup and car/track combo
Depends on the series & track. Anything at Daytona for example feels better in the fixed to me as it has to have more wing
"I’ve found that the fixed races generally have very poor driving standards.  Maybe that’s because they’re shorter, but it’s given me a bad taste for them in general.

Plus I like to be able to tune a setup for my driving style.  I can’t make a baseline setup fast,  but I can tune a fast setup to my liking."
"Doesn't matter to me - like at all. I'll race it all.

Certain cars and series do have absolutely abysmal fixed setups that are just brutal to drive sometimes though, but usually I'll do one of those, realize the setup in particular is ass and if it bugs me enough or I just can't seem to figure out a work around with my driving then I'll just drive something else for the week.

Thats pretty rare though. I race the fixed stuff a lot in ovals. With road course I do it all all the time. Ovals I don't bounce between the two too much but that just comes down to time."
I don’t like fixed races because sometimes it takes one click of a setting to make the car much more enjoyable to drive.
"No, as a road racer I just don't like how understeery the fixed usually setup is. And the concept of fixed setup races overall is something I don't like."
"Yeah I'm quite the same, it's a shame the fixed races I race, they barely even get half the field size or amount of splits as open series."
"Definitely not on dirt oval, and a few oval tracks I've raced are much more common with the open series. I wish it was more popular because I much rather race on an even playing field because then you can work on your driving ability because that's just what it comes down to."
That's fair enough
What about the concept of the races would be different if it had the same rules and settings as open?
"Being forced to race a setup I don't like under the guise of equality even though whether fixed or open it's the same hierarchy.

Talking road only, of course. Oval is a different beast and setups are ridiculously important."
"That's fair. I personally enjoy fixed just because even if the setup is ass, if the person winning is pushing epic lap times and pulling away from you, then it means it's your driving ability that's lacking, and not the tune. You can improve your driving style significantly by racing fixed because that's all it comes down to, then, when you're consistently making good pace, once you want to try open races, you can perfect your car to your driving preference, knowing exactly where the fastest line in the track is."
Yeah I like that the fixed series are more of a level playing field & it allows me to compare myself more directly to my competition
This is for you guys in the future googling this just click reset FFB in iRacing.
Where are those settings? I've only ever seen his for DD1.
"thats only one fix though.  
 To get rid of wheel oscilations is to find a balance between FFB strenght and dampening and filtering. And tweak that untill the wheel doesnt oscilate anymore when driving at a fairly high constant speed.   
ofc altering the amount of FFB strenght will also have a impact on how much dampening is needed, so does the weight of your rim for example.  


this can lead you 2 paths really, make a profile for each car, or try to find a middle ground that works on most cars"
I was sitting still in the pits when this would happen.
"What he says is still relevant to this issue regardless if you're moving or sitting still. Its a FFB strength, gain, dampening, filtering issue.

I have a baseline setup across the board for my fanalabs setting that works with most cars and sims and then adjust per car in iRacing"
"You should probably take this up with your ISP. But as a quick and simple first solution, manually set your DNS server for your Ethernet connection and use a fast free DNS server like Google or Cloudflare (do a bit of research, lots of options). 

Often services struggling to connect but internet otherwise working is down to ISP’s DNS servers being less than excellent or in some cases, even misrouting or blocking traffic erroneously. 

I’m not familiar with FiOS but you may even be able to set the DNS server in the router itself. Or you can put a second router behind the ISP’s router. In doing so, all devices on the network will use that DNS."
Have you tried using WI-FI to see if iRacing connects? I'm assuming this is a modem/router combo from Verizon. I'm guessing you rebooted the PC and router. I actually use my own router & modem (TP-LINK WiFi 6 Gaming Router) instead of getting nickel and dime'd each month from Spectrum. I only use WI-FI because it's extremely fast and reliable in my home.
Free DNS Benchmark program: [https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm](https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm)
Thanks for all of the suggestions. I wound up buying an additional router and linked it to my Fios router which fixed the issues as was mentioned.
Same here

Boom

I will never race race dirt road again"
"And this is why I don't care about my ratings anymore - just go and race like you would like to be raced.  (Granted, it took 9 years to achieve this Zen.)"
"Jealous?

I’d say average champ points would better prove who’s the best. Consistently placing good in top splits is much harder than having a good win percentage in low splits.
I have 14 years of sub .. that get me any clout ?
Shouldn’t this go off of irating?
Does win percentage really matter in iRacing? I'm actually curious because I always assumed it didn't really matter because there may be some pretty bad drivers that have good win rates due to being in low splits constantly. I kind of thought only iRating mattered but now I'm curious is people actually care about win rates.
All depends on what you race. If I ran nothing but Mustang I'd have about 80-90%. If I ran GT3 it would be like 1%.
"Road , 443 starts , 62 wins, irating peak 3817

Must be Ricky Bobby. All you do is win or crash trying.
Points per race is a good metric
I say start the irating screenshot chain under this comment
It doesn't. If you're winning it just means you're in too low of a split.
None of it actually matters it’s all subjective. You can have a high irating and never win or have a irating that gives you a competitive chance to win. Whatever floats your boat. I personally want to see how high I can get my irating
Points per race balanced against win rate can show if you're seal clubbing.
Yeah that’s a really good irating
Can you read? What does the first sentence say?
How do you get club points?

"You'll get there man, it's a rough transition coming from other sims. Here a lot of practice goes into the circuits before anyone enters a race, so it's normal to feel behind the curve to begin with imo"

If you’re on a single screen look left and look right are super important to have easily accessible. 
"The extra paddles are for dual stage clutches, very useful for open wheel and TCR standing starts.

Encoders could be used for ABS, TC, Brake Bias(both regular and fine adjustments), various mapping options like fuel or throttle maps, etc. Some cars are just absolutely not going to need all of them and that's okay."
"For the 7 directional switches (funky buttons)

I use one for voice chat control:

* Up: mute driver
* Down: mute all drivers
* Left/right : change channel 
* Rotate: volume
* I don't use press because sometimes I accidentally press it when using the switch.

The other I use to navigate/edit the black box.

* Up/down/left/right: move through options
* Press: select
* Rotate: change values

I use separate buttons to page through the black box pages

I haven't found a use for the absolute value encoders.

I also have buttons assigned to.

* iRacing push to talk
* Discord push to talk
* Set Active reset start point
* Active reset
* Pit speed limiter
* Visor tare off, for open wheel
* DRS/Push to pass, depending on car

I have no idea what you’re even referring to.
"I'm probably blind, but what issue?"
"I believe I have put on my detective hat for the day:

OP is mad because someone parked on the racing line PRIOR to the pace car pulling off. He never 'left the grid' and just parked up and left his car in the way, either because of an issue or because of being an asshole. 

Protest, get the account banned, move on. No reason to spend time on code when this makes it nice and easy to remove accounts and ban machines!"
"Sorry it’s not clear, what issue?"
Bad drivers? Can’t fix that with programming
"![gif](giphy|J2IJOuSBPjXjaxDkrQ|downsized)

you cant fix stupid

the only way you could ""fix"" that is ghosting cars till green which leads to its own issues if the leader goes after the pace car is in and before green"
Spun driver waits for the pack to pass before moving and you're mad because other drivers don't have wreck avoidance?
🤔
"Is iracing this bad? My last race was 13 years ago, and stuff like this was unheard of."
"I don't think iracing wants to be like GT sport. The old saying it's a sim not a game here is very applicable here. 

Iracing wants to be more true to life and sometimes that means getting unlucky. It is a game at the end of the day so trying to balance it out between enjoyment and realism has odd choices"
Devs can't just magically program brains into people's head to not drive into the stationary vehicle.
"Clarification: A driver started the race: but never left the grid. If you don't pace for the whole warmup lap iRacing should boot or ghost your car so we don't end up barrelling into your parked grid car blocking the track. 

That is all."
What are you even talking about? You okay buddy?
?
"That’s right, you are no developer"
"It’s a feature, not a bug. This is an intended affect. You could programme the car to phase in certain situations if you want."
Your car actually spawns like that at Charlotte (no I have no clue why) but it would make sense if the driver clicked grid and went completely afk
This is what I was referring to! Why can't they ghost grid afk cars that never start the race instead of leaving them there for the entire field to crash into after the warmup lap?
Very realistic to start a race with a car parked sideways in the track lol
"It’s rare that someone trolls like this, the protest system will sort him out. No offence intended but we dont want ghosting, go play forza or gt sport if that’s what you like"
Yes I dont understand why they would allow a car to not move the entire warmup lap and block the entire track! Ghost or boot if you don't move after half the warmup lap is completed.
"i thought that they just spun and sat there holding their brakes to let the field pass safely.  i didnt see enough replay to know they sat there for a lap, which kind of seems weird cause i thought pace laps there werent an entire lap at that track and layout.  if they really did sit there sideways for an entire lap just to wreck the field right before green then send in a protest.   that would be upheld without a doubt.   i thought you were talking about all the idiots that cant see past their nose when there is a stopped car on the track a quarter mile ahead"
Yes I think most irl races let drivers park their car on the grid and get out and leave them where they started! Hah
It's not hard to find amateur and professional races that have chaotic starts/restarts 2020 mugello f1 restart is great example
You should have at the very least gotten a confirmation email shortly after sending it.
"You should get 2 emails. One when the protest is submitted and then another one when it's resolved (""member was notified"" = successful)"

It can take a couple days but this is the email you get if the protest was successful. They also send one when you submit it. Make sure you include everything required."

If you go go the traxionGG channel, the videos that used to tag daves channel, now tag @ripple.corpor._ which is some kind of crypto scam/spam page. 

Literally raced against him earlier today, so it's happened super recently I guess :/."
Love Dave Cam. I learned (and am STILL learning) how to race by watching his videos. I hope he can recover his content. That’s years of work he’s put in.

Is there anything we can do to help?
"That just sucks major arse!!! I hope Dave can get up and running again. Just like Matt Malone, he’s my daily go to for sim racing content. It’s how I got into the excellent PROTO/GT series!"
Same here.  I went there and it was some Ripple nonsense. I hope his work can be recovered.  Love watching his races.
"I just looked and his channel is gone from
My subscription page must have been suspended for something I was watching his race against Malone the other day"
I just watched his videos a few hours ago that’s crazy.
Good god that’s honestly utterly fucking disgusting someone would do that to another person.
"I hope he gets it sorted, Dave seems like a top bloke and his content is always honest and relatable.

I had a chat with him on a livestream before Christmas and I found out he grew up and worked in my neck of the woods. I knew I found that accent relatable for some reason. Nice guy."
Who the fuck would do this to Dave. Or to anyone. Fucking children with nothing better to do.
Yeah it's hacked by some crypto junk it appears
Hope he gets everything back.   Dave’s vids are my go to comfort Iracing videos
I thought it was just me lol.  Went looking for his channel earlier today and saw the Tesla stuff.

Should be back to normal in some time hopefully"
"Ugh that sucks.  I didn't know who it was that got hacked, but I knew something was up when I saw a notification about a ""Tesla earnings call"" or something to that effect.  Saw something similar happen to a music channel I subscribe to last year.  Thankfully they got it back after a few days.  Hope it's the same here."
This happens to even huge YouTube accounts. Linus Tech Tips was hacked last year and scam crypto stuff was spammed non stop until control was back.
Yea he just posted a new video about it. Got hacked from some place posing as a VPN sponsor
"To make up for the drop in viewers the past day, we should all watch 3 of his videos a day for the next few days."
He's regained control of his channel.
sadge. remember to always enable 2FA in accounts of stuff you really care about.
Bro that’s insane. I have no words. Not just my fav sim driver to watch but one of my favorite channels wow
"Youtube has everything backed up. He will 100% get it back within a week. As long as you generate enough income for youtube, they actually help you very fast."
"he will, iv seen at least 10 channels iv subscribed to get hacked over the past year or so. All eventually came back from big (LTT) to very small.  
They just seem to take a long time for something that seems clear cut..."
"I got a notification today about a “Tesla earnings call” on YouTube. Something I follow. Generally, that means someone got hacked. I wasn’t sure who it was but.. I guess this was it."
Same here. His channel position in my subscription list is now “Ripple”. I hope whoever is responsible gets nailed.
Did daves channel become traxiongg? I've been out of the loop awhile there.
"His ""how to rejoin safely"" video was very helpful as a rookie. He seems like a lovely chill guy and watching him race is a great way to learn."
2FA won´t help you when they get their hands on your browser sessions like they did with LinusTechTips
"It doesn’t matter in certain instances, they get the token"
And NEVER use SMS 2FA.
Yeah its crazy he was even targeted as sim racing is niche but i suppose 80 000 subs is huge
"He'll get it back, don't worry. YouTube, for all its faults, has a very good track record when it comes to restoring channels."
Good to know
Yeah nothing too big to worry about
YES I was wondering why I was suddenly subscribed to Ripple but only just now put it together!
"I'm not sure tbh, although it looks like he's managed to get back control of the davecam channel now/restored his content, just hasn't been able to change the name back yet"
From where..?
Yes but anyways it's an extra security layer. You avoid the dumb hackers/bots at least (they are the most common).
"Yep, sorry, forgot to mention that"
"These aren’t generally particularly targeted. It tends to be pretty automated. They just send out links and crap and try to get people to click on it, then replace the content with crypto scams."
Same here. Wtf is ripple?
There is a great podcast about cycber security. This episode covers spoofing a phone for 2FA https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/87/
Cryptocurrency :(
"I know a guy who had his bank account drained even with 2FA. It's not the be all end all people think it is.

He thinks they'd been watching his account for a while too because he said he normally keeps a couple thousand dollars in there. But he deposited a rather large check from a client and before he could shuffle the funds around to other accounts and pay bills, his account was empty. You can see it on his bank statement - single large transfer to a burner account in the Philippines for $25,000 3 and a half hours after deposit."
Just don’t use sms 2fa. Literally every recommendation for the last couple years has been use an app or push system.
did you mean to reply to me?
Are you using ini edit or NVIDIA Surround? Did you recently update the GPU drivers?
"hit alt+enter and move the title bar a bit, it will pop back out into 3 monitor mode."
"I discovered a software called resize raccoon and it changed my life. Offers the exact same thing as NVIDIA but allows your monitors to stay separate. If that makes sense. I swap between desktop to rig on the same pc, so having to setup NVIDIA every time gets really annoying. Pairing resize raccoon with iRacing manager fixes the screens automatically when I load into the sim."
I have nvidia surround. I haven’t updated the drivers. The triples work fine outside of the race screen. The load in is 3 screens. Then it goes to one once in race.
I got it guys. Thanks for the help
Even better to just set up triples with the ini files no need for other software.
Try redoing the iRacing graphics setup on the home screen. Btw NVIDIA just had an update a few days ago. Maybe you need to take the update and then reconfigure your setup in the NVIDIA screen again. It seems the same thing happened to me back in November and I think I fixed it by updating the NVIDIA driver and setting up triples again in the NVIDIA and Windows graphics setting.
"I tried surround once and was a pain. Kept switching screens around.
Never had an issue with just changing settings in ini."
Check out Dan Suzuki's recent video on how to set up triples. Dump nvidia surround.
Ig I didn’t think of that.. 😂
"I've only had one issue with Surround and it was after an NVIDIA driver update. All I had to do was go back into the NVIDIA settings and set up the three monitors again. When I first hooked up triples, I used the ini edit method and after an iRacing update, I had to reconfigure it again.


Once I figured out the Surround method, there was no way I was going back to the ini edit method. I get a few more FPS with Surround and HDR does make iRacing's graphics almost lifelike. Btw, Surround has improved since the first time I tried it last year. It's less buggy now, at least during my experience."

"My clock smash was a misbehaving USB device.  Check your device manager and make sure no devices have warnings.  Change power management options so that USB devices won't turn off.

If that isn't it, contact support for more ideas."
I saw that but it doesn’t seem to be caused by the same thing. I have reduced PC workload to the absolute maximum you can. No solution and it’s so intermittent that I can’t seem to find a cause.
"I contacted support and we are working through it. So far it seems better but not fixed. At the moment I shut off all… and I mean ALL background programs the only software I have running is IRacing itself, simucube, and crewchief. Definitely still having a few issues but app didn’t close out 🤞"
nice. to finish first first you must finish. so many people seem to forget this and try and win the race in the first turn.
"I don’t think that was me but I had a similar incident earlier this week. GWC, white flag flies and I lost it going into T1 sitting in 3rd. Heartbreaking. 

Good on you for getting through it 💪"
"Sometimes your position is determined by how you've driven all race, and sometimes it's determined by the one wreck nobody else was able to avoid. It's not always fair, so just remember these fortunate events when you're on the losing end... and congrats on the position gains!!"
"5K is an achievement. Well done.

Just interested what you upgraded to and where it helped you improve. What Irating  were you when you got the new wheel."
Also where’s that calculator?
"Congrats! Recently made it to 2.2k, the line of top 10 percentile. I think my gf was the opposite of impressed lol you’re right that no one outside of this community could care less."
Honest question : how are you only C 2.64 while 5000+ iRating ?
Congrats on the 5k mate. It's an awesome achievement! 🤙
"I made it to 4978 last year but have lost about -400 iR since then, but still not giving up on 5k!"
"Thats huge.  
Congratulations sir! :)"
The bell curve is insane in this game! Congratulation!
"Congrats! I know what a grind this can be. I am in the same spot, now 70 points shy of 5k. I had 4k as a goal but I started to get mad when a crash happened so I stopped hunting for 4k. Now, only a couple weeks have passed and it’s about to be 5k. I wish you best of luck and the mental calm to not care once it eventually drops again."
"Now prepare to get rekt in any other race other than Mazda. And you won't start as many races because fear of losing iRating. Sorry if I sound rude, but 'farming iR' in rookies is not very smart.

I suggest don't have an iRating goal, have a racing goal instead."
"Hell yeah, that’s really an achievement."
"Heck yeah dude! Congratulations!!! 🎉That’s the dream, but I have two kids and no time to grind it out. Just proud of my 3K recently!

You said you use VRS. What percentage are you usually off of the coaches time each week? I usually aim for .5 a 1% off and that’s usually good for a top 10 in a lot of series."
"Cheers man :). I upgraded from my g920 wheel and pedals, although me of 10 years ago couldn't press the brake pedal, so removed the rubber insert, thinking that would help. Ofc as I got more serious I realised that a super light potentiometer pedal was the opposite of what I needed. Every time I had iracing I got to around 2-2.5k before giving up. 

Upgraded this time to the csl elite v2 pedals and csl dd 8nm, took some time to get used to, but it made all the difference when I did. I'd pretty much been doing all the same things before: looking at telemetry on vrs, trail braking/comparing my telemetry and making changes etc, and it helped to an extent with the old pedals, but really clicked with the new ones. 

I've pretty much just been riding that wave for the last couple months. And then racecraft wise, just focusing on quali and then keeping my nose clean in the race. Getting into the higher splits/being around the top guys is so helpful, being behind someone slightly quicker than you, sticking with them in the draft, always helps improve my times/notice what they're doing better than me. 

Then finally just, a lot of laps😅."
"Here, they have a lot of other cool data on the site I think, although I haven't looked into it that much

https://iracingdata.com/charts/irating"
another one asking where is this!
"Nice one man, top 10% is legit! I think we're already fighting a losing battle convincing anyone outiside of motorsport that sim racing isn't just a game. So to outsiders, all we really did was get good at a video game that we've sunk hundreds/thousands of pounds into :/"
"Hahaha, I still haven't ventured out of mx-5s, aside from a couple of time trials to get to c class to give me more options in terms of next series when I decide to try something new. 

And then safety rating, I'm pretty clean in wheel to wheel racing, but fairly unbothered when it comes to picking up off tracks, all the time I don't need to progress my license, I see off tracks as part and parcel of pushing hard. 

Some tracks I won't collect any, but other tracks like oulton park/leguna seca, I don't worry too much, I realise I need to improve that aspect of my racing, but for now it's just taken a back seat ig."
Cheers mate :))
"Oh man, so freaking close. You'll get there for sure! I was bricking it before the race to reach 5k, and the race to reach top 1%, which needed 5052 irating I think. Pretty sure my next dnf is going to be pretty brutal to recover from :/."
Thanks mate :)
Thanks mate :).
"Nah that's fair, I know when I make the shift to a new series I'll be pummelled for a while while I get up to speed. But it's not that I've been trying to farm irating, I just havent felt like moving on/dropping a ton of money to enter a new series.

 It's a stupid/unrealistic perspective, but my thought process so far has been ""well I didn't win the mx-5 championship yet, so why move on"". Realistically that won't happen unless a few of the elite guys decide not to compete next season, but that's where my head has been at until now. 

You're right though, having an irating goal isn't the right way of looking at it, and trying a new series will probably improve my driving as a whole, so I will do it at some point.

 Out of curiosity, is it much easier to gain irating in top split mazdas compared to other series? The highest  sof race I've seen is 4.2k, so I guess it can get higher in some other series? 

Having said that, the guy leading the championship rn has the 3rd highest irating on the service, so I don't really consider racing mazdas to be ""farming"" irating, but im open to being wrong/curious if the competition is even more brutal in other series?"
"Cheers mate, appreciate it 😊"
"Cheers mate! 3k when you don't have a ton of time is insanely good, I've been sinking far too much time into iracing to reach the 5k mark, over 200 starts this season already 😅. 

I haven't really thought about it in terms of percentages, but roughly speaking, upto around .5% off yeah. I think one week this season I might have matched it, not 100% sure though tbh. 

Generally I use vrs before the week prior to get upto speed/reach the point where I struggle to see differences in the telemetry, then my ""practice"" after that is basically just running races, more fun than beating myself up trying to find the final few tenths 😅."
"Knowing when to pick your battles is also a big one for me, especially near the front of the pack. Better to spend the first couple laps in p2/p3 and start to gap the rest of the pack, than to waste time battling and bring those behind back into contention"
"Thanks! Yeah you’re absolutely right but there are certainly bigger money sink hobbies, my golf budget would certainly reflect this. Currently racing with a G920 like you were and planning a big upgrade soon so the hole of money will continue to grow haha"
Thx for the answer. Now go to 6000 ;)
"I think it’s easier to get to 5k iRating with the mx-5. Some track even I feel like I could massively improve my IR I just drive it back to back to back. 

Great achievement nevertheless."
"I'm at 4200-4300 range atm but 5k is the goal, so it's cool to see this! :)"
"GT3 races in particular have a lot of very competitive splits. I’m comfortable in mx5 keeping up with the fastest drivers, but in GT3 my pace is like 3k IR. And then theres some smaller communities in other series where people have just spent a lot of time in that particular car and will smoke anyone who just decides to dabble."
"Top split mazda SoF is always weird because you have 2-3 people that are high iRating and fast, inflating the SoF. The rest of the field is usually half a second behind them and usually don't even have half their iRating.."
"Nice! So good pace and you must be good a race management too since you're getting good points. I know a few super-fast 2K that can beat me in qualifying times, but inevitably wreck within the first 5 minutes of the race.

That's pretty much my process too. Just curious what other fast people are doing. ☺ I think I matched pace once this year too, actually in the MX-5 at Oulton. Something about that week just clicked and it was a blast! I race MX-5 occasionally, so I hope to battle you soon! GT4 is awesome too if you ever want to move up. The Merc with a good setup probably feels most like the MX-5 to me."
"that's always my goal too, get away THEN fight.  lap 1 i rarely go for moves unless it's a mistake from car ahead.  qualify well and the rest is ez."
"Yeah you're right for sure, certainly to get started the cost isn't so bad. Although a word of warning, once you start down the upgrade path it might be hard to stop. Certainly feels that way for me. Managed to survive a decade without upgrading, but now that I've upgraded once its like opening Pandora box. A solid rig and haptics are next on the list for me, but if/when I get them I'm sure the next thing will be around the corner😅"
"Ahhhh😂, I think this is unobtainable without more upgrades/ improving my raw pace somehow😅. I already don't have that much raw pace over the 3k plus guys, just manage to maximise my results better."
"Good to know, I have been wondering if that's the case. I'm curious to see how big of a hit I'll take when I move to a new series."
It is much easier. PCup or vrs sprint 5k irating are different beasts.
"You've got this man, 100% you'll get there!"
"Funny you should say that, I was just taking a look at some of the gt3 results and the sofs are insane, consistent 4k fields across a grid of 20 is wild. Think that might be the route I end up going down, if I can cope with being humbled like that 😅. Might take some seasons to get there/accumulate the content without crippling me 😅"
Yeah that's fair tbh. During non peak times its like this for sure. During peak times though its quite normal for half the field to have pace.
So in other series the competition is deeper into the pack you'd say?
"Honestly I think race management is the critical bit, I'm also super closely matched on pace to much lower rated guys, but like you say, they'll wreck or battle too much sacrificing time. 

Funny you should say that, Oulton this week has been a struggle for me, feels like you need to have the car on a knife edge to be quick, especially through the chicanes of the international layout. 

But for sure race management is where its at, this week I went something like 25+ races before I had one finish outside the top 5. It's probably been my most consistent week, even though the raw pace isn't quite there. 

I have test driven the mclaren gt4, felt super nice and easy to drive, so gt4 may well end up being my next stepping stone. 

I'm sure I'll see you around at some point! My iracing user is thomas noakes4, so say hi if you see me!"
"Its definitely the way to go! Took me a lot of races to learn this though tbh, used to always make the move/defend for my life against faster guys. Somewhere along the way I stopped thinking about whoever was right infront/behind, and started thinking about maximising my result/minimising my time to the chequered flag"
"That’s some good advice / warning lol. Appreciate it and good luck out there! I only race MX5s too so I’m sure we’ll meet again, even if not as anonymous redditors haha"
"Cheers, man. Just chipping away at it atm, hopefully I'll get some time this week to farm Sandown in GT4/Sportscars before I go back to GT3's next week, haven't really progressed this season yet as it was all spent on D24hr practice, but now we are thru that race, bring on the journey again. :)"
"Yeah, Oulton does not forgive mistakes and I definitely felt on the knife edge the whole time. Unconventional reference points (like trees, stains on the pavement, etc) were key for Oulton since a lot of corners are awkward and have few reference points. Definitely good for points though since a lot of people miss the mark and go off line easily.

  
Okayama is my favorite track, so I may pop in to a race at least once this week. I'll look out for you in the future though and say hi!"
people don't realize the difference between 3-5k rarely is THAT much faster lap times... a 3k can out qualify 5-6k guys  often.
"Haha, at this point we've probably already been in a race together and just don't know it 😂"
"I'm curious, how do you rate gt4 racing? I haven't ventured out of mx-5s yet, but I test drove the mclaren 570s during the last down time, and it seemed lovely to drive, so I'm thinking about that for my next series. Imagine there is probably a bit more competition towards the sharp end of the grid?"
"Honestly, this is so true! The amount of times I end up with 2.5-3.5k guys matching me for pace/ being outright faster than me is shocking. But then they go and bin it midway through the race and I pick up the place 😅. 

Still hurts my ego a little when they're lapping faster than me, but hey if it didn't hurt then I wouldn't have pushed myself to improve as much as I have, so it's a double edged sword."
"I enjoy it, I prefer the longer Sportscars series races, I love Multiclass racing, I generally find the fixed GT4 a bit messy sometimes because it's only 15 minutes, where Sportscars runs over 30mins but then you have LMP3's and that brings its own set of challenges. I generally find I qualify in the top 5 or so, and as long as no one gets desperate, it's good fun. 

I bounce between a few series, GT4/Sportscars in GT4's, Imsa/Vrs in the GT3's, Pcup & GTE, and occasionally, if the combo suits me I'll jump in the FF1600

In GT4's I run the merc, but tbh the bop's aren't too bad normally, and you can be competitive in everything on the grid."
"That's good to know, thanks man :). The bop was something I was wondering about actually, when I finally do step out of mazdas that first season is going to hurt the wallet, so it's good to know I'd at least be fairly competitive without needing to buy all the cars on top of the tracks."

Race control is separate from the drivers, host a recorded drivers’ meeting before each race, and record a race review to review cautions/stages/penalty decisions in full detail as objectively as possible.
Broadcasted, well-sponsored, pays a little per race  (I made back far more than my entry fee by the end of a season), and the sponsors provide a bunch of cool season-end prizes.

I really appreciate all the info man.   So far it seems integrity is a solid league.   Will for sure be checking it out.
"easy anty-cheat is what iRacing uses against cheaters.  It's just that Windows had an accidental failure with it.  This does not mean that you are a cheater or that you need to reinstall something from scratch.  This is just a random failure that could have happened even for any other reason.  You just take it to heart.  You're just unlucky because it's happening in race. 
With same luck you can have BSOD while use calculator."
"Thanks for the info. 

I did install a new Anti-Virus today. I'm wondering if that caused an issue?"
Tbh you don't need any antivirus software installed. Just let the Windows Defender do the work. If you're not clicking any suspicious links then you're good.
">Is iRacing VR still basically unplayable with an AMD GPU?

No

But...

When was it unplayable? I had a 5700xt up to 1.5 years ago and had satisfactory results using vr (Q2) yes its not as good as Nvidia which is why I upgraded but VR with AMD is very much playable"
"I have the same GPU with a 7800x3d and quest 3. I can get get a consistent 90fps with decent image quality or 72fps with great image quality. It does require some tuning but that’s the nature of VR it seems. 
I use openXR instead of Oculus. I followed the VR guide in the forums for graphic settings and use oculus display tools to adjust the bit rate and other settings. I use a wired link as well, never tried wireless or virtual desktop. Post your settings to get more specific feedback"
"dude.... rx7900xt, ryzen 5 7600, quest 3... 90fps all over the place with just shadows turned down - no issues at all."
I have been racing in vr for two years on an rx4700xt. I don’t know if the issues were with newer cards but it has run just fine for me.
"It was never unplayable. It is slower per $ spent, so $500 Nvidia GPU will be faster than $500 AMD GPU, unlike many other games where the opposite is true. But otherwise it runs fine."
"6800xt here and works very nicely with quest 3. Definitely no capping with gpu, but faster cpu would be great to have (I have amd 5900x)."
"Huh?

RX6800 16GB, R7-5800X (Not the XD). 32GB 3600mhz RAM, iRacing on SS drive.

Reverb G2.

Track and car depending will be 90hz. I can tolerate down to about 75hz. Depends on the options and track type. Oval I find more tolerable to framerate dips. 

You need to run via OpenXR and the toolkit. My card won't do foveated which sucks. I can still find room to tweak  but this is fine as is. I got the XFX MERC RX6800 during the mining/pandemic craze and I don't want to say what I paid for it. So it will stay in the system for a while as a sunk cost fallacy."
"Unplayable? Absolutely not. However, iRacing does have SPS implemented which gives Nvidia cards a HUGE performance boost in VR. If you are primarily doing VR just for iRacing, I would say it is worth getting an equivalent Nvidia card."
It'll run. It just runs much worse than the comparable Nvidia card. Going from 6900xt to 3090 meant 90 fps and low settings to 120fps on pretty high settings.
"i dont know what is up with iracing and amd gpus, im reletively new here, but in general that should be able to run vr. i have a 5600x and a 3070 hooked up to an og vive and i racing runs fine, til i get a tracking error and the screen blanks out but thats a local problem i need to figure out."
"I've just sold an AMD 6700XT because it was garbage and I had your exact processor.

7900xtx here and VR with the quest 2 works fine for me. Better than it does on ACC. A little smoother.
"I was having issues with my 3060 12G on OpenVR as  I know SteamVR and iRacing have issues with each other, which can cause performance drops. OpenXR worked much better with my WMR Headset. 

I just Bought a 7800XT 2 weeks ago and OpenXR runs even better, but with some red flickering on the screen I've swapped back to OpenVR which still has its performance leaching, but can easily run my headset at almost max settings with little issue. Frames in a full lobby drop from 90hz to about 60hz. 

All in all, with the right settings and such, it's very much playable in VR with a AMD graphics card."
"I'm easily able to hit 90fps on a 6700xt and a 7700x CPU.  With about 1.2-1.3x resolution on a quest 2

It's not on max settings, but it's far from unplayable.  And I could probably hit 120 (or increase super sampling) if I turned down a few more settings.

Frankly, I don't notice the difference in settings compared to a single monitor with most things maxed (aside from obvious things, like pixel density)."
I have an Rx6700xt and iracing runs fine on my Quest 2. I can't see how a 7800xt would shit the bed with a Quest 3.
"I’ve got a 5800X and 6800 (non-XT). Very playable with my Quest 3 but will definitely go nvidia for my next gpu due to the benefits. I think my 5800X might be my bottleneck in IRacing right now tho. My gpu sits pretty comfortably at low settings, but races and certain tracks will cause stutters in certain areas. Usually I can test drive or practice in an empty server fine, and more cars make it worse."
I was using a Lenovo Explorer headset in iracing in 2019 on an AMD system. Never had any problems.
I run 5800x3d with 4080 and use openxr toolkit to make it look crisp and run 90f and almost everthing on max I think your 7800xt should do just fine
"I use it every day with my HP Reverb G2, I love it."
There used to be stuttering issues on some AMD cards several years ago. But to my knowledge those issues were fixed a while ago. I don't really know all the details though since I never ran AMD.
"I’m late to the party and you’ve received a lot of bad answers in this thread so hopefully you see this one.

iRacing plays no part in the issue you’re experiencing. The problem is the pairing of an AMD GPU and a Quest headset. A google search will explain it better than I can but in short the Quests are Android devices so your GPU’s encoder needs to do a lot of work to translate its output into something the Quest headset can work with. The current generation of AMD GPU’s  are very weak in this regard so their graphical capabilities are effectively bottlenecked by their encoding capabilities.

Switching to either an NVidia GPU or a headset that isn’t a Quest will net you much better performance."
"Ive seen a lot of comments around here about players having basically everything off to be able to run VR on iracing on some good AMD cards. Got the idea that It couldnt perform well at all. But that's good information, might give it a try, thanks."
"I dont own a vr headset yet. I was just wondering If It would be viable in the future since everyone says AMD performa poorly on iracing and NVidia is the way to go. Really apreciate your answer, Its what I was looking for. Thanks."
"Thanks for replying. Thats really good to hear, will definetly try it in the future."
"I see... I must have gotten the wrong idea from some posts I was finding. Everyones reply has been very helpfull, thanks a lot."
Yeah maybe a 5800x3D would be Key to a better performance.
I must be doing something seriously wrong; I'm on a 5800x3d + 6700xt and I can't get constant 90 even on absolutely poopy settings. OpenXR + Virtual Desktop because Link is trash for me for some reason
Awesome. Whats your CPU?
">players having basically everything off to be able to run VR 

That's bullshit pal, I raced on high enough graphics obviously had pit detail off (have this set to minimum now with a 4070ti) and crowds etc but the graphics were set pretty high enough, I had 80fps with 1.3 resolution. Some tracks struggled more than others but I'd just tweak something else down but it was satisfactory.

I got a pain in my hoop adjusting from track to track and was waiting a year for the Nvidia 40 series to drop so pulledthe trigger when the 4070ti came out, is it better yeah but I still ain't got everything maxed out 🥹"
">Ive seen a lot of comments around here

Source: Internet comments. 

lol"
"It’s not that it’s unplayable, it’s just that the stereo whatchamacallit feature (SPSS? Idk) that Nvidia has and iRacing supports means you get a much better experience per dollar with a team green card. For most people the CPU frame times are the performance limiter in iRacing, but for some reason I don’t really understand SPSS makes your CPU work better too. 

I think the correct advice is: if you have a gaming PC already, don’t worry about it. Follow the guides and you’ll be able to get a good experience by turning super sampling down or up as necessary.  *BUT,* if you’re building a new PC or buying a new card specifically for iRacing in VR you should definitely go for an Nvidia card."
"a lot of people will lie about their ability and knowledge to fiddle with the settings

VR is unfortunately not plug and play if you account for the average user's computer proficiency 

maybe they have a lot of system bloat
maybe their drivers are not up to date
maybe their system is throttling because of a bad paste job or one of their case fans is broken and they just dont know about it
maybe they think they are running openXR but actually are not
maybe they have cubemaps enabled and just not know about it

the list goes on

i ran VR (rift S) flawlessly, with HDR on,  on a 3600x and 5700xt"
"Seconding the x3d upgrade, went from the processor you have to the 5800x3D and it really helped. Was using a 5700XT and a Rift S, ran fine with medium settings. When I upgraded to nVidia it was for the extra performance but not because the AMD was unusable."
"Yeah, it would be interesting to make a comparison. Anyways, it is easily possible to have constant 90 fps besides starts where my fps drops to maybe 70 or so and easily driveable. And in my opinion the game looks good and sharp after a few tweaks with openxr toolkit. One thing to note, though, is you can't use foveated rendering from xrtoolkit with iracing with amd gpu, but you can with nvidia (with amd direct x11 is not supported for foveated rendering). That is a really useful tool with other more performance intensive games, and for a bit lower end machines in iracing also."
And as you have a good gpu pushing rendering res/ eye higher with openxr toolkit is a good idea as it seems mainly affect gpu and makes quite a big difference in image sharpness.
I have an i5 12600K
Yup lmao
"SPS allows the GPU to render both eyes ""at once"" with a great performance gain (due to reduced CPU load). It's not quite twice as fast as non-SPS, but it's more like 1.5x as fast."
"I have a R7-5800X. 

You think going to the R7-5800XD would be worth it? It's slower just has that extra cache. Seems my money might be better spent on a GPU but eh..."
"Look at benchmarks. It’s true that iracing runs better on Nvidia cards especially in VR because of SPS but it’s nowhere near unplayable.

If you’re buying a card for iracing specifically you’ll be better off with nvidia; it doesn’t mean if you have an AMD card it’ll run like shit, it’s just better perf/cost ratio with nvidia"
"lol, thank you for the translation!"
"Thats great to know. As I like playing other games other than sim, its a much better choice for me. Glad to know Ill have a good experience despite not having a NVidia GPU."
"Nexus Sim Racing has an IMSA style league starting up next month. Races are 75 minutes (a few “endurance” rounds are 105 minutes). Free entry, open setups, and fully broadcasted. For more info and discord link, visit the website: https://nexussimracing.com/"

"There are no other hillclimb courses on iRacing. I am hopeful that we can someday get Pikes Peak, though."
"If you want more ""open road"" courses like this, I'd highly recommend checking out Assetto Corsa. You can get it cheap and there's a huge modding community. There's a mod featuring a bunch of real-life canyon roads outside LA called ""LA Canyons"", or streets through Tokyo called ""Shutoku Revival Project"".

Assetto Corsa doesn't really compete with iRacing in terms of multiplayer competition, but it's still a solid sim with good physics and graphics."
Every now and then someone hosts this with the Vee and no fuel. Really fun soapbox race.

Definitely wish there are more
Mt Washington is the only point to point track in iRacing currently
maybe tourist layout of nords?
"WHAT?!  There are point to point tracks in the game?!  

BRB in 12hrs!  (Runs to wallet and PC)"
"Eh. Unlikely until they end their deal with Gran Turismo. 

I went there this year and GTs logo was *everywhere*"
A proper run up the peak would be amazing. Just did the drive for the first time this year and what an unreal place to see in person.
"There's an import of the GTAV map too if you want a proper county-sized map to drive around in. Plus, AC has alot more variety with it's street cars, even outside of car mods."
"AC is generally the sim I let people drive when they come over. Can just throw em in a Miata and let em drive LAC or shutoku. AC for street cars, iracing for race cars."
"For hillclimb I recommend Akina, Mount Myog, Irohazaka as well all fun with a street car"
"I don't have the track and only really seen it in the F1 video recently, can you make the whole thing just by rolling? Sounds awesome"
Also Bathurst - Mount Panorama was built as a scenic tourist drive back in the 30s and the race track follows the original layout. It's still a two-way public road on non-race days.
Guess I walked into that one
That’s already in the game.  It simply just changes the location of the start line as “tourists” enter the track on the long straight and not near the pits.
Is there anything different about that besides the big cockblock of cones at the start/finish that forces you to go slow?
iRacing gives no fucks. They'll put Gran Turismo billboards in their game. Just gotta get Polyphony and Sony to not be dicks about it
I can’t imagine that you can copyright a public road. Just call it “Pikes Peak Toll Road”. 
Which is silly considering pikes peak isnt even in gt7
"Yeah I completely GT having that license, console's shouldn't get license monopoly."
It would be REALLY cool if for one of the alternate layouts it included the “original” Pikes Peak (aka all dirt).
"Not only can you make it all the way down just on your initial push off, you'll be nearly shitting yourself on several corners thinking you're about to go flying off the side of the mountain. It's a lot of fun."
Gotta be the best origin story of any race track in the world.
"""Scenic tourist drive"" that was a cover for a race track.


They intended racing from the start."
i mean its technically a public road
Funnily enough Tsukuba in GT has an iRacing logo (Pitlane) and iRacing Tsukuba has a GT billboard outside of T2
Unfortunately Polyphony has an exclusivity deal and they're just sitting on it.
"Thinking? I remember my first time finally getting to the dirt section and promptly flying off. Next time I made it through and then went off at a section later. There's always that ""I can keep a little more speed here"""
Bring back Daytona on the beach
"That's like most historic tracks. Started as public roads and then changed to a track. ,"
That's exactly what I was referencing. I'm glad somebody got it!
"Do it, but instead of NASCAR - send IndyCar."
"Yes, but in the case of Bathurst, the tourist road was specifically proposed by a racer who didn't think the local government would outright approve of the construction of a race track, and then he came to them with the idea of holding races on it after it had already been built. Or so I've been told."
"It was actually the mayor of Bathurst, Martin Griffin, who wanted to build a race circuit but knew he'd never get the funding so he conned the New South Wales state government into paying for its construction under the premise that it would be a scenic drive that would bring tourists to the area. Hence 90 years later it remains a state road with a 60km/h speed limit (and you had better believe the local police cut plenty of laps around there every day looking for people living out their V8 Supercar fantasies! 😅). Turn two is still named after him - Griffin's Bend.

It's the paint scheme inspiration. I don't care about the spellings because when I create them in Trading Paints I will obviously put the right logos on the cars. It's all about what they could look like. A year ago AI could barely get 2 letters in a row correct. Now it can get much closer and sometimes spot on. I don't care at all about the spellings - just the concepts. Just thought some of these came out really nice and wanted to share. It's not for everyone.

Definite deviation from the original AI scheme but I did try to use parts of what it created as inspiration and changed the scheme some. This is my interpretation on an updated Frosted Flakes car that is now on my Trading Paints."
They’re AI renders

That’s what happen when you buy your car on Wish
Those are some nice SRs.
I see some familiar names in that picture
Yea I didn’t even notice at first honestly 😅😂
Lol 😂 it’s funny because I had also raced him earlier in the week but crashed
"We mighta been in the same race, I swear there was like 4 restarts that immediately went back to yellow"
"I've had this happen in the past, and I will file it as a bug each time. If a car spins on a restart you shouldn't get a penalty for passing them."
The setup this week is the loosest setup I've ever run in Indycar. That combined with the 130 degree track temp makes the whole thing like driving on ice.
I JUST finished a race here with 12 cautions that ran for almost an hour and a half. The setup is loose but man these cars get HUGE runs way too quickly for a lot of people to handle. With 2 to go there were only 5 of us left in the race out of a field of 25 and we still finished under yellow. 3 cars crossed the line and it just wasn’t fun pacing for that long so often.
"Pro tip. For this week at Atlanta do starts/restarts in 2nd gear. Figured this one out after lap 1. Barely held onto it starting in 1st and 5 cars spun off in front of me. 

Normally Indy you can easily start in 1st gear but Atlanta doesn't like that."
had this same thing happen to me a few weeks ago. Super frustrating
"Yes, even the leader spun on his restart... by the way it can happen, I understand, but the penalties are quite unfair"
Yeah I guess if a car registers a 2x for out of control or a 1x for off track it should be waived. I think the hard part might be if a car hits the wall and sticks or bounces off but doesn’t get any Xs
"I filed a bug report to warn them, I'll see what they say. The problem is the driver probably had a 2x first for Contact and not ""Lost control"". I probably had the penalty because I went over the line, not just for passing him"
"Yes it's quite a joke, the average caution every race is about 7... a third of the race. We warn people not to go full throttle with the first gear but they just do it"
"Personally I think the balance is perfectly fine, ive had no issues with it even after dropping the front bar a lot"
Oh I might actually like the setup this week then. The fixed series always feels annoyingly tight with too much downforce.
"If the car is loose and the ARBs are at 6(front) and 1(rear) put in some negative weight jacker. 

For me the setup still felt a little tight this week. I put arb at 5/3 with a few clicks of positive weight jacker."
I started in 1st gear in my race there this week but you have to ease on the throttle like when you drive the SF23. If you just mash the loud pedal you could be caught out quickly.
That's what we told the other drivers but they still tried :(
"I've always thought that it's something that should be able to be protested but I guess safety rating isn't that big of a deal seeing as you can easily just get it back but still, it's frustrating when stuff like this happens"
"No 2x-es for contact except for on Dirt, it's either a 0x or a 4x

also going over the line shouldn't be an issue when it's legal to use as racing surface on the quadoval"
This season the stock setup has had max farb and minimum rarb. Between adjusting that and weight jacker it shouldn't be an issue tuning out understeer.
Try it out! It's certainly different.
"It's oval, you can fix it up with the weight jacker pretty easily."
Took this advice before I saw it and it definitely felt better. When the pack actually spreads out you get some great slingshot racing but it’s difficult for most of the field to even survive long enough to experience a green flag run. Definitely enjoying it when it happens though!
Yep. But I always picked up places on the restart because people using 1st were either feathering too much or too little.
"Sorry, I was talking about contacts with the wall, where it's 0x for small contact and 2x for med to big contact. Just to state that it would be difficult for the game to tell me ""you can overtake, he's lost control"" while the driver just had a contact with the wall"
"I won a race earlier this week when the final 45 laps were under green.

Tires were shot and I was saving fuel. But the top split or two is usually only 3 maybe 4 cautions and they all happen earlier."
oh yep fair enough but a 2x is generally big enough to cause serious damage
Frankly I’m always third split because I’m just not that quick! But when it works it works so well.
"Stop worrying about IR and start worrying about having fun racing.

This whole entire system is meant for you to have 10th place finish. You're not supposed to win races unless you put in the time to get mega fast, at which point, your rating will go up, and you'll go back to being 10th.

My above comment only applies to well subscribed series like GT3 or MX5 or GR. If you're on series where there is one split, you might win stuff. But if there are 6-7-8 splits, the whole system puts you to where you neither win, or finish last.

So stop caring so much and start having more fun"
"Right, wrong, or indifferent; iRacing is not a service where you can expect to regularly win unless you are a very very small number of exceptionally gifted drivers.

It just is what it is. Some people like that; some people don’t. But it’s not something you can realistically change. 

Adjusting expectations is probably the best thing you can do; unless you think there are things you could do to genuinely improve your pace. Getting taken out is part of it too. It’s not great (it sucks in fact), but ultimately if you let it get to you; you are going to be miserable. Remember this is supposed to be fun! And if it isn’t fun; adjust what needs to be adjusted to make it fun. Maybe switch to a different game for a while? A different series? Race against the AI for a while? Give dirt or oval or road (whatever it is you perhaps haven’t done) a chance?

Chasing iRating is ultimately a fools errand. It’s not like leveling up in an MMO. It’s a system that is designed to plateau. It’s designed to find your skill level and then hold you there so that in the average race you finish in the middle of the pack. Of course; it rarely actually works exactly like that but that is how it’s DESIGNED to operate and that’s the goal in creating it. So hitting a certain point and not progressing is just… what’s SUPPOSED to happen. 

Certainly could consider a coach, upgrades to your rig, or adjusting the way you practice to find a few tenths here or there. But ultimately, have fun! If you’re not having fun, then it’s just a grind; a grind with a built in wall and that just sounds miserable."
"Both previous comments have some good advice. One thing I'd add, not quite ""the common denominator"" thing, but more, absolute accountability. There are always going to be people that wreck infront of you/ram into you etc, and even though it's not your fault, it doesn't mean there aren't ways to minimise the risk. 

If you put accountability on you, even for the wrecks that are blatantly not your fault, then you have the mindset of ""what could I have done differently"" rather than ""I stood no chance"". Of course there are times its unavoidable, but backing off for example when it looks like people in front are going to come together, to give yourself a bit more time to react. Or letting a faster/more aggressive driver past for example. 

Something that helped me was thinking less about battling each driver around me, and more about minimising my total race time to the chequered flag, so getting into less scraps etc."
"Sometimes it's good to take a break and remember why you started iRacing in the first place. If you're mostly focused on your iRating, you're probably going to have a bad time overall. It'll fluctuate and eventually find a place and stay roughly there. That's what it's there for, as you already know.

That said, if you're super competitive and really care about your iRating, there's a place for that in iRacing as well. That's a place where the answer is simply; good practice. Hours and hours of good practice will pay dividends over time. There's no secret to improving beyond putting in the time. You put in the time, you'll find that pace, and be in a position where other people's issues are out of reach to you."
"Until you adopt the mentality that 100% of wrecks are avoidable you’re not ever going to stop being caught up in wrecks.  You shouldn’t get mad and place blame on others.  You should understand that there are a lot of careless drivers (including PLENTY who enjoy drinking and racing) and it’s completely on you to avoid them.  The best way to accomplish this is by watching your post race replays.  Never think about how stupid the guy who hit you was.  Think only of ways you could have avoided his stupidness (including going off track if that’s what it takes).  

I watch every single replay.  It helped me go from a “top 10 finisher” to someone who wins or at least finishes on the podium very regularly.  3 wins, 3 2nds and 2 top 5’s in my last 8 races.  I don’t over analyze things though.  If it’s a race I started from Poll and had 0 incidents I watch the whole replay at max speed (very helpful for seeing your racing line and you’ll be surprised how a blimp view at 8x speed can help you find better lines).  If it wasn’t a wire to wire win I watch the majority of the race sped up and only slow the replay down to watch incidents and overtakes.  

And the easiest route to fix all your problems is to get an online racing coach.  They’ll diagnose all your tendencies that are causing repeated issues and probably help you start competing for more podiums.  

Like others have said, it’s just a game and it’s just for fun.  Gotta find series that bring you joy regardless of the result."
"if you're getting wrecks that often at 2k it is 100% your fault


but without videos it's really difficult for people to give you any actionable tips "
"I just finished a push to 3k and it was torture. It honestly felt like a job and not fun like compared to when I used to hop into any race that look fun. Instead I practiced all week and only did one track and series to try to maximize points. Now that I've hit 3k, I'm just going to go back to having fun and whatever happens to my IR happens. It's funny because if you look at a lot of high IR people, their history will show just one track repeated a crap-ton so they have mastered it and maximize points every race. It just gets old for me so I really don't care if my IR tanks now since I know what I'm capable of. As long as I'm in a competitive split for me, I don't care anymore.

My biggest tip if you want to continue is to learn how to predict accidents to get out of the way, plus learn how to defend in potential collision zones. If there is a hairpin coming up and you know it's a popular passing zone and the person behind is within .3 - .5 seconds behind, try to cover the inside early so that if they blow the corner trying to out-brake you, they will go off track and not into you. Also be ok with losing the position if they attempt a risky pass and you need to hit the brakes, go off line, or even off track to avoid a potential collision. 0 points is much better than -70 points and you'll probably have a better next race. I also started to lift a little on straights to let people significantly faster by. If they are at least .5 seconds faster a lap and it's early in the race, there is no point in risking crashing out from them desperately trying to pass or being pressured into a race ending mistake to try to avoid the inevitable.

Best of luck to you!"
"Very much depends on the nature of the braking point (is it a hard braking point for a slow corner? or is it a fast corner where you don't need to brake much at all?), and what kind of car you're driving (does it have high downforce? Does it have ABS? etc.) 

/s"
"Yes, stop putting value in it because at the end of the day you're the person who is stressed out about it the most. You joined iRacing(most likely) because you love to race at heart, yes we all love the idea of improving and continuing the forever uphill momentum, winning race after race, that dopamine sure is awesome. Until we reach some grand peak and then what? You hit a new 4 digit number compared to the guy who didn't get as high as you, it means nothing. Somewhere along the way, you forgot why you signed up for iRacing, and put more value in a 4 (or some cases 3 digit) number.

Go back to racing because you like racing a certain car/track combo, accept that sometimes you will end up back in the pits because of your error or sometimes someone else, sometimes you miss it sometimes you don't."
"Learn how to enjoy the process of getting better and u can't lose, its all mentality, u think it's harder then it actually is."
"When you’re at a breaking point, take a break!  You’re frustrated, it’s not enjoyable, and you’re building up resentment. Go see the family, do a puzzle, learn cross country skiing, anything. When you come back you will be more calm, less tense, and more resilient. 

At that point I recommend mixing it up a bit. Try a different car, run a league race, join a team. This will be the best way to break out of the rut and grow."
"Yeah I focus on having fun. So I ignore IR and SR.  If I crash early I quit and forfeit and find another race.  If that happens too many times and my A license is at stake, I’ll farm SR in the back of Advanced Miata’s and then I’m back!"
"If you are a road racer, try ovals or vice versa. Or even a different discipline within road. I get to the point where the game begins to feel more like a job than a hobby trying to chase or maintain IR and its really hard to just forget about the number that ranks your skill level. Taking a break from the game can definitely help, but I have found a lot of stress free fun in trying other disciplines. I mained open wheelers when I first subscribed to the service and plateaued after a few seasons, then switched my focus to GT cars and once again plateaued after a few seasons. I can maintain around 2.2 - 2.5k IR which is perfect to keep me in the middle to back of the pack in the top split for whatever I run lol.  

I recently started running ovals and for whatever reason, I don't really care about my oval IR like I do my road IR, and I have been having a blast learning the new discipline and climbing the ranks. Just had my first 2 oval wins in D class last week back to back, something I haven't experienced in a long time on road due to my IR. Hopefully I will be able to take that mentality of not caring back with me when I run road again and hopefully have learned skills that I can use in road racing. But iRacing has so much content to offer, although I know this brings on another level of costs in cars and tracks. But give the free content a try, you may be surprised at how much fun you may have even if you are like me and have no interest in that other discipline in real life."
Switch to a less wrecky series.
"I won my first race in the 1st time on iracing… then a couple podiums and some other wins. I can easily get a top 5 actually. I also been sim racing since 2007 or so. But i feel you, i was 1980 irating when i was in D class and 3 races after i droped 400 iR because of people wrecking me out. I still race to enjoy myself but i do put pressure on me also.  I usually race at weekends and kinda prepare first before signing in to a race. Last race i had to give up first place in phoenix FF1600 to avoid being punted by the second car… he won but still good result and fun. So please just have fun and dont mind losing some places :)"
Try joining an organized league. The right league will minimize all that you describe. It’s a lot more fun and you meet people to improve with.
"Iracing and competitive sim racing in general is an anxiety factory. Most of my wrecks and lost wins are attributed to my own anxiety getting the best of me or others not controlling theirs. Then there’s the during or post race depression. I tend to take racing very personally so it hits hard for me when I fuck up or somebody takes me out. Conversely wins feel mile high and when I get back to back wins, that’s like magic for me. 

I don’t have advice but I feel your pain"
"I've been where you have been before. I walked away from the sim for three years. Just getting back into it again. I just had to change my mental approach and just enjoy the time I spend on it versus being results driven. Learning step by step. but yes definitely not fun when you have 60 to 90 min of free time,  so you log into a session and some jackwagon takes you out, definitely can make the blood boil."
Race other series. Race slower cars. Forget ratings and focus on having fun.
"I wish you could permanently hide irating. I don't like chasing a number and worrying about the number going down.


SR makes sense so you know that you're not being safety focused. "
"My IR is shit because I don't practice enough and jump around series at random, but I enjoy the hell out of racing."
I'm not really worried about winning outright exactly. My goal is to be top 10 of not top 5 and a win is just a bonus. If I'm winning all the time I feel like that would be boring.
"Great answer, I had never thought about it like this but this has really cheered me up, it's just common sense too when you think about it. Thanks, this should be on a bumper sticker in some format or another!"
"Yeah this exactly, it is totally natural to plateau, and if you’ve gotten to 2k, then congratulations, you’re already good!  (better than like 80% of all drivers).  Most of us just aren’t going to keep getting better indefinitely."
"ah, the [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)"
Your last sentence is my approach to the morning commutes. Mental health has increased considerably.
"100% this!!!

I had this mental change and it has changed my racing so much!"
I generally try to be pretty cautious. Not that I don't make mistakes that are my fault but unless the guy chasing me is of similar speed I don't fight super hard when it's obvious they are much faster.
Last sentence is the best advice I think one can possibly give.
"I'm definitely more on the competitive side. I can't race in real life so this is my best alternative and the best platform to do it on. If I can just keep my IR above 2k I would like to try letting things be what they are. But for me personally, I'm not satisfied below 2k since there are splits where I can notice a quality dip just by a few hundred IR split."
"I try to recognize what I should do to avoid wrecks. My last one for example was me going down a corkscrew turn, two guys a few places ahead spin, I react instantly but get rear ended from the guy behind, then the initial spinner starts to reverse and tags my rear quarter which sends me into a 180, then as I'm sitting still in the middle of traffic so I don't do what the guy just did to me, someone else runs right into me head on. In this case there was literally nothing I could do.


But generally I do try to be honest when assessing my own blame."
Well the problem is that I haven't been 2k since two races after reaching it. Now I've dipped below 1600 for the second time due to wrecks. I can handle being slow and outclassed but getting wrecked by people pretending I'm not there is what I'm trying to avoid now.
I try to be active when looking for potential collisions but lately I haven't been able to get out of them. The first lap that's about the only thing I'm thinking about.
Yeah I'm just in a rut of bad results. I did have two wins in F4 but they were easily overshadowed by my other bad race that it's hard to focus on the good times unless I can get my accidents back to an acceptable rate. I don't expect every race to be good but I'm having a hard time not being collected at the moment.
Maybe it's the rate of getting better I'm overestimating but I can't help but feel like I'd be comfortably where my target is if I could not be taken out. That's true of anyone for sure though. We'd all be higher rated if we never got into wrecks.
I was contemplating about stepping away for a bit but I'm also juggling the concept of trying not to be bothered what happens in the race and continue on but take everything one at a time.
"I don't like the idea of letting a bad race go if I only have time for one or two, you know? Since we're not getting paid to race and this is our leasure activity it's 100% a waste of time going through the motions when I would've been much better off doing something else. I'm not expecting EVERY race to be a 0x because things happen even at the professional level, but at the moment I'm just in a very unfavorable cleanliness rut."
"I've never tried another discipline but paved ovals is the only other one that might interest me. I'm not interested in dirt at all. But as you mentioned, when I was 1800+ I would generally always be in the top split unless there were a ton of higher rated players that race. If I can get back and maintain a 2k minimum I feel like I would be much more care free so that's what my goal has been for a while. I can assess where I'd like to be after that."
If you hide licenses you have to look at race results to see your ir.
"I normally don't care about the iRacing rating system, but I do understand to qualify for certain series, the ratings become important. Once I got to D license, I just raced without worrying about ratings. It was the same for C license. Now I see that if I get to the B license, it opens up more series that I'm interested in. Plus I'm only .12 from being promoted, I think. The iRacing ratings game reminds me of gambling with scared money."
"I think you’re still trying too hard. Calm her down, have some fun, as others said, back off a bit, and things will settle out. 

Example: if someone looks like they’re gonna wreck, back out, lose a spot and finish 12th instead of last. Sit back and wait for them to make a mistake for a bit instead of forcing it. If they don’t, chapeau to them. Move onto the next one"
"Nailed it. 

I think people get into the MMO mindset of wanting to keep seeing the stats grow infinitely. But that’s not how iRating is designed."
"Fr, it's so much easier once you let go of the road rage. Now I want an irating for commutes though 😂"
"That's fair, aside from that, the best advise I can give is to work on one lap pace, if you have the pace advantage/can qualify close to the top of your split, you get the benefit of avoiding all the midfield chaos, along with being able to stick in the slipstream of the faster guys, which further helps to improve your laptimes by learning what they do differently. 

Although I do realise that my advice basically just boils down to ""be fast, don't be not fast"". But working on raw pace is never not going to be an advantage, and gives you a chance of being ahead of the chaos rather than behind it :/"
No one has said this yet. Try sticking with one car and one series.
"Sounds like you are trying to avoid incidents, but maybe not always in the best way. Don't be afraid of taking a 1x to go off track to avoid spun out cars, most people don't look ahead and are only fixated on the bumper of the car in front of them. Even if there is no car in front, a lot of people drive through incidents like they don't exist because it's the other cars job to get back on track safely. So stopping on the racing line, even with a spun car in front isn't always the best option.

One thing you can do if you just want to race and not have to worry about IR/SR is don't sign up for the race, wait for the servers to get assigned, if there's multiple splits the higher the server number the lower the SoF, click watch and once you're in you can test drive as a ghost car. You can't start from the grid, but you jump on the end of the train and start racing. Obviously the other cars can't see you so they'll drive like you aren't there but it's a handy way to watch how other drivers race and build up good habits in a race situation that won't end because of someone else's mistake. It's also a great way to try out different series or maybe a track/car combo you're not confident in doing a race."
"I'm around the same range as you. 


A trick I use is to always have a less popular series with really clean racing in my rotation. Makes for easy grinding if I do get a string of bad luck.


My current series of choice for that is the Radical SR10 series. Super fun car and a series generally filled with nice people with solid racecraft."
"If you're being punted in T1 or really the first 5 corners, what has helped me is trying to always be on the inside line (so half the people will fly off the track instead of hitting you) and also lightly start applying the brakes just a little earlier than the leaders. Most of the time people behind you will see your brake lights and start to brake. Watch your mirrors and if they are braking too late and look like they are going to hit you release some brake pedal and get out of the way since you now have that extra space. Just don't brake too early or they will a) not expect it at all and ram into you or b) just drive around you. Braking early isn't an issue early on if you aren't on the front row as most people will be stuck behind a big pack anyways, so if you just brake earlier, but less overall through the first corners and you'll end up in the same position. Another perk is that if you do screw up your braking zone, you have more space to not run into the person in front of you with cold tires. This has 100% helped me and avoids 90% of the turn one craziness."
If you can realign your expectations then that is a good idea. Do whatever it takes to break out of the rut. The goal is to still enjoy it in 5 years and burnout is a real thing
That’s what I do.
"You seem to be talking about Safety Rating, not iRating."
"Yeah, and don’t forget to keep an eye out for those Red Bull liveries"
My sr would forever be in the basement because my work commute is 6 turns over 4 minutes. lol
"I actually find in general if I’m not on a good pace with the top of the pack (qualifying position aside) I’m still way more likely to have incidents. Even if they aren’t 100% on me, being even slightly uncomfortable with the track and its pace can cause accidents both directly and indirectly"
I don't hop around TOO much but I like to mix in F4 since I primarily drive the Ferrari in the Challenge or IMSA series. Ideally I pick one thing a week and focus on that but I haven't ran an entire season with only one car in a while. It kinda depends on what content I've purchased and if I don't have a Ferrari Challenge track one week I'll focus on something else in the mean time.
I have wondered why that series isn't popular. I figured it would be so maybe I can try something like that. I usually do Ferrari or F4 as my primary focus but lately I've been enjoying longer races like IMSA so I did a lot of that more recently. And then the occasional SF23 races which surprisingly I was avoiding wrecks and getting to finishing positions I didn't truly belong in but one contact and it's over in that series so I haven't done much of it at this time.
"I actually was talking about the ratings system in general as I described in the first sentence of my earlier post. When I spoke about being promoted, I assumed people would know that I was talking about the safety rating. But I should've been more clear describing promotion requirements."
How many incidents are you getting involved in on the commute 😂😂😂
"Yeah that's a good point tbh, anytime I feel like I'm lacking pace, I wind up overdriving, losing more time, and like you say, more potential for incidents."
"That’s not one car one series though. People have touched on the higher iR drivers and what their race history is like.

Here is my season curve for the F4 only.

"No, I mean... It's just that... shit. I really pitched that one underhand, didn't I? "
😂😂😂
Could these be featured in nascar 25 video game
No I think a NASCAR 25 game will use the COT
Gently
Both hands unless taking a drink.
"Ask for consent first, remember no answer from the wheel does not mean yes."
"I always do 3-9 and shifting with my middle fingers, but some people do pointer, I don’t think it matters"
Like a normal wheel in a street car hands on 3 an 9.
"Tell your self not to deathgrip, but then constantly deathgrip anyways and constantly feel like you're hanging on for the dear life to the last dregs of grip, most especially when going wheel to wheel "
I wrap my thumbs around my index fingers to lock my hands to the wheel and extend pinky finger as proper as you can to shift like a gentleman.
Supple and gently
If its an F1 style wheel - Hands at 12 and 6.
"Left hand only when in long straights, my right shoulder feels tired as hell from all the left turning throughout the day"
9-3
9 & 3 is the only way.
The same way you would grip your (or someone else's) didgeridoodle. Firm but don't strangle it
I push my ass against my wheel and twerk
With your hands
I like to use my hands. I tried it with my pecker but there was an unfortunate accident involving ffb. I don't like to talk about it...
"My grip is usually at the a quarter past ten position, as opposed to ten past ten when I drove a real car. In ovals, usually at ten past seven."
Caress it. Like you're holding the hand of your new born child. Don't squeeze it. Just hold it gently
"9-3 always, any car, any situation. I either shift with my first two fingers or last three. I'm trying to consciousness use three fingers instead of two because my middle finger started hurting after a while."
Use your middle fingers for the paddles not your index fingers. Just that alone will help immensely
9-3 and use middle finger to shift it
I put my hands at 10:30 and Tuesday and shift with my toes.
With your hands.
You don't want to grip the wheel with your fingers so much as you want to hook your thumbs on the inside and push your palms into the wheel firmly but gently to turn it.
Pinkies out.
"""where do i put my feet?"""
I saw Lando Norris shift with his middle fingers and that changed everything for me. Can't do it any other way now.
"This is the key, don’t death grip it and fight it….are we not doing phrasing anymore?"
For sure. I developed carpel tunnel and turf toe in my braking foot recently. I’m pretty sure sim racing is to blame for that
Beat by 8 minutes.
DONT CHOKE THE CHICKEN BOYS
Or a smoke
"I've always braked on MTB with my middle and ring fingers rather than with point and middle, and shift with middle fingers."
"Way back in the day when i was getting my license,  the handbook used to say 10 and 2. I think they changed it recently because 3 and 9 are safer for airbags"
This is necessary when doing a lap of the nords
"When in doubt, pinky out"
The fuck kinda clocks are in your house?
.....how?
Are you Jean Alesi?
Perfect
I had to grab my wheel in the positions because I was like wtf wait hahaha
do you only drive anti clockwise circuits?
if i don’t deathgrip my f1 wheel it slips am i doing something wrong? currently at 15nm
Or wiping the beads o’ sweat away just before the green flag.
Heathen!! Burn this heretic at once! Point finger only breaking or death!
"Yeah, also on paddle shifters 10-2 you have to either have long fingers or it’s gonna be uncomfortable to shift.

There’s a reason we don’t have any more Jean Alesis in F1 anymore.

Especially in an lmp2 or GTP this week.
He’s Australian
"‘Dad, we had it wrong all this time. TV is meant to be horizontal’"
Best laugh all day.
Binary
"For the rest of this season? Most likely (dont wanna buy more tracks… matter fact, just dont wanna learn more new ones)"
Do you have gloves? I feel like a fucking idiot wearing them but they do wonders
![gif](giphy|3o6ZsYzuLyRfSGX4f6|downsized)
Reach up and pull those belts tight one last time!
"https://preview.redd.it/bqbysc3avgec1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ae871edacce5de89116f31b0fdcec5aeb968341

I will not repent!!!"
i just touched a curb going downhill and sideways and died going 150 mph in the lmp2 so yea
This is hilarious why are people down voting it lol
'i always wondered how they filmed movies without the actors falling'
"I’ve tried racing gloves several times, I don’t really care how I look as I’m already sitting in a sim rig with a VR headset on… can’t get worse than that 🤣

But each time I keep going back to racing without gloves. Somehow I prefer the feel of the wheel and buttons in my hands over gloves. Maybe it’s because I am racing in VR and therefore the feel of the buttons is important to me?  

Am I missing out on something by not using gloves? I don’t have a strong direct drive wheel, just a TS-XW."
Don’t feel like an idiot. I go to a local sim place for their league night and half the people wear gloves.
well i guess i need to buy some
"Those aren't curbs, they're short walls. I don't know of any other track where curbs can completely ruin your race (let alone lap)."
You can 50:50 grind those curbs like skateboard in LMDH. Realised the lines I take in a GT3 don’t work so much for the prototypes.
I didn’t need them until I upgraded to a direct drive. You end up griping the wheel super hard and that’s the exact opposite of what you want to do (for your health and lap times).
"It’s definitely bad form to race the leaders in an oval race without cautions but also…if you’re doing a superspeedway race without cautions, you’re gonna deal with nonsense."
"No idea, but it's frustrating to have to lose pace while waiting for an opportunity to get by them without getting taken out."
"In draft masters there are a few dynamics happening that might explain the “why”
1) Lapped cars are still racing other lapped cars. Letting the leaders by often lets other lapped cars by as well. 
2) If you let the leaders by you might lose draft and get caught by other lapped cars and lose more spots.
3) There is a high probability that the guy who wiped you out earlier is in
that pack, you don’t want to be behind him, and you certainly don’t feel bad being “in the way”

Not saying these are acceptable reasons to be in the way, but they are certainly explanations.  Personally, I prefer to let the pack by and then slot in behind. A pack all in one line towing you can often help you get an extra spot or two by catching other lapped cars."
I can only assume it's really thick people who don't use a relative or standings overlay and think any car they see must be raced x 100.
"Draft Masters is the series set up to catch all the people who aren't smart enough to do things like brake or lift off the throttle during races and practice sessions. 

You're basically asking why people in the idiot trap are acting like idiots."
"That’s a 2 part question. 1) why race the leaders? There are times when I’m way behind because I’ve been in the pits too long but I know if I can get the driver in front I go from negative ST to positive. 2) Despite #1, don’t be the guy to take out the leaders."
"if I get wrecked and come out laps down I just try and hop in a draft. if they're a lap ahead of me I just try and tow behind them without changing the outcome. I would bump if asked but otherwise just chill let other lead lappers get in front to actually race the pack. does this sound acceptable, very unfirmiliar with oval. If I have no draft I just hold my lane and let the leaders fly by"
"Draftmasters is just crazy. People treat it like the Carb Cup, even though it's ranked.

In the regular Nascar series events, I find the far more common problem is the jack holes screaming about lappers not pulling over for them, even when the lappers aren't doing anything wrong. Guys who are fighting to keep their lap or lucky dog position, still capable of keeping pace with the leaders, and getting screamed at because they dare exist in the ~~godking~~ leader's relative."
"Had this happen last night. One lap to go, I’m in P1 and some guy comes out of the pit and cuts me off turn 1 and had to slam the brakes. Tried getting around him but he kept blocking me even though he was slow as shit. My 3 second lead slowly vanished and P2 car was on my ass on the last turn, which I got cut off again and had to brake hard…P2 guy ended up hitting me and spinning out. I still ended up with the win…but I just don’t get it….You’re multiple laps down at the end of the race and you literally just ruined the race for people fighting for the podium. It was a super dick move."
"Honestly in my experience there’s only two types of people. 

Those who do as you and I do when we’re laps down, move out do the way to let the leaders have there battle, without being ruined by people who’ve got unlucky in the race and are out of contention. Which I always think is the correct way to race. 

Then there are those who think that even though they are laps down and not in the fight for the lead that they want to race people. These people have no honour and probs have a bad case of main character syndrome! It would be for the best if they went back to AI races!"
Racing is just fun. They do not want drive laps alone.
Not really familiar with Iracing Oval's but from what I've seen from Nascar it seems that It is the lapped car's prerogative to remain on the lead lap/their current lap as especially in superspeed ways cautions are all but a certainty and the lucky dog exists
"I don't know your situation, but often in oval people pits and change tyres, maybe he was 2 seconds/lap faster than you and wanted to unlap himself, that is totally fine.

Maybe he just made a mistake but it's fine to unlap from the leaders if you have fresher rubber"
"You don't have to stop fighting for your own position when the leader catches up with you. It sucks being the leader but I guess it's part of the oval game.

Also, if you loose the draft on the guy in front of you, but the leader appears behind you, you can use the leaders draft to get back to the first guy.

In all those situations you still should be cautious and as safe as possible, but it's a rookie series and people are mostly amateurs, so undesired results are expected."
"Unless it's a green flag pit cycle or the race has yellows, there's no reason to race with the leaders."
"It happens a lot unfortunately, when I’m a lapper I just sit behind the leaders and mind my business, but some people will try to race as if they’re racing for the win."
"Draft Masters should be renamed to Draft Idiots.


It would represent the nature of the series a lot more."
"Are they actually defending or just trying to keep racing? Sometimes people lap me but end up slowing down/make a mistake/ or whatever, the lapped car isn't obliged to wait for you. Just because you're faster doesn't mean they stop racing to catch cars ahead. Sometimes swapping track position with a lead car happens"
"Are you angry someone raced the leaders, or that someone took someone out?

Unless the rules say you have to jump out the way (which I don't think they do), then you can race whoever you want.

Taking someone out is a dick move, but isn't limited to just people being lapped."
"I don't race oval, but I have had situations in road where I was taken out when I was toward the front, then spent the race catching another back marker, just to catch the race leader who is 30 seconds ahead of P2 and in no particular hurry. In that case, I'm going to pass the leader and try to save my iRating by catching the guy ahead. I'm also not going to feel bad about it if P1 starts crying on radio, lol."
Draft masters is the biggest collection of idiots on iRacing.
"I assume you are sub 2k irating ... so correct me if I am wrong.
fields of sub 2k irating are awful. 

You are racing at a Super Speedway and expect good racing, even in the A class iracing series at splits above 2/3k at tracks like Daytona and Talladega there will be trash who cause wrecks. 

It is also a product of that type of racing ... they want the field to run as close as possible for as long as possible, so wrecks happen often. 

All this to say go race ARCA/Xfinity/Cup Series/Indy if you want something other than pack racing that ends up in wrecks."
"Generally speaking those people aren’t “racing” you, they just don’t have the control and understanding to not be in the way"
"It depends entirely on the circumstances, in oval it's definitely bad form but in road it's totally fair game imo so long as you're not dove bombing.

Our car in the Daytona 24 was fast enough to win our split, but podium in a worst-case. My wheel cut off mid-stint for 15 seconds or so causing absolute mayhem to our car causing us to go multiple laps down. I'm absolutely passing the car running P4 who is less laps down than me and 0.5s/lap slower than me to make up ground. No amount of flashing headlights is making me lay over for that"
Because it’s a race?
"Happens in road a lot as well, it’s just bruised egos and selfishness, literally no other reason."
"The tradeoff with superspeedways is that they're easy and fun but also attract less experienced drivers. Which is fine, we've all gotta start somewhere. Try racing the short/mid size ovals and you should notice an improvement in that regard."
I think the person who took you out made a post here about the experience and how much he regretted it lol
"Yeah it happens. Happened to me in my first rod endurance race. Guy the quailed first had an incident lap 1, pitted then came out right in between me and P2, then proceeded to race me even though he was slower and we lost contact with p2. So annoying"
I let them pass
"Same on road series. I can totally understand they want to keep up the pace to catch up to the people they can realistically fight with, but if you're two laps down on me, please, just let me pass. I never do crazy moves on lapped cars because if I was to trust them and they didn't act accordignly I don't really want to lose the race because of a car that isn't really fighting for much.   
When I happen to be killed at the start of the race and am a lap down after getting out of the pits, sometimes I will catch up to people who lapped me and sometimes I struggle because I clearly have better pace and I have to be careful not to be brake tested. But I'm not gonna be this guy who races them for literally no possible benefits."
"No idea. Loses everyone time, nobody benefits from it. The only reason I could see making sense, and it's super specific and still a dick move, is if it's towards the end of a season in a league with points and one of the top 2 crashes and is being lapped so they fight the leader to prevent them from getting so many points. Otherwise you're better off letting the leader through and drafting."
"People are selfish.  There are many that refuse to use the relative and have the mentality they are simply there to fight every car, because that's racin' to them, if you've been here long I'm sure you've seen the comments of people admitting fight every single car they can.  Zero situational awareness or respect for others time and experiences."
"Draft masters isn’t exactly a high skill race. It’s basically the carb cup drivers w irating and sr involved. Personally I’d avoid it if you want good racing. 

Especially on super speedways, fighting leaders or blocking them is a recipe for disaster. In real life these guys will move way out of the way. 

On shorter tracks like intermediate and below, guys will fight to stay on the lead lap hard against leaders. But if they’re laps down that doesn’t make much sense."
Stop racing draft masters
"To be frank, I'd rather let them by and follow/watch them, learn why they lapped me; at least then I'm only binning myself, not them with me, while I'm forced to try to keep up."
"Had two lapped cars take out the guy in front of me (4th place) on the final lap/turn of Daytona Draft Masters last week. Spun him out right into the pits where he drove through, and the program put him a whole lap down for his final position. They were driving erratic next to us for three or four laps before that."
"Had this happen in the Vee’s at laguna seca. Guy in last place exits the pits in front of me(currently in 1st by a good margin). Proceeds to jam up every single corner, and when I pass, constant dive bombs on every corner. Brought my lead down from like 7 seconds to within 3. I kept telling the kid in chat to move aside and stop racing the leader when they’re in literally last place. The guy in 2nd didn’t see a problem with it as he was gaining on me rapidly because of it. It’s just bad racing."
Selection bias: many are laps behind due to poor racecraft/lack of education on unofficial rules.
"Wondering the same thing yesterday in indycar. Coming out of a caution with 15 laps left the guy dead last and several laps down was behind me in first place and another guy in 2nd. But he was on fresher tires. 

He passed second causing huge aero wash and giving me a 3 second lead. But then he passed me and cut my nose off and taking away all my air so I scraped the wall. 

Held onto the lead but got cheated out of a battle with second and caused a lot of unnecessary stress."
"They don't, generally, but it happens more often in the basement splits and on shorter tracks, since the tracks often are quite short, there is less inclination to give way since less is needed to win back ground on the leaders.

Either way, it is up to the leader to pass safely.  But it annoys me as much as the next man.

(And the Draft master races are magnets for idiots.)"
because basically everybody on iracing is ross chastain
"I believe in oval racing the lapped cars are not obligated to move aside and let you by, like in F1. I agree is annoying, but that’s how it goes."
"I don't race the leader, I follow so I can learn a thing or two. I'm dead last because I suck, you're far ahead because you know something I don't. Let me ghost your corners lol"
"If they are in a close fight with someone fair enough, why should they lose time to let you by? This ain't F1 rules. However if they are in no battle it's just bad manners, rude even! 
I blame the parents..."
Because they dumbasses?
"Not me. I got lapped twice last night and very respectfully and carefully gave way lol.

Desperately needed that last .04 SR

Wasn’t about to take an off track or crash being dumb."
It's when 2 lapped cars are racing for the lucky dog and find themselves both in the mix with the front runners. That's when it gets hairy.
"In a recent stream, I should’ve had a 3rd place finish on my first day racing Xfinity and then a lapped car took me out on the last lap. It was quite the bummer. I have no idea why they feel the need to race people on the lead lap, but it’s super frustrating"
"Need more information. Are there other lapped cars nearby they could be racing against? Will you lapping them take them off the lead lap? 

Lapped cars have a right to race other lapped cars and people have a right to try to stay on the lead lap. Other than that, there's really no reason to not give way."
"Because some people really die on the hill that ""blue flags are informational only"" and ignore the part that facilitating a safe pass is ""STRONGLY recommended"" by the iRacing sporting code. They think that's a free pass to be a complete dick whenever they get blue flag."
"Kind of depends on the situation IMO, i don't race ovals often, but for example if I'm in a road race, and I'm a lap down because I'm slower than the rest of the field, at this point I'm just going to let people go, but if I'm down a lap because I got smashed out lap 1 and had to call a tow, why shouldn't I be allowed to push hard and try to claw back as much as I can?"
"What do you mean? The people that do this clearly have a valid point when they tell you “Well if you’re faster than me, just pass me”

/s

Fuck those pricks"
"I like dirt stock, and for me (still rookie), i try to stay out of leaders line on turns and let them fly past. Sadly, theres the rookies that dont understand that. 
Personally i like to voice where on the track ill go so they can know ill let them by"
Lapped cars are only required to hold their line.  There is no obligation to move aside.  It’s the classy thing to do but not a must.
"All you have to do is move up, its such a simple thought process but people stay low, have the forearm strength of a toddler, can't hold their line and cause a lead lap crash because they just wont move.

e: downvote all you want, you're a lapped car going almost 6-7 seconds under pace with a large pack coming and your thought process is to remain in the way."
"On the other side of the story I recently limped around with damage (some top speed only, only lost out on the straights) and idiot in the lead had to overtake me through the Esses at Road Atlanta. Sheer luck we both made it out the other end unscathed.

Sometimes it's necessary to eek out all the pace you have just to make sure you don't have some dipshit divebombing in the most dangerous places because they think a lap up gives them the right to all the track."
"People are so hyper focused on their race and they feel like their better position entitles them to clear track.

It doesn't work that way. That person running in 10th 2 seconds away and gaining on 9th doesn't and shouldn't have to move over to let a lower pos by. That lower pos should be able to setup a pass and go. I'm not saying they should be defending, but they shouldn't just be altering their race because they're being lapped.

I get there are a lot of times it's better to let someone around. But it's not an always rule, everyone has their own race to run.

Can't speak too much to ovals it's easier to let people by there but at the same time you can't break your draft or your race"
"I race in VR and used to disable every single overlay to get as ""pure"" an experience as possible, and even I've had to concede on the relative overlay. Even using CrewChief the call outs just aren't consistent enough.

If for no other reason, it's a godsend for rejoining on a blind bend."
Thats my thought. I have an overlay and my dash for ahead and behind. If they are laps down and being weird i try to avoid and if its for position i race
Even top splits for DM can be absolutely terrible too. You have people who are 4k+ who didn't get there after DM became a thing but will still do the most brain dead stuff.
This.  In Draft Masters people do bonehead things just to do bonehead things.
"It makes no sense to me who the audience is for draft masters…. No cautions, short race, D class, and all your SR and IR on the line."
"I was 4th but only 2 sec behind the leader in a race. We were in a great battle. Came up on 15th. First thru third make it though on the straight I didn't. I figure I'll let the corner happen then pass on the next straight. I pass and start catching up. Now out of nowhere p15 lap traffic decides to dive bomb me. Now I have to drive defensive to keep those moves out. I lost so much time battling that guy I was 7 sec off when I finally was able to break away. 

Good news is I finished P2 because 1/2 had a collision but it would have been nice to be up there"
The Draft Masters series has no cautions or lucky dogs.
"OP said Draft Masters.  Nobody is going significantly faster than the leaders, and there aren't any caution flags, so keeping yourself from falling yet another lap down is relatively pointless.  Let the leaders by and try to hold onto the draft they create, and then try to get by any other drivers on the same lap as you."
ain't no tires on iracing gonna make you faster than the drafting leaders in draft masters
"OMG LOL.  This was my comment and then I saw this guy actually proves my point:

"" I can only assume it's really thick people who don't use a relative or standings overlay and think any car they see must be raced x 100."""
"I've found that a lot of those ""back markers ruined my race"" are caused by leaders crashing because they assumed others would move out of the way, and they didn't have the skills to overtake a passive opponent. Quite literally hubris causing their fall."
I hope if you ever take the lead of a race that you experience a selfish back marker.
Do you not realise how entitled you sound? Ironic that you mention ego as one of the reasons.
No he was a single car 2 laps behind lol
Well this guy was on fresh tyres and battling in the middle the accident happened because he pushed threw the middle making it 3 wide and collided with the race leader lol
"You weren't downvoted because you're wrong, you were downvoted because you aren't really replying to anything in the comment above yours while also being a dick about it."
"I had some person, lap leader mind you, push me off the track in a road race. Collided with the guardrail at speed, and had 35 minutes of repair required, putting me out for the rest of the race.

I said ""thanks"" using the F button hotkey. He replied ""don't camp on the racing line"". I replied that racing code dictates a person being lapped drive predicably and maintain a line to allow leaders to pass. 

Was my first ever protest, absolutely pissed me off. I knew I was back, but I was clean that race to that point, and was simply trying to finish and get to the next session. I followed all the rules and had the session ruined because of a bully."
"True. I like mixed series racing, but there are definitely some assholes that think slower cars need to give way."
"That really annoys me too lol.

Blue flag doesn’t mean I have to pull off into the grass. I’m very diligent about being predictable and letting someone past me as quickly as it is safely possible.

But sometimes someone comes flying up and it’s like they can’t conceive that there’s someone in their racing line lol."
Same! I wanted to be completely immersed and ended up having to bring back the relative box. Crew chief would give the time to the car behind but wouldn't say it enough or when I needed it most.
"Ah i see, sounds like chaos. As others have stated though in Iracing blue flag is just information, asshole move yes, legal also yes"
Can you explain to me why not?
"People think iRacing follows F1 rules for whatever bizzare reason, constantly shouting “read the sporting code” when the sporting code specifically states the blue fag is informative that faster cars are approaching, that’s literally all their is to it. No debate to be had. Just because you’re lapped doesnt mean you have to let everyone pass you lmao, thankyou for speaking common sense"
"Yep. Had this happen to me more times than I can count. Especially at superspeedways. 

Best one was Talladega in Xfinity. Green flag pit cycles, I come out with no draft help. Fall a lap down. I'm chasing a guy down to draft with as the leaders start catching up. I'm just barely snagging draft on the guy ahead and stay planted on the bottom line. High line gives room, leader of bottom line just sticks to the bottom and drives right into me then starts screaming about me being in his way."
"And can you explain why they are selfish? What if said back marker quali’d on pole but got shunted off in T1? The fastest man on the grid perhaps. Does that mean he should just quit the race and leave? Fucking get a grip man it’s a game, the rules don’t say anywhere you have to pull over and let “unlapped” cars past."
"It’s entitled to expect a back marker to act sensibly and not ruin the leaders race? You’re right that mad thing to expect.

Regardless of you got there, you’re at the back. Behave yourself."
"The comment isn't being a dick to the guy above. Its a general statement stating its so easy to just move and super speedways w/o cautions don't have to be like that. 

So I was in fact replaying to something in the comment I replied toward. Driving super speedways is literally incredibly easy and the fact people can't hold their lines is ridiculous."
"You did the right thing. ""Camping the racing line"" is the same thing as ""holding your line"". These monkeys are just repeating what they've been told and don't want to share the playground."
"They always say to get off the racing line too. Which way, guy? Left, or right? Theres a million ways i can get out of the way but only 1 racing line and if you think you’re hot shit you should easily pass me"
"Luckily I'm not a big fan of open wheelers or prototypes, which means I can put the relative overlay on the center console and trick myself into thinking I have a Tesla tablet in the car."
Go read the sporting code you absolute banana.
"Even if you are behind, you have a race to do and even if I'm behind a lap or 2 and have a chance to gain a position I won't be slowing down for the leaders, I'll try to ease the pass if they are faster, because sometimes people at the front aren't faster."
"It’s irrelevant how they got to the back. If I’m at the back, I act like how I’d want others to act in that situation. End of the days it’s about respect. This is the issue with iRacing not being able to police every race so they’re left it up to personal decency when it comes to lapped traffic, you get selfish morons thinking of no one but themselves."
"This is the EXACT type of entitlement I’m talking about, being first, gives you no benefit over being last. You get no special treatment. Everyone is, wait for it you’re gonna love this, racing… & just to add, the race isn’t over until the chequered flag where anything can happen, last can end up first vice versa. We’re not in a hot lap competition mate, one more time for the illiterate. ITS A RACE."
I didn't say it was being a dick to the guy above.  It was being a dick in general.
"Yep and that's exactly the opposite of what should be done.  Slower car stays on the line, faster cars figure out how to get by safely."
Still not sure what you’re referring to? Hopefully not the informative blue fag. Feel free to point me to the right place in the sporting code
"Finally, a logical & more importantly, correct answer"
"Can you please show me a rule where it says lapped traffic must let other cars pass. I’ll be waiting. I’m sure it should be nice and clear, black & white in the sporting code?"
"If you’re a lap down you’re literally not racing them, hilarious you can’t get your head round that.

I’m not arguing with a hateful moron any longer. Your headspace is toxic."
Thin skin if you think thats being a dick.
"It´s called racing etiquette, something you clearly dont have...

When you´re lapped, do everyone a favour and MOVE OUT OF THE DAMN WAY! Nobody said you´ve gotta come to a stop and let them past, but you can lift off throttle slightly on a straight and give them enough room to pass."
"Again, they can’t put it in the sporting code as it’ll be impossible to police all those instances. So again it’s about decency which is an impossible expectation for some selfish morons out there.

Yes you can act selfishly and annoy everyone because the sporting code technically allows it but it’s a very hateful headspace to be in."
"So everyone a lap down should leave the race? What if multiple people are a lap down, they’re racing each other for position no? Please, read the description of the blue flag with yellow diag and tell me what it says. Moron mate honestly"
"That’s the thing mate, you can’t dispute fact. No matter how toxic or hateful it seems lmao, soft dude"
"But also the comment was about a lapped car staying in/with the lead pack, not about approaching slower lapped traffic and the dance that it can create."
"You’ve provided no reason as to why, etiquette and rules are two different things."
"It's all situational. There's no requirement to race the leader who is lapping me any differently than someone trying to pass me for position.

If the leader has a car trailing behind them that I am directly racing for position, then not defending against the leader can cost me that position if their pass costs me time on a critical corner. If I want to be courteous to the leader while also trying to maintain that position, I can let them by at a time that's more opportune for me while costing them only a small amount of time.

Think of Road Atlanta's Turn 7. If the leader passes me going into that corner then I will have a terrible exit going all the way down that straight to Turn 10. Where I could defend the corner, then let them by on the straight while trying not to lose a position to the next car."
Okay. Let’s remove iRacing & the sporting code. What about the IRL series that follow the exact rule I’m talking about? Entitled wiener mate that’s all you are.
Its almost if conversations can span into other talking points.
[removed]
I feel like your reading comprehension needs major work. I was complaining about lapped cars - not the other way around. Ask for a refund on what ever education you spent money on.
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
At least he tried to bail. This week in LMP2 is gonna be interesting.
Yes im glad he did instead of locked upp and took us both out or just punted me off.
"Without knowing any details, because you didnt include any, You're probably getting a poor exit out of the corners immediately before straights. 

Slow in, fast out. Watch track guides. Practice practice practice."
It is 100% about your cornering whether you think it is or not.
"It’s hard to learn anything when you start by dismissing what is probably the root of your problem. If others take the corner much better, leaving it with much higher exit speed, they will go faster throughout the straight that follows and therefore gain on you."
"most likely because your exit out of the corner before the straight wasn't as good as everyone else. watch this vid: [https://youtu.be/6-sGV2XXUeU](https://youtu.be/6-sGV2XXUeU)  


also make sure your throttle is at 100% when you depress the pedal fully"
Okay then its a consensus its my shitty cornering methods! I will get back to work thank you all for replying
"What helped me a lot was finding track guide to show a fast lap, braking markers, and what gear to be in."
They’re catching you on straights most likely bc they’re on the throttle faster and carry more speed through their corners
"Something else to consider is turning on the input telemetry so you can be sure you’re actually at 100% throttle. I made some adjustments to my pedals once and it took me a while to figure out that I was constantly on the brakes at 10% even with my foot off. Your problem is likely your exits but it doesn’t hurt to check anyways!

Edit: also checkout Garage61!! Amazing for understanding where you’re slow"
"If you're in an open series, the other cars could be running less wing (depending on the car) and therefore have more straight line speed. Or, they could have gotten a better exit in the previous corner and carried the advantage down the straight."
I recommend spectating. Join a practice session and just shift to someone with good lap times. Change the camera to cockpit and observe.
Corner exit speed is your issue
Just check your not accidentally leaning on the brake while your accelerating.  Maybe set-up a dead zone.  You can set-up dead zones even just using the iRacing ui.
Watch track guides on YouTube and see what they are doing differently from yourself. You can also get a coach for an hour or so and have them walk you through what they think would help you out.
Telemetry will tell you what faster people are doing different from you. Garage61 is awesome and free. Worth supporting if you can afford! 
"You answered your own question. If you are slower in the proceeding corner, you are going to be slower on the straight. There are also techniques you can use on a straight, don't discount that. "
They likely have more cornering speed leading go more.straightline speed and/or are drafting. Without more details it's hard to say for certain. Keep practicing and observing others as they go past and you'll get better.
"They're gaining on you because they're exiting the corner at a higher speed.

The most important thing in racing is your exit speed as it helps you carry speed on the straights and that's where you'll find massive gains."
Poor exit
"There isn’t enough information in this post to know for sure what’s happening in your case. But here are the most common reasons:

1. You’re getting bad corner exits, or are too slow through the corners (or both). By starting the straight at a lower speed, you’ll be at a disadvantage the entire time. 

2. They have a slipstream, they’ll always be faster if they’re right behind you. 

3. Your pedals aren’t properly calibrated and you aren’t actually outputting 100% throttle. 

3 is worth double checking, but it’s likely a combination of 1 and 2."
"If they are 2+ seconds behind and gaining on a. Straight it’s because you got a Poorer exit. 

If they are within a second it’s because they have your draft. Less air resistance on the trailing car allowing them to go faster in the wake you create out front."
"You don't say what series so it's tough to be specific but there is a lot of good advice within the comments already.   

Track guides.  Check out TDI99 on YT and Discord.  Mr T has done a tonne of guides and there is a growing community of people willing to help. 

Slow in fast out.  Don't over drive.   

Is there a fixed series so you can compare yourself without the complications of setup.   I often do both open and fixed for the same car/track combo as there are a few of those around.

Garage 61 to compare telemetry.

How do your hot laps compare to your race laps.  Is this a race craft and anxiety issue. 

With any of these things you are not alone."
Could it be related to shifting? Like shifting up too early or too late? Just a thought
"Could be;

1. Hardware issue where your brake pedal is slightly on, your throttle is slightly off, or your clutch is jittering. Check your inputs HUD while test driving. 

.
2. Car setup. Test in fixed setup racing.

.
3. And most likely. Getting corners right gives you better speed down the proceeding straight. Everything else being equal, one person nails corner exit and one doesn't the nailer will catch the other down the straight. Test in time trails with a downloaded ghost.


It is almost certainly number 3"
It's called draft
"Sorry, I've been doing MX5 at Oulton Park Circuit rookie circuit. I have in fact gotten 1.5 sec faster just since you all made suggestions. So I have to agree its my cornering that is the problem. But I will look at everything you guys suggested!"
"Yeah we need details. 

OP, what class are you taking about. If you’ve now got your d licence and your going a racing classes that don’t have multiple splits you may be encountering some seriously fast drivers who are going to make anyone with 1 month experience look slow. It would be the equivalent of my going down to my local basketball court and joining in a game with a bunch of NBA players. I’d look stupid. 

This is a platform where it’s not uncommon to have a professional race car driver in your lobby, up to the level of 3 x and current f1 world champion. 

You may need to rethink what you’re doing and go race somewhere where you can race at your level. 

In the mean time check your he following in this order 

Driving:
- too into the corner fast in for your skill level
- lines are poor, making the corners too tight
- Too late on the throttle exiting-corner
- dragging brakes on straight
- dragging throttle through corner
- inputting both pedals confusing the car


Technical 
- throttle not going to 100%
- brake not releasing fully

Setting dead zones may cure the problems above but it definitely sounds like a skill issue.

My advice is to post a hot lap here of the track and car you’re currently doing and we can get a better understanding of your issues."
"Just want to get more eyes on this comment, this is the video I like to share. The one that made a lot of connections in my brain click."
Taking a look thank you
This is good advice if you know what you're looking for. If you don't know what to look for and at you're just along for a ride.
Yeah sorry I've been doing the  Oulton Park Circuit MX5 rookie league. I like the slow in fast out advise I will remember that. My hot laps are always 1-2 sec faster than a race so yes I think some anxiety there!
Also make sure the brake pedal is not being pressed when not pressed I’ve had issues where out of nowhere people would gain on me and I’d be a second or 2 slower than a normal lap. The worst part is I couldn’t tell until the race when I was running with other cars. Before that I just thought I was running slow compared to my previous lap times.
That reminds me of my first liveries I did of the Hard Mtn Dew flavors on the 86!

Nice!
Bro I just came to post this 😂😂😂 still no clue how I missed this
I'm still watching it in amazement.
Sweet username dude.
It’s like looking in a mirror
"What chipset are you using? I was researching VR a while back and saw some issues with X570 motherboards in combination with the Reverb G2. It was over a year ago now, so the situation may have changed, but it's worth looking into"
you will be fine. upgrade your GPU first if you ever upgrade.  you will be playing on decently low settings FYI.
It'll work but won't look very pretty.
Yes but get openxr toolkit and use fixed foveated rendering. You wont notice it during racing at all and it gives you a ton of fps.
"Thanks for the answers. I’ve asked my friend to look at upgrading what I’ve got, should be able to upgrade for £600-£700"
"I’ve literally no idea. Is there a way to find out? What about the other specs, could it work? It works fine with my wide curved screen"
this was resolved like a while ago. within 1 year of x570 being released. a bios update solved it. its not a concern now.
"it's not a problem. HP put out a revised cable that has a power connector and it resolved the issue. 

Have used a G2 on a x570 board for 18 months now without issue. "
HP also dropped a new cable too which solved other AMD issues
the chipset issues and the cable issues presented differently though. Always update bios in these cases before replacing the cable. the cable would just break internally after some use.
"This type of uploading should be protested

But, yes, protest that clown"
"Can you zoom out a little next time

Need to be sure there’s no dolphins in that lake"
100%. He crossed the track to rejoin. And it even looks like he was waiting for someone so he could wreck this person
This video format should be protested
"I'm the one who got wrecked. 

The other guy came off the grass, across the track, caused a wreck and then disconnected from the race."
"My apologies for the crappy video.

I clicked the wrong file to upload."
"Yes. Absolutely. 

It’s an utter lack of situational awareness. He’s in his own world. A friendly but firm email from iRacing can hopefully get him to think more critically in the future. If it doesn’t; then the next time he’s protested for it, it’ll be a ban."
Yes.
When to protest: When the sporting code is violated.
Unsafe rejoin. Yes
Always protest unsafe rejoins. They are one incident that is 100% on them 100% selfish and is 100% avoidable
Yes
"What is this? A replay for ants!? It needs to be at least twice as big!

Seriously though, think of your audience, most people are viewing on phones so make sure it's nice and clear, think chase cam. And if it's a bit dicey, put in their POV.

But yes, protest that, it won't be a suspension but most likely a warning/telling off from iRacing for driving like an idiot."
"Cars?  Check.  
Track?  Check.   
Telescope?   Ah, shit."

I agree. That car ran right into the yellow one. Definitely report that fool. /s
What in the aspect ratio is this?!
"This happened to me on the same corner today. I figured… it’s rookies, guy probably just didn’t have control coming back on. 

Maybe I should’ve protested. Ruined my race obviously"
"If you have to ask yourself the question, it's mostly a ""yes""."
ban and thats it
"We get it, you have triples. No need to flex by showing us this video format."
"Hahahaha. It takes a lot for me to literally LOL at a Reddit comment, but you've succeeded."
This an awesome series and gives you the chance to race with people who have real world experience on track racing against other people. Our team started off doing these sim races in this league 5 years ago which helped launch our team into real racing.
Someone made our actual Champcar's paint (2006 miata) for us in iRacing so it'd be perfect haha.
"Oh not *that* Champ Car. Damn. One day we'll get those in a game. I so badly want to blast around in Paul Tracy's Team Green car.

edit: Hell yeah VRC has a ""Formula NA 1999"" which is CART/Champ/Indy!"
"Same goes for the guys at HughJass. We're looking forward to some fresh challengers. 

For those wondering, we have a pretty widely distributed grid - Usually anywhere from 1500 to 6000 iRating. There's always someone to race with, and we have prizes for winners and draws for those who just show up."
Love it! Good liveries get extra camera time :)
"Don't worry, ChampCar licensed the name a while back (the org was originally called ""ChumpCar""). Our real world cars are still way slower, heavier and cheaper than the old ChampCars though!"
"Slower, heavier, and cheaper means better racing!"
"Rather than trying to “learn” the track, treat the track like a mountain road, slowdown more than you think going into corners and accelerate out. 

I took this advice and understood the track way more had I tried learning it like every other track (I’m usually really good at learning tracks, but Nurburgring pissed me off)."
"I learned it in three hours between monday and yesterday (I have only memorized the track, I'm not fast and consistant enough to go on officials yet). I have used the active reset a lot once I compleated the first 2 or 3 slow paced laps in order to learn the limits of some turns. I think it is super usefull, at least for me, to divide the track on sectors of 1m in your head and limit test it, resetting every time you go off track or crash, or feeling that you can push more in some turn.

Currently I'm on 7:45s with the GTP, so I need these last 15 seconds to be competitive on IMSA. Hopefully I will be able to race at Nords this weekend!

I wanted to try with guides but honestly I find it a little boring this way."
I like this guide: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDgPIzXADRz4AjyqgocDeglVWF2MEezPU](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDgPIzXADRz4AjyqgocDeglVWF2MEezPU)
"Start with a slow car and move upp, its a whole different beast to try and tame with increase in power and downforce. But learning the track in a Clio got me faster around it in a Prototype."
"As others have pointed out:

\- take a slower car or drive slowly. Repetition is the key.

\- break the Ring up in different sectors. start from the beginning and memorise the first sector. Breaking points, etc. then next sector. You drive the entire track each time, but focus on one part of the track at a time.

\- youtube guides, real POV from races help alot also.

It just takes longer due to the length."
"Nothing beats driving it, in theory when it comes up in your series you have the week to learn and race on it, after a couple of races you will learn it quickly 

Do the standalone quali session, 20 mins of you alone on the track and you’ll also gain some safety rating(if you keep it on track)"
"If you reset your car on the ring, instead of going straight to the pits, it repairs your car and sends you back to the last little pull off spot. Not sure if it lines up with sectors but it’s absolutely a great way to learn a few corners at a time."
((MX-5) + 2(hour) = Learn) * (20) = mastery
"Your best chance is racing the ring meister series this week. It’s using the Pontiac Solstice which is the slowest car on iracing, so you’ll have an easier time memorizing"
"Take the solstice or gr86 and use acrive reset. 
I would recommend 30sec intervals"
"Pick a car you enjoy to drive that doesn’t kill you in an instant. 

And just take a few laps just driving, you will start recognize sectors a few laps in. Nords works fairly good per sector at first since per sector the corners can be pretty simular speedwise. 

Once you recognize where you actually are watch a few lap guides and start working on some real pace 

Run a few ringmeisters if you have the car for it"
Do solo Test Drive and assign buttons for Active Reset and then go practice a sequence of corners at a time before moving along to another section 👍👍
"Not learnt it fully yet, but I use time trials to give me an incentive to go slower - aka do not crash and lose SR. You usually get 3 - 4 laps and I ty to increase my speed on each one. Its really interesting how much more confident you are on lap 3 or 4 compared with lap 1."
"Exactly how I approached the track. Until you can just straight up memorize the track just remember the general idea and gears that are good in areas. Then later you'll end up with spaces you remember on your own terms like the two harsh downhills into the one spectator area that has two 90's. That goes into a long section that you can be on throttle a lot and leads into the first carousel. 

The track tries to defy you learning it because there are parts that are very similar and if you miss something you'll suddenly think you're somewhere else on the track when you're first going through it. Just experience it and don't crash out. It's the most endurance like experience in the regular series tracks."
">Currently I'm on 7:45s with the GPT

I was trying to figure out how you got a chatbot to do a sub 8 minute ring lap"
This looks awesome. I'll definelty spend some time watching these thanks!
">ours between monday and yesterday (I have only memorized the track, I'm not fast and consistant enough to go on officials yet). I have used the active reset a lot once I compleated the first 2 or 3 slow paced laps in order to learn the limits of some turns. I think it is super usefull, at least for me, to d

It annoys me so much how dark those videos are."
I think that's going to be my approach. My end goal is to do it in the lmp3 but ill start learning it with something much slower
"A good tip to add onto this, turn off at the last section of the GP circuit onto the hairpin and reset your car in order to skip the outlap if you just want to see your lap times without an extra 8 or so minutes"
"Thanks for notice it, I use the word GPT a lot and my keyboard auto corrected it hahaha"
I learned it playing gran Turismo decades ago but I didn’t really learn it until watching these…https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdvRa-hxfpNpQHyiwQAC7f1NXJPCdi3DW&si=CHCd_dtCMXaIzJ9I
I did watch the 6 videos series linked earlier and found it very helpfull. But i spent many laps in the Clio learning it to drive it irl and have raced i think 5 different classes there since without doing much more than a few practice laps to adjust braking points and corner speed.
"Similar sentiment to the guy you replied to, I learnt it by driving it and doing races in the MX-5 whenever they raced there. I think it made racing the GT3s there less of a barrier for me because I knew the track and all the corners, just had to (and still am) adjust to the faster cars."
"Stp,"
You can’t do a service in the pit & serve your penalty. It completely invalidates the whole point of a penalty.
"Stop & hold/stop & go you can do pit service during and its fine. Drive through you can't stop in the pits, but even still if you do stop in the pits anyways, you will still get service if selected, it just won't count the penalty as served. Does not explain at all why OP would have not recieved fuel when it was requested."
"I thought the point of the hold penalty is that you just have to wait until the penalty is served before the pit service starts? Otherwise if you get the penalty into the pits like I did with an empty tank, you're basically screwed(?). Please correct me if I'm wrong."
not true lol
"There are different penalties, a drive through one you  cant stop in your pitbox for but a timed one like the one for speeding you serve in your box while doing service.

Why service didnt start i dont know, happened to me during Daytona 24 att one of the stops, had to tow the car for it to start and it did tires and fuel separate so lost a lap for it. Sent in a ticket to iRacing but now answer yet."
"I could be wrong, that’s just the assumption I was under but I’d also like to say, speeding into the pits with no fuel is completely on you, I don’t see why you should be forgiven, you’d simply have to take a tow round back to the pits"
I entered the pits way too fast at Nurbur yesterday and I served my 40 sec hold penalty \_after\_ the pit service process.
"I'm not to the point of refueling or changing tires to a race but can't you set up your pit strategy like in acc? I'm just wondering, is it possible you simply had 0l of fuel before getting in the pit? I'm asking all of you!"
"But you're not forgiven though, you have to serve the penalty regardless. After you've served the penalty you should still be able to do the pit service(?). I get that you can't do pit service if you get a drive through, but this was a simple hold penalty. But maybe I did something else wrong."
"Both me and my spotter checked on inlap it was set for 75liters and tires. It didnt start refueling after i checked and unchecked the black box for service either. I was panicking and reversed in and out of box and nothing. 
Spotter said try tow and i did, car started refueling and changed tires after refuel was done so we lost a lap to that. Shame we where in P3 and finished P6 because of it."
Shiit all of this for a bug 😒
"Yeah, I think it was a bug atleast. If it was just me on I would have assumed it was just me not checking the pit service before entry and thinking i did, but since it was both me and my spotter i dont think it was just human error. It was one of many pits that race and all others worked fine so shouldnt have been any of my settings etc either."
"Next time, if you have another driver in session, have that driver hop in the car and see if it starts service."
"First, congrats on the awesome finish, that’s super cool.

Secondly, how do you get real drivers/schemes into iRacing with the AI races?"
"I created this custom set myself, not the paint schemes and driver names. But you can use trading paints, and people upload drivers paint schemes. And then other people will go and make car sets with the full field of current nascar drivers and give them their own ratings, or you can create your own car set and add all the cars you want in to it and customize the ratings yourself, sorry that might be a bit confusing but it's really not bad. I enjoy doing it the 2nd way because I can choose which paint schemes I want and the drivers I want in each car and their individual ratings."
Yeah I’ve got trading paints and am definitely familiar with iRacing but not the AI side.  Is it all done with files outside the sim or all in-sim?
I remember the days of NR2003 and downloading all the cars
"It's all in the sim, on trading paints you have to favorite the paint scheme to add it to a collection, or favorite the collection to use it iracing."
Sweet!!  Makes life pretty easy then.  I may be back with questions if I’m too dumb to figure it out 😂😂
"Yeah it does indeed compared to nr2003 haha. Yeah no problem, I'll try to answer as much as I can."
Man I wish I had the grunt to run iRacing in anything but low detail in VR.
"If you want to get rid of the blinding light, but still have HDR on for other bits  


AutoExposure=0                                  	; 0=off, 1=on  (only functions when HDR is also enabled)  


That will be in your rendererDX11Monitor.ini file"
blind by the sun and deafening by the V10 sound...what are we willing to do for this game?
"Getting to have the same experience this week in the SF23 at the Red Bull Ring. Up the hill into turn one, unable to see the 100 board due to the glare. It really is quite pretty."
Just gut my first taste of the iRacing sun at the charlotte roaval… brutal lol
I just trust it and hope 130r to not kill me in my 992
Had this at a real life track day when I hopped in for a ride along with my friend in the last session.  We came in early because we couldn't see shit around a few corners.
"And by sunset you actually mean sunrise :D

How do you guys hit the lift marker before 130R in that light? Can you reliably see the kink in the guardrails on the right at the 50m board, or do you rather eyeball whatever you can see of the apex? I’m still debating with myself what works better - one thing I won’t do is to change my config so that I don’t have to deal with the problem :)"

"Heh. And it's not like you can hold your hand up to block out the sun! :) If you haven't seen it already, humbly suggest go and watch Climb Dance - 1988 Pikes Peak Hill Climb, Ari Vatanen (in the dirt!) on YT. Awesome footage and \[mild spoiler\] him taking his hand off to block the sun towards the top of the run... ravin' mad."
Turn HDR on
Just click the HDR checkbox
I really wish we didn't have to go into the ini files to change things
"I just eyeball it, works well enough even if it's probably suboptimal an costs me a tenth per lap. I really can't see any markers at the side of the road in that glare at 250 kph."
there are no HDR VR Displays?
"Seriously, dealing with triple monitors is so annoying when you first set it up."
I mean in reality that option just shouldn't exist. Graphics settings that can give an advantage should be minimized. 
"The selectable HDR option in the right bottom of the graphic options is not ""display HDR"", it has nothing to do with the spectrum of colors your monitor can or will display aside of what it already is capable of.

You can also see this in your resolution setting; a 'normal non-HDR screen' will display your resolution as ""1920 x 1080"", a HDR native screen will be displayed as ""1920 x 1080 HDR"".

The selectable HDR option is more like ""HDR Rendering""; it will give the graphics more depth, better lightning, a better color palette in general and fancy stuff like bloom. 

It works on any screen, on non-HDR display it is just a little bit less ""fancy"", because they have a much more limited color spectrum. But the option should be enabled anyway, because it provides graphical benefit to everyone."
"I use the Quest 2 and it absolutely uses HDR… having the HDR box checked in iRacing makings a massive difference when it comes to any kind of lighting…. It especially makes brake lights wayyyyyyy easier to see and gives the sun glare just like what’s seen in the video above

It may not use it natively or whatever but it definitely makes a difference on iRacing with link cable"
Thats becouse the iracing HDR setting isnt the same HDR that displays advertise. It does similiar things but is not the same as actual display HDR and thus works on even non hdr displays
"The CPU is worth the Upgrade.  
I Upgraded from a 3900x to an 5800x3d and it was worth it.  
Iracing is very CPU heavy and profits from a high single core speed."
"5800x3d gave me rock solid FPS during D24 on my 3060Ti in VR where typically I'd have some 60FPS lows when rejoining the oval. 

Just make sure you update your bios and hope that your mobo vendor allows you to undervolt it. Pretty much all of them should be able to do -30 in Curve Optimizer.  Can get the same performance with much better thermals. "
"Just ordered a 5800x3d, coming from a 5600x I had for about two years.

As I'm still using the 2070s at the moment, I'm assuming my GPU will be my bottleneck ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)

For your setup it will be a huge improvement. Check this video:

[https://youtu.be/DseH5Ixp4f4](https://youtu.be/DseH5Ixp4f4)"
100%. Went from 3600 to 5800x3d on a rtx3080 and pretty much doubled my vr framerate. The 3d cache is insane on iracing.
"I can't comment on iRacing performance improvements specifically, as I upgraded from 3600xt to 5800x3d before I got into it. But the performance gains across all games has been very noticeable, especially with 1% lows, which makes everything far smoother.

I'm also running a RTX3080, with a single 38"" ultrawide(3840x1600 resolution), mid/high settings. I usually hover around 120-160+ FPS depending on track and amount of cars on track"
"I upgraded from a normal 5800x to the X3D and even that is a massive upgrade, especially in iRacing. iRacing loves the extra cache, so yes, I would definitely go for it again"
"Cpu for sure.  Loon up 3080ti vs 4090 for iracing to get a sense on why gpu is less important 

But the cpu...that is super important on your level. 

If you had a 2060...diff story 
3080 ok for now"
"Yes, the upgrade is huge. 

I went from 3600x to 5600x to 5800x3d and the jump is unbelievable. The CPU is still running at the very top in terms of fps so yes, go for it.  

Matter of fact the cpu upgrade was so big I haven't upgraded the GPU yet and will wait for some better deals in the future. 2080 super is still strong combined with the x3d.

You will need a very very good cpu cooler so keep that in mind."
"I'm astonished at people's FPS woes on higher end machines. I run triple ultrawides at 1440p on a 3070ti and i9 10900k and I regularly hit my frame cap of 120. High demand tracks like Daytona at night will dip it down to the occasional 85. That's at mid-high settings.

One big thing that I turn OFF is object self shadowing. And night shadows.  Those are FPS killers without a huge visual benefit.

Make sure you're not drawing more than 20 or 30 cars. That's usually a big hit too. 

Also Reflex will give you a 10-15 hit on frame rate. It technically shouldn't but it does. 

Your 3700x and 3080 should be fine to regularly get over 120 if you mess with settings a little."
"upgraded 3800x 2080S to 5800x3d and it was definitely noticeable. However, I am on a single 4k screen so it's a different story. I would say it is worth it for sure, the 5800x3d is a beast and it's relatively easy to swap a cpu out, if you're comfortable with re-installing the heat sink"
I have the same setup and I swaped to the 5800x3d and it helped alot tho I am playing in vr. I would say it's worth
God damn that might well have convinced me!
"Edit: oof just finished reading the first half, nvm haha
Damn, im with 3600xt and 2080
How much fps were u getting with 3600 and 3080?"
"Can confirm, 5800X3D made my 2080 a triple screen competitor ."
I will give these settings a go. Thank you so much for your guidance.
I have a 3080 and 5600x and run 1440p 32inch triples locked at 90. It never dips with everything on track high and everything off track turned off or low. I think it would run 120 OK. If you go slightly above that you'll be fine.
"4070 super. I used to recommend 4070ti but the super has almost as much performance for much cheaper.  Don't bother with a 4080.

If you have an am4 motherboard go with 5800x3d. Otherwise go with an am5 motherboard and 7800x3d."
7800x3d and a 4070 (super if in budget) will be perfect
"On what graphics settings? Low, mid, high, max? Anyway, RTX 4080 because of powerful GPU and Nvidia just better for triple screen. I'm not seeing AMD GPU can't, they can, but Nvidia better.

And CPU like 7800x3D, 8 cores, extra L3 cache benefits games so much, so you really hard to miss with this CPU. If we talk about new AM5 platform and your target is DDR5, but you can cut prices and go to DDR4, 5800x3D CPU and cheaper AM4 motherboard.

About RAM, take two sticks of 16GB if we talk about DDR5. If you want more RAM it's good to go in 2 sticks, not 4, because, unfortunately many memory controller in new AMD CPU can't handle 4 stick of RAM on high speed. 4 sticks make big load on memory controller. And  no matter RAM with XMP or EXPO label, DDR5 is just DDR5, if motherboard and CPU can use this RAM, so any ram will work on high speed.

Motherboard just avoid Asus, on Gamer Nexus you can watch video about stupidnes of Asus and consumer not friendlies in AM5 motherboards. They burn CPU because of wrong settings, they blame AMD, users and even give special BIOS update for solving problem but if you install it, you lose warranty and if something goes wrong after it's your problem.

And you don't need 1000usd fancy motherboard, 150usd just enough.

Don't go to ultrahigh speed SSD. They not miles away better. Companies write read and write speeds about big files, like videos, but games and app have many files with small size and big speed for big price in reality not cos this money because difference around statistics mistake. Even if you find (and they are existing SSD with high read speed for small size files, is this cost extra 100usd for 2-3 seconds quicker loading track? I think not.

My PC is Ryzen 9 7950x3D, 64GB RAM (two sticks of 32GB, CL32, 6000), AsRock Reptide B650E WiFi motherboard (If there is option to not pay extra few USD for E chipset, I will happily cut price, but I just want MB from AsRock and onboard WiFi, so I don't need to separate buy WiFi module and install it) and RTX4090."
5800x3d and 4070ti. Runs fine on medium ish settings.
"I purchased the PowerSpec G443 desktop from Micro Center last summer to power my 32"" triples. It has the i7 13700KF cpu, 4070 12GB GPU and 32 gb RAM. I max out my iRacing graphics except I turn off the crowd and I get 100 fps-150 fps. The computer is dedicated for sim racing only."
Would you be able to share a screenshot of your settings please? I have a 3080 and I'm struggling to hit 90
"I see a lot of the comments are mentioning the 7800x3d/5800x3d in terms of CPU. Are AMD CPU's the move now? (Its been so long since I've built a pc, I just remember intel chips and NVIDIA GPUs being the gold standard). I think I will probably get a 4070 or 4080 after I can see the performance comparison between the two"
"I'm old, I remember Pentium 3 and older CPU, I'm with you, all my life I used Intel CPU.

But from Ryzen times, AMD CPU really good, specially x3D. Without marketing bullshit I will try to explain you what is x3D.

So, few decades CPU have L1, L2, L3 cache, for different purposes. L3 what we need to discuss. CPU often data during work, trying to store in L3, when there not enough space, CPU store this data in miles away slower DDR4 or 5 RAM (we will not take older coz we don't use it now) or recalculate again. Both strategies need to time for waiting data and CPU not prepares new frame, or need calculations power to recalculate this data while preparing new frame.

And x3D it's just bigger L3 cache, it's additional cache for CPU, so he not spent time or power for having again that's he was have in past frame.

And as games share big amount of same data frame to frame, bigger L3 cache have massive impact on Frames Per Second in games.

So for gaming extra 100usd for 7800x3D CPU have massive positive impact on FPS while for productivity app where CPU mostly working with new data, better spend this 100usd on more cores in CPU."
Thank you for such a detailed explanation. I am now between the 5800x3D and 7800x3D.
tbh i would go for 7800x3d so you are on the AM5 platform and not stuck on AM4
"This is blatantly not your fault and nothing will happen to you for that morons shit rejoin.

Tips - ignore idiots and keep getting out there."
"If you see someone on the grass like the video thumbnail before pressing play, simply brake earlier, take it easy, watch them play bowling with the cars in front."
He screamed on for a while how his report ist going to ban me for a month at least
"Not your fault, but it was pretty easy to see how that was going to go. A car on the grass approaching a hard braking zone is not something you want to be in front of / to the outside of."
Stop racing this series this week. It’s such a shit show.
Obviously not your fault but you should have known he would come flying across the corner when he’s four wheels off on the inside.
"FYI, if someone is on the grass in a high speed part of a track followed by a heavy braking, don’t go in front of them, or to their side, it is a clear sign they don’t have control of the car and will go straight instead of braking.

No it wasn’t your fault but it was avoidable IMO, there were some signs that something was going to happen but you failed to recognize what would happen, with time you’ll get the hang of it, but as of right now learn from it and try to remember for the next time you see someone in the grass, specially before heavy braking. Keep driving safely."
"It's a rookie series. You're racing against people who may have never touched a sim. Protest and move on. Also I like how you cut your own unsafe rejoin at the end 😆

Edit: So not a rookie series. Makes what both drivers do way worse. 😆"
"you saw him go off track. and you continued on as if nothing happened. I would've slowed down and stayed behind him, that unsafe rejoin was very obvious that it was about to happen"

"Racing aside, this is reportable and protestable in itself.

2.3.1 [iRacing.com](https://iRacing.com) provides means for racers to communicate with one another before, during and after on-track sessions.

Disrespectful communications, including foul or threatening language and insults, will not be tolerated and could lead to suspension or the cancellation of the offender’s membership.

As far as the incident is concerned it seemed like the red car was not trying to rejoin safely.  The red car needs to rejoin safely, and in my opinion, should have been slowing down more to get back on the track.  From what I see, the red car should have slowed down more and then tried to return to the surface behind yellow.

In the interest of purely avoiding an incident, yellow could have slowed more in order to not be taken out by red.  Red was pretty obviously not going to make the corner by the time yellow passed them.

Perhaps more context on how red ended up in the grass could change my mind, but I think this one is 100% on red.

Finally, I think yellow's rejoin at the end was also a bad rejoin.  It seems like yellow just gunned it to the track, very possibly wrecking the white 24 in the process."
Its rookie? Ring Meister is C Class is it not?
Ring is not a rookie series.
There was nobody else coming for ages
"He made it safely by him and red has plenty of time to slow up to not re-enter like that, even with the grass physics. I think I remember seeing you in the pit exit video yesterday defending the black car that completely blasted someone exiting the pit safely."
What?! lol
Who are you talking to? Schizophrenic episode?
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"Red just simply went wide in the previous corner. 

I will not report though. Bringing penalties into a game just feels so morally wrong to me."
I figured with people driving like this it was the rookie mx5 series. Especially since OP didn't tow and decided to drive around track running into walls till they got DQed with a broken car. Sorry about that.
Please read my edit. Sorry

"he saw him go off track and slipped ahead of him. That entire section is downhill and has high speed. That means the guy is going to blow by the braking point and go across the track and into the gravel. It was painfully obvious. By continuing forward instead of staying behind, you are placing yourself in danger. If he would've slowed down and allowed the guy to crash into the gravel trap, he would've survived. It's clear as day. Now whether or not everyone else would've slowed down or slammed into the back of him is another story. 

OP asked for tips on how to avoid a crash, I gave a tip."
That’s the reason people feel empowered to do shit like that. You literally pay money for the reporting system. Use it and help make the service better for everyone.
"But that’s the whole point of having a sporting code. You read the code, didn’t you? Verbal abuse has no place in life. Protest his voice chat and move on."
"One of the reasons I pay good money to play on iRacing is the fact that there are penalties, which keep knuckleheads from doing knucklehead things.  Verbal abuse should not be tolerated in any shape or form.  I explictly play this game because of the penalties for bad behavior.

If red just went wide, then yes, 100% on them to rejoin the racing surface safely.  Even if that means they have to park the car and tow or wait until the entire field passed.  That also goes for your rejoin after being punted too.

I personally use relative and and a minimap to rejoin safely."
"A couple of days ago I did my first report in a couple of years on Iracing. I just never had a real situation where it was needed. 

Until a race a couple of days ago where a backmarker was holding up me and some others constantly, leading to a crash behind him. He was actively blocking everyone, swerving left and right. At Charlotte Roval, where it's already hard to overtake anyway. 

So yeah.. ofcourse I don't know the outcome but Iracing said they would let the driver know the outcome. I can only hope he learns from it. And that should be the main goal of reporting, making others learn from their misbehaviour or in the end get banned. It's only needs to better and cleaner races."
"I mean there was plenty of time for red to slow down, even in the grass to not come back on. There isn't enough video to say if yellow rejoined unsafely or not. 

Just the incidents from the video this is 100% on red."
"But i did not rejoin then. I went close to the track, checked my mirrors and went, when it was free."
"I didn't downvote the question. I downvoted you being extremely toxic and having your posts removed.

e2: LOL these posts were auto removed as well for being toxic."
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
He could have jammed on the brakes and been just as likely to be involved in an incident.  The onus is 100% on the guy off track to rejoin safely.  I don’t think OP could have done much differently and I would not want to train my racing reflexes to react in the manner you suggested either.
The OP says what they did in the comments. Their only defence is there wasn't anyone for miles but the video clearly shows otherwise. They then drive around in a wrecked car till they hit enough walls to DQ.
Unfortunately i tried carriying the broken car around the track. It was basically impossible and gave me enough INC for a DQ. Although I never went over 50 mph. Just kept turning into the wall
[removed]
"https://old.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/19eojzs/15_minutes_after_the_last_race_ending_in_l1/kje71h3/ - if they want to get INC points from smashing into walls with no one around, thats on them. If he did it with people around - then yeah, hes an idiot."
"So you couldn't continue but still did just running into walls instead of getting a safe tow to the pits? This is also protestable. 

Also driving towards the track, while off track in a gravel trap, right into on coming traffic is an unsafe rejoin whether you hit the track or not. You are supposed to stop until traffic has passed then rejoin. The people coming at you at full speed can not judge what you're doing off to the side coming right at them. 

By your own admission you did worse for the race then the red car."
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
8.1.1.6 of the sporting code says otherwise. You are not allowed to ride around at reduced speeds in a broken car.
">Also driving towards the track, while off track in a gravel trap, right into on coming traffic is an unsafe rejoin

No, it's not."
How am I supposed to know if someone is coming without aligning along the track to get it in the mirrors?
"> 8.1.1.6

*Drivers may not drive damaged vehicles on the apron at reduced speeds with the intent of 
gaining positions from drivers that have retired or disconnected due to damaged race cars. The intent of this 
action is contradictory to the spirit of competition and creates an unsafe environment for the remaining drivers 
not damaged and still racing. A protest may be filed through the proper channels for this offense*

-------------------------------------------------


Let me know where there is an apron at nords. If you don't have a meatball you can cruise around the track all you want as long as you don't hinder others. If you do have a meatball and you don't take care of it - the penalty is given in game.

e: is blocking people the go to thing to do in this sub? I have proven 3 people wrong in the last week and have been blocked instantly."
The person clearly drove right into traffic at the end of the video. If you floor it right to the track in a car with the donut flag right at traffic it's an unsafe rejoin. Which is exactly what this person did. Then they proceeded to drive around till they hit enough walls to DQ themself with a broken car. This is pretty cut and dry.
"SO driving towards the track is now driving into traffic or are you just really hoping that actually happened, even though theres 0 evidence, so you can stay on this soapbox you built?"
"You think it’s a rookie series, you call it a donut flag, it is obvious OP stops at the edge but you say it is an unsafe rejoin.  You’re making yourself look silly.

And the clue is in the terminology, it can’t be an unsafe rejoin if he doesn’t rejoin the track."
I already posted the evidence. It's my post up there that is not being downvoted by two or three people. 👍

"Use the auto-ffb option in Iracing, you need to do that for every car. Bind the auto-ffb option to a button, open the blackbox with the auto-ffb option (graphical adjustments I believe), it lights up after driving a lap or so, then press the auto-ffb button and it adjusts the force.

Works great."
"Hey thanks for this.  By default will it set it per-car or do I need to set that ""custom controls per car"" checkbox in the UI?  Thanks in advance."
You need to set the check box.
Have been racing in the SF23 series with these guys and it's a great group of people with good racing!
Really enjoyed the race yesterday. Looking forward to you the next.
Would be more interested if I was allowed to use a driving line.
"You can combine a fixed - c fixed or b fixed - c fixed. You just need to withdraw middle of another session to register next one.
E. Keep in mind that if you disconnect after withdraw its done, can't join back."
"He definitely should've not rejoined and held the brakes to slide off the side.

You, on the other hand, seem to have been staring at the line and not paying attention to the car in front, because you had 3-5 business days to see them coming back on track. You have brakes too, and it would've saved you some incident points."
"That wasn't about him holding the brakes. He was gonna spin at that point no matter what. Plus, if you saw that happening the whole time why didn't YOU hit your brakes? If you slowed down and given yourself enough time to move left he would have went off the track by himself anyway."
Idk if him holding his brakes would have helped out much in that situation. You where cookin already
Turn the racing line off I beg
"Jfc. 

How about you pay attention?"
Obligatory “turn off the racing line” comment
">hold your brakes i beg

![gif](giphy|OYjrA155y3lv2)

I see another cause.."
As soon as you seen him go off you shouldve backed out and slowed down. Mx5s have good visibility.
"Not really a hold your breaks situation here? He fucked up his rejoin, that’s not how hold your breaks work. Should be titled “why didn’t I use my breaks” as I had 34 car lengths to see danger and held my line without breaking or potentially lifting"
"Blindly following the racing line, you shouldn’t need it to turn red to tell you you need to brake and if you could not anticipate what was going to happen you have a long way to go. Its easy to blame someone else, its harder to look at what you could have done differently"
And on today's episode of the pot calling the kettle black...
There was very likely a yellow flag being ignored moments before this…
This is as much on you as him mate. Clearly staring at the line instead of focusing on the road ahead.
"""3-5 business days ..."" LMAO"
"This is 100%

You can even see him correct BACK to the line and hold. 


The other driver lost all control, but this could've been avoided I think.

The sooner you can watch a replay and answer the one queation, the sooner you'll move forward on this journey.


The question is..

What could I have done differently?"
i mean i saw him whoosh back into the middle of the track at the last second so i couldn’t really do anything but i guess if he just stayed on the outside or off the track till i passed that would have been a better outcome 🤷‍♂️
"I mean, the assessment isn’t wrong… there is even a nice straight zone for some unexpected braking without turning!"
"If you're seeing that at the last second move your flag somewhere to where you can see it and turn up the spotter. People are always going to be dumb while you're technically correct that won't fix the car during a race.

Turn off the racing line in races you may lose some pace in the short term but it helps that fixation to not move from the line. 

This coming from someone who used to do the exact same thing way longer than i should have."
"It's rookies, right?

This is one of those situations where you're better off assuming they'll do something stupid, rather than hoping they won't."
you are not allowed to brake unless the racing line changes color...
"Short answer p2 missed the jump and because you (and P3) passed them before the green, you got penalised. You cannot pass cars until the green is shown. This also causes problems when people spin out on the formation lap.

No I doubt it was deliberate, but it would do you some good to read up on start procedures in the sporting code."
"The iRacing Driving school is even better. Watch the videos on their website and you get an achievement

"Thank you, will do"
I'll check it out thanks
No. Run minimum pressures.
"From all the research ive gathered everyone seems to say to run lowest possible pressure and make sure the outside and inside temps are lower than the middle temp, this is my first time making my own setup sorry if its a stupid question"
Maybe if I knew what kilopascals actually was
"Minimum pressures, never heard about middle temp higher, internal temp should be higher because of camber."
"A common reason you get rear ended is because you're braking earlier than the guy behind you expects you to. 

You may think you're doing the right thing if you're being super timid at the start, but you're acting in an unpredictable manner which just increases the chance of an incident."
"Communicate your intent with your driving.  If you're gonna brake early don't just slam on the brakes earlier, lift and ease into the brakes to give the person behind time to react to you.

Don't brake behind someone if you can, go for an empty gap or position yourself near the edge of the track to give yourself an exit path.  If the person behind outbraked themselves you can let off the brakes and go off the track to avoid getting collected."
"If this is 2.5k+ then you’re braking earlier than normal which is fine but you need to make it super clear that you’re going to brake early. Get out from directly in front of the car behind you and lightly press your brake before actually braking so the brake lights come on. 

If this is <2.5k then this is just normal territory with the Porsche Cup considering the lack of ABS and cold tires. If someone is right up on you then use the same steps that I outlined above, not to say that you’re braking early but to fool the guy behind you into braking at a normal point."
T1 L1 and you don’t anticipate the very high probability that its going to be 2 wide?
"As someone who drove 8 hours in the Daytona 24 and earned 9x with 0 contact, I can confirm from other comments that consistent braking is key. If I'm being followed closely, I'll lift significantly sooner before I brake to telegraph my braking. That way I slow far more predictably for the car behind. 

If battling into a corner, know that you _will not_ take your normal line. Forgot your line exists and adapt. Attempting to use your planned line will most likely result in contact. If a car is faster on the inside, try optimizing your line for a late apex and undercut. If they're faster on the outside, brake a bit earlier to make the corner at the same time in order to force them outside. 

Contact is almost always a two player incident. One person can be at fault but the other, in most cases, could have avoided it. The next time you end up in an incident, don't think of it as passively being hit. Think of it as _you failing_ to actively avoid the incident. Study it."
On first lap avoid being on the outside line as much as possible
"start at back or pack or even fall back, let them take each other out, in rookie and D class i would always just start from back and let everyone take each other out, always ended up in top 10 off this strat"
Always coast into T1 with a standing start 
sometimes all you can do is anticipate and try and be out the way. i got my first win at usa international in street stock by anticipating the back markers would take out the cars in front of me. of course there are times where even with the best anticipation and car placement there nothing you can do to avoid the incident.
You can only control yourself.
Predict the worst thing another driver will do and dont put yourself there. Thats 99% of game
You are right if that were the case but I actually brake with the group at front keeping just a little distance from them.
I anticipate that but when a guy rear ends you with locked up brakes or tries to cut the track and hits the sausages and flies on to u when u are already in a tight situation it doesn't matter.
"Thanks for the tips, this is really helpfull."
"If you plan to brake earlier, do it very lightly at start so your brakelights lights up without your speed going down too much. This gives cars behind to react and time for you to react what happens around you."
"It sounds like you’re racing with sketchy splits. Even if you’re braking in the perfect spot, if you’re in a class where other drivers are going to screw up then you’re playing with fire.

I started getting off the racing line in turn 1, especially into the braking zone. It avoids me a lot of crashes for sure. The downside is that if I’m lower in the pack, then I’ll lose the leaders.

So, either qualify higher, or be content with a decent mid-field finish after you dodge those crashes. 
Or get lucky lol.

Personally, I’ve been farming safety rating and have found that the higher license races have had way fewer crashes. I’m working at getting more competitive with those drivers, but I haven’t seen a turn 1 pileup in my first week racing this new class."
But how do you act on that? Do you keep some extra margin so you can evade when you notice that sudden shadow moving across or filling your mirror?
"Yup. In turn 1 lap 1 I usually drag the brake a hundred meters or so before I actually start braking, just so the car behind me can tell that I’m no longer accelerating. I rarely if ever get rear ended"
"I usually try to keep a extra margin, I even avoided one guy by moving over because I saw him coming sliding towards me but sometimes I just can't leave any beacuse of the person to my right or left."
"Well you can also consider to take it defensive into those situations. 
Here telegraphing intent is very important though. 
Just go in the braking zone blocking  off the inside. You will sacrifice that corner obviously by doing so and probably have a few getting a outside run. But alot of people diving is just a see gap must senna reflex. Putting your car there advance usealy prevents that.

"Two years ago, I transitioned from the F1 games to iracing and it was immensely humbling! Took quite some time to come to grips with the physics, UI, schedules, all of it. Now? I can't ever imagine going back. It's expensive, but we're all essentially paying to be a part of the most organized sim racing league ever."
Welcome to iRacing. Don’t worry about those ‘other’ games. They’ll get used to gathering dust and being forgotten. :)
"It’s not a game, it’s a sim. Why can’t people understand that?

/s"
"Stressed, pissed off and confused?

![gif](giphy|Ae7SI3LoPYj8Q)"
"I did the same 

Bought RF2, AM2, AC, ACC on the holidays sale 

And iracing 

Played a bit of them and left iracing for last. Never could go back to any of them.

And the truth is, I know they are good products as well. But goddamn I’m happy at iracing. And I’m bad 😂"
I just want you to know that I fully support your decision to transition and think you’re very brave.
"Having fun is the most important thing. Don’t let anything get in the way of that. If it stops being fun, walk away for a bit , come back and have fun again."
"Careful with thr g word. Youll awaken the ""its a sim!"" demons here."
"I tried iRacing and sucked so much in my first race that I put it aside for a few months while I played other stuff, only to realise why so many people play it. Feels way better in wheel to wheel racing than any other sim."

Welcome to the salt mines comrade
"Coming from other games what helped me most was that I already have knowledge of a lot of the tracks. They're all much harder in iRacing, but at least I know which turn is coming up."
"No, no, he didn't slam you, he didn't bump you, he didn't nudge you... he \*rubbed\* you. And rubbin, son, is racin'.

  
Welcome to the best racing community that isn't the real thing."
Stressed? you should try LMP2 at the Nordshleife this week it's like an high tasking job it really consumes all my energy I look forward to do the IMSA endurance this week I really scared to pick that car.
"Was trying to get a buddy into iRacing so we could form an enduro team. He was onboard getting a wheel since he is a sim guy, mostly flight sims. It wasn't until I explained the having to buy the tracks and the car that he balked at. Its not for everyone but I agree 100% worth every penny. The satisfaction you gain from entering a track from the very first time to running at a racing pace and hitting a podium is one of my favorite parts of it. Then we get to do it all over again next week. 

I'm on my 4th season back and im starting to get to the point where I am hitting tracks ive raced before and its not as difficult to get back up to speed and get fast again. It comes back after a couple laps"
"I started back up about 6 months ago. I was getting into chaos constantly. I was getting mad at idiots and raging on comms a bit. My friends never had these issues to the degree I did. So then I decided to change my mindset. If I qualify in the top 5 I race for the win or a good place. But if I qualify anywhere else I am content trying to let the race come to me. I’m not going to win from there unless mistakes happen, and I can’t make those happen from where I am anyway. 

That’s just a roundabout way of saying that you need to race the cars around you and let them make the mistakes and you’ll see way better placements. That’s what’s helped me."
Welcome to the club. I always say that iRacing is where you come to find out how fast you aren’t.
"I focused on f4 past season and half and went from 1.6 to 3.1ir, recently decided to change up a bit and took on mx5 in production car series…… sooooooo stressed, this multi class bs LOLOLOL, ir tanked severely, but I’ve made up my mind, I’m gonna get up where I fell 💪💪💪"
"I played acc for a year, thought It was good. Then i tried iracing and I never looked back, everything feels better, everything...but most importantly, the brakes. I tried acc for fun last week, well, it feels like ice skating, to get the same amount of breaking force that i get on iracing i had to turn bb down to 49%, abs down to 1 and downshift like in a f1 car...the car stopped finally but it still felt like it was sliding to the apex. Oh and as someone else mentioned, the audio...why does It feel SO noisy? Why does driving a Ferrari or McLaren feels like driving a noisy truck on a bumpy road?"
"> we're all essentially paying to be a part of the most organized sim racing league ever.

This is such a good way to describe it.

Also - like every other sim is rec league, and iRacing is the travel team, for anyone who played youth sports. "
Expensive how? (Haven’t got the game yet)
"I bought AC to try it out and compare. Maybe a year ago. I didn't even start it once.... Every second I have free for racing, I just open iRacing..."
"Actually i stopped playing iRacing rn and play ac lfm, love those graphics"
"Those other ""simulators"" are just posing."
Its 69% like rl - the G force :p
"Haha I dunno maybe I’m not into it enough, but I’d put ACC on par with iracing. At least in terms of GT3/GT4 and I guess upcoming GT2. But others yea just on a lower level in varying degrees."
In other words don't listen to voice chat in the beginning. LOL
"Started early january. Last week didnt play bc didnt like the vee/mazda tracks.

This week vee track is amazing, still have to try the mazda tho!"
"Haha, the ‘it’s a sim’ brigade are on the way"
"Totally agree with that, mindset is everything. You can have 2-3 bad races and instead of getting upset you have to just take something positive from it and look forward to improving next time. Which if you practise you will and oh my, is that a great feeling when it pays off."
"Buying tracks & cars, plus the annual membership. 100% worth it, in my opinion."
"iRacing is an annual subscription. New subscriptions are discounted like 40% right now and usually stay discounted pretty consistently. Renewals outside of the Black Friday discount are usually full price.

Current prices are $13 per month, $33 for three months, $110 for a year, or $199 for two years.

You also have to pay for content, $12 for cars, $12 or $15 for tracks. There's also some legacy cars and tracks that will be much cheaper, but don't get used often in regular events. I think the only legacy car with a series is the rookie truck series and they periodically use legacy tracks in ovals most commonly. 


There are also discounts for bulk purchases, so the more you buy at once, the cheaper it is per piece. So if you buy 3-5 cars or tracks at once, you get 10% off, 6 or more at once, 15%. Once your bought 40 items, you get a permanent 20% discount. If you buy literally everything, you get 30%.

The long short of it is that iRacing can be expensive if you want to spend the money, but it doesn't have to be."
"Cars and tracks cost money, you are need to buy that you want to race. But on base subscription you have few series only in cars and tracks from subscription. They are fun. And on D licence you can race some more interesting cars and in series every 4-5 tracks out of 12 are from subscription.

So even spending money for year sub, you will race on quality content and having races every hour."
"Just buy things at least three at a time. There is a discount. And after a while you get a big discount. But you will drop a bit of money if you are going to race in multiple types of races. Some folks pick one car, and just do those races till they go a little nuts, then add something else. But in the beginning, you will need to get at least a track a week."
When I’m bored of iracing I ram into NPCs with the bus with rocket engines on BeamNG. It takes out frustration very well 10/10
"My iRacing sub expired in December and since I wasn’t racing for awhile due to life, I didn’t renew. I’ve been getting back into racing the past couple weeks with AC LFM and man it’s so good despite the low population. I do miss iRacing and will be resubbing soon, but LFM is such a great alternative."
Absolutely not hahahaha
Just got done with a race in iracing though that left a smile on my face
"I am inclined to agree. I think ACC is better to drive than iRacing GT3s. But I hate GT3s so I am on iRacing driving other things, and on ACC the only other things are ""Porsche GT3 but we took out the TC"", ""GT3 but slower"" and ""GT3 but old""."
"idk what it is about acc, something just feels off, maybe it's the sound while driver, it's so excessive"
I don’t listen to chat 99%of the time
![gif](giphy|VhX3LxnFZKg5SMakGp)
"I'm at the 40 item (plus) mark after 2 years, I just did a lot of the 'buy 3 at once' and now I just get something every month or so.  

I gave up Playstation for iRacing so I kind of justify new cars or tracks but no longer paying for PS online.   

 I do wish you could sell stuff you don't want anymore, meh"
Don’t forget the participation credits you earn just by participating in a series. Worth up to $10 per season so almost covers the cost a new car or track each season.
"I look at it as a hobby. Iracing is a hobby for me. My other hobby is golf, and it sure as shit costs more than $12-$30 a month. lol"
"Ok, thanks"
"I was curious, [this article](https://simracingsetup.com/iracing/how-much-does-all-content-in-iracing-cost/) states around $2000 for all of it."
You start getting 25% off once you own a certain amount of content.
"I haven’t purchased any additional content in iracing and I’ve had it since November. There is more than enough content with the subscription for a long time. Unless you want to drive a specific car, the base content goes a very long way."
Did that exact thing last night after a shit race
Haha 🤷‍♂️ guess I picked the wrong Reddit group to test my theory
"ha, the sound of the engine/driving when in the driver cam? yea it is rather loud. but in this age of motors sounding shittier and shittier (in my opinion), i kinda dig the roar. in iracing as well. i say turn that shit up.

i just find both games fun. iracing for sure casts a wider net as far as different types of cars/races for sure. but we're also paying yearly memberships haha and just paid once for acc (plus dlc's i guess)."
"Yeah, iRacing is really only expensive for a fairly short window of time while you're collecting the things you want. Once you have the cars you want and the common tracks, it's really only a new car here and a new track there. I'm at the point where I maybe spend about $50 a year beyond my subscription every two years."
Definitely sounds about right
but do you get the 20% +15 bulk discount? the article doesn’t specifically say you don’t it just does not mention it
It's 20% and it's after buying 40 pieces of content. I mentioned it in my comment.
"I didn’t buy anything for my first year of iRacing, this was 2017 as well with a hell of a lot less content, both free and paid, so, completely agreed here, you do not need to buy anything for awhile"
Yeah I think I got by for about a year without having to buy anything. I did buy a few things out of curiosity but I didn't *need* to for what I was racing. It's good to hang back a bit and make sure you're ready.
"it's no so much the volume, it's more the vast array of different noises going on, as i said, seems a bit excessive, kinda how a lot of games are made artificially more vibrant to catch attention, but for audio"
"Just don't fall in love with a new discipline  - I'm watching you, Dirt Oval"
"Went all out on NASCAR the first year, ran the whole schedule, own a car from every discipline. Now I haven't bought anything in well over a year.

However I did get the 40 club in a matter of months......"
Ah sorry I am bad for skimming shit. People spend 40 paragraphs stating what they could in two sentences typically. It's a bad habit I have formed.
Gonna pay closer attention. Hadn’t thought of it before. Maybe gonna peep a race at 11 :).
"I've run out of cars to test during the test drive sessions, so yesterday, I drove all the D license dirt oval cars because why not. 

Instead of running GT3s at Suzuka this week, I'm aiming for my D class Dirt Oval license. Man, this discipline seems really fun."

"No worries, bub."
I use ReShade extensively in another sim (DCS) and played with it in iRacing but the stock game does such a good job it doesn't feel necessary.
"Also used it in another sim (ACC), but I could not achieve a strong improvement."
"I've got ReShade and it works fine for me offline, but when I go Online for a race it just locks up my iRacing and I have to close it out.  I figure it's the anti-cheat code."
Auto configuration takes care of it now
It says what the people above mentioned in the release notes. This latest update made a load of changes . I would just try the default settings first and see how your performance is before manually adjusting it.
it’s now on the iracing ini file and you can adjust it there via editor
It automatically sets it to 80% now
I don’t think so. Mine was set at 16_ _ _ automatically after I ran the graphics configuration again. I forgot the exact number but it was 16000
"No, just the number of corners completed, so usually you can earn slightly more with a clean A class race than a clean Rookie race.

You licence matters though...the higher your licence is, the fewer incidents you are expected to have so you need to be much cleaner to maintain A3.0 than to maintain D3.0"
"To put this into perspective:

You would gain/lose the same amount of SR in D class ferrari fixed, as in driving in A class IMSA with the same ferrari, assuming it's the same track and lap amount. 

But you would drop way more being A4.xx than B4.xx due to higher CPI requirements:


A4.xx - 75-130 cpi

B4.xx - 50-90 cpi"
"Kinda? It doesn't really work like that, safety rating isn't based on incidents per race, it's a function of corners per incident. It's awarded at the end of a race, but that's not the way its calculated. Higher license class demands a higher CPI (corners pernincident) average to maintain said license class, so the result of that is it's easier to lose irating and harder to gain which can make it look like you gain less and lose more in a race at hugher license levels, but again, per race is not how its calculated in the first place so ""affect how much you gain per race"" isn't really the right question."
Got my SR to a B 4.75 after the 24. Now its B2.48 and I’m panicking
"No need to panic. IR and SR ebb and flow endlessly, don’t let it dictate whether you race and what series you race. The quicker you’re comfortable with this the better! Just keep having fun and remember why you started this hobby in the first place, regardless of what happens on track."
"Why are you panicking?  You're well within your B so unless you really want to run an A class series, you're completely fine.

It's also natural to have SR inflated after endurance events.  It's just making its way back to where it should be."
"There is no need to panick, but B2.5 is a CPI of roughly 25... which is one incident per 25 corners. For the average track, that's an incident every 2 laps. Worth cleaning that up, it'll likely lead to better finishes."
"Interesting point, I found that my irating was always climbing because I exclusively raced the gr86 cup so I always finished in the top 5 in top split if I didn’t have a big incident. But top split gr86 isn’t very high sof. I didn’t want to have a high irating and be a 1 trick pony so I moved to the Porsche cup and Jesus H Christ the car has a much higher skill ceiling and attracts more skilled drivers.

I feel like 2k in the gr86 is not the same as 2k in the Porsche cup. If you can hold 2k in the Porsche cup you are actually pretty good at the wheel. But no longer a big fish in a small pond.

In the gr86 it’s like there’s a limit on how fast you can go and the top guys are all doing that speed. In the Porsche cup it feels like you can always go faster and you’re racing with the big boys. 

No idea if any of that is actually true as I’m a beginner but that’s what it feels like to me."
"The math would dictate that a driver with a static skillset with equal abilities in both MX-5 and in GT3 would gain iRating faster, going from 1350 to 3000, in MX-5 than in GT3 because that driver and the drivers they compete against benefit from siphoning rating away from beginner drivers whose iRatings are not commensurate with their abilities. Most new iRacers initially dip down to 800 iRating or worse, so the 550+ iRating they lose has to go somewhere, and it goes to the more experienced and more capable drivers they compete against.

In GT3, there isn't the same influx of new drivers with iRatings not commensurate with their abilities. If anything, people new to GT3 are still gaining iRating, so the siphon is effectively reversed."
"Yes, it’s easier to gain iRating in MX5 because the car has a lower skill ceiling and even top split is usually filled with newer drivers.

I don’t think it makes that much of a difference at that low of an iRating tho, because with 3k it’s also very easy to maintain iR in GT3 even if you aren’t that fast, just by barely getting into top split and not crashing.

And you can’t compare drivers from different series, but even so at higher iRatings I’ll always think of someone who races in GT3/GTP/PCup as considerably better than someone in MX5/FVee/etc."
"They just different 3k. If both drivers mostly race on one car, they 3K different and nobody's 3K better, not better because not comparable.

In series like Rookie easy to take higher numbers, not because other racers not good enough, but because you on one car and you have small amount of tracks in schedule, they just repeat, so you return to familiar tracks.
But when you going to higher licence, you have more different tracks during same season or few seasons, so evry week for you is ""WTF is this and what next corner"", and in Rookie it's ""Ah, home, sweet home""."
"There is definitely one way that the choice of series can affect iRating (and Safety Rating), and that is the frequency of incidents.

I had two totally contrasting weeks recently. First, I did a week in the Formula 1600 Trophy. It was the best week I've had in iRacing, and probably in any sim. The racing was super close, but also super clean, and the car is very forgiving. Even though this was at Mount Panorama, which isn't known for being a forgiving circuit. I didn't get involved in any serious incidents all week, I got a fast-track promotion, and gained a ton of iR.

The following week I raced in the Porsche Cup. The car is horribly unforgiving. I started the week crashing constantly because of my own errors. After a while I got the hang of the car, but unfortunately that wasn't true of all the other drivers, and there were so many big crashes, especially on lap 1. And you can't always avoid the carnage when there are multiple big cars bouncing and spinning across the track in front of you. I was in the top split a lot of the time, but that didn't make any difference. The end result was that I lost a huge amount of both iR and SR, and gained a lot of grey hair.

tl;dr - avoid the Porsche Cup if you want to gain any kind of rating, and choose a series with less chance of random carnage."
"This is not a direct answer to your question but for me, it's not about what series is easiest to gain but, what series is easiest to lose irating. As even with very good driving i gain some irating but if I get rammed in the first corner and have to dnf, at least for me the loss of irating is usually at least 3x the previous gain 😅. For me most constant gains have been always from higher safety rating, longer  race time series like imsa or gt/gte sprints and a guaranteed loss of all ratings is ferrari gt3 challenge etc 15min d license series. So at least for me it is about consistent driving and taking series which most easily allows that. (And then there is super formula which I always think I can drive and at lap 18/20 after very good driving with no one in sight you press just a bit too much throttle and...)"
"Assuming you can win either;

Certainly the rookies have more iRating to serve up. Given that they start with a fairly average 1250; but may quickly drop due to being a bit below average (hey, someone has to be) or just being inexperienced. 

However, in some cases, especially in smaller race series where they don’t always split, a more average driver can get more iRating in a more competitive series. You might need to be in the top 5 to get iRating in rookies but in, say, US Open Wheel C which often doesn’t split, 12th place can be worth as much iRating as 4th in Rookies!"
"All these responses make sense! Part of the reason I am asking is because racing in multiple series in a season is a thing many people do. But to be competitive in each series can be hard if a not all iRating is created equal. Meaning if I’m competitive racing in a 3k iRating MX5 races, doesn’t mean I’ll be competitive in a 3k iRating GT3 race. Maybe in GT3 I should be in the 2k field. 

These are all hypothetical iRatings also, I’m not really that fast 😬"
"Nicely put.

I've found that rookies to 2.5k in the vee is just a free farm if you drive safely and somewhat quick. Mx5 though, much more competitive"
"Also, mx-5 races are shorter, which means you can run more if them. iRating is not prorated.

(I mean, technically you can also run the GT3 races back to back, but it's more of a time investment)"
It really does depend on who race against.  I used to race rookie ovals only at Charlotte in late night Aussie timeslots where there are 1 or 2 splits only and it was very easy to place top 3 and gain IR.  I could maintain a high 2k rating or further if I wanted to.  And get my butt handed to me when I go do Nsacar!
"I've found out that when driving not so populated timeslots the field is more spread out, I have no business trying to win 8k drivers, but when there are enough people that whole field is around ~3k I have good shot to win races."
"Yep did that, except in practice."
"Wish it was that turn, I hate the bit it misses out 😅"
Hi Latifi! What have you been up to?
"I ran practice last night and took the correct way, but was questioning it all the way around Ford-Kurve."
"Been there , done that"
I did the exact same thing on my first lap yesterday. I was like oh shit wrong layout.
"If this was in VR the head shakes would have been brilliant to see, lol."
"I had this experience this week but different track.  advanced mazdas at zolder, never raced there before and couldn’t figure out how i was 8 seconds off the pace.  It helps to take the alternate chicane instead of the grand prix chicane."
That's great! lol. Me and about 5 other people did the same thing when the track first went online.
I think we have all done this at one point 👍

"""TuRn OfF tHe RaCiNg LiNe"""
"Imagine if open ran the full layout and fixed ran the shorter layout. 

Would that be too mean?"
"I did do practice yesterday on this layout, but did the Proto/GT here last and it was the other one so thought wrong but didnt get a 1x just a slow quali."
"I do preffer this weeks layout, the first chicane feels allot more awkward to get a nice line through in the other one."
Goatifi*
Better get em done in practice or quali than wait for race.
"""I only forgott to turn it off, i never use it"""
"That’s what I’m saying, everybody is always telling me to turn it off but honestly I never know I’m going when it’s a new layout for me 💀"
That does sound cruel and unusual
If you have the CSL loadcells you have to change your dead zone a bit in the fanatec software. I had this issue and slightly changing my dead zone solved the issue.
What pedals do you have?
Also worth a reboot. Mine started doing this last week out of nowhere. I rebooted and it went back to normal.
"I have the same issue with my load cells, i dont recommend putting a deadzone, it will annoy you when you think youre pressing the brake but youre not. 

For me I went into the fanatec control panel and did an automatic calibration.  Also switched between manual and automatic and it seemed to fix it."
"Maybe not ideal but you can calibrate in iracing with your foot on the brake as you would rest it driving, and calibrate from there to get rid of this challenge."
"So, I'm guessing you have the upgrade kit and your resistance is more than 1. If that is the case then you will need to set a deadzone, while your at it, change that brake force to 60-70 (I use 67, most use 64 from what I can find). You should place your foot on the pedal as if you were driving, this will make the deadzone so that you can rest your foot on the brake pedal. I usually go about 3% over my resting placement to give some wiggle room."
I used to have the CSL Elite pedals (the original version) with the the load cell pedal and the elastomers on the pedal were starting to crumble and break apart and it would do exactly what your picture shows
Happened to me this week as well. Re-did the auto calibration for the pedals in the fanatec control panel. Amazing this added 2-3 sec to my time every lap
Where would i find that? I'm in the fanatec control panel right now.
"I did it a long time ago but I believe its labeled as BRF under the pedals. When I mean slightly, it was literally maybe a percent. I didn't see any noticeable difference in how much I pressed the pedals and it solved the flickering. There was no change in my braking zones, or pressure I would apply when I would brake."
"Did this, didn't eliminate it clearly but in the thing in the picture i only saw it one or twice fully on the clutch. Thanks"
How are you running the wire around your rig? You may have it coming in contact with something that may cause interference as well. I'm assuming you have the load cells correct?
please do and ~~leak your setups so I can use them~~
How does Garage 61 compare to VRS?
"I subscribed to VRS because I had it in my head that the setups would be better, the videos would be better than what’s on YouTube, and the data would be better. 

None of that was true for me. 

Absolutely no hate at all for VRS, it’s an excellent service. But I found I could put the same lap times in with Garage61 setups as VRS setups. That might be more of a reflection on my inability to extract pace than on any real difference in the setups; but I certainly couldn’t justify the cost after that."
"Hey, that's me! Feel free to AMA!"
Is it for road only? Would it be useful on ovals?
This and trophi.ai
I’m 5.5k and share my setups on here. Always need to remember a good setup for me might not work for the next person.
I use it but maybe I'm just not very smart with it because I don't know how to really get much value from it. I don't know how to read the telemetry and understand how much later to brake and so on. Or other times I see people using less brake than me or get on the throttle sooner but if I did that I feel like I would just fly off the track.
Nice.. I cannot make sense of it. Not user friendly in regards to the data itself. But I use vrs so prob would just need to be explained how to use it I’m sure. You can nab some set ups though especially on cars you don’t main
"It's a great way to learn! I've been able to do this same basic thing using Replay Analyzer with Grand Prix Legends ( precursor to NR2003 & iRacing) for 25 years. You can merge best laps from replays, show lines, telemetry, gear changes, etc, then merge them together to watch an actual video replay of the laps. GPL has always been ahead of its time. iRacing wouldn't exist without it."
"Can not only say I agree that the site is awesome, I've had conversations with Ruben Vermeersch, the owner/operator of G61 and he's a smart and helpful person."
Yes I l often use garage 61 I suggest using a setup with fuel fuel. Lower the fuel to pratice Quali laps and then full fuel to feel out for main race
It is very nice but I'm wondering how the experience will change once they inevitably have to start charging people for the service? Like right it is completely free; I don't imagine they can keep offering the service for free. It's a great service for teams but I still prefer VRS when needing setups for official events. Also they do make it quite easy for examining your telemetry against their picked drivers'.
"I’ve used both a lot.

G61 is an amazing tool for free access but I do think VRS is still the superior app. There’s more detailed telemetry when you need it but the really key thing is that there are more tools to understand where you can improve your line - G61 is a bit lacking here and that is normally the one thing that makes the biggest difference to unlocking faster lap times."
"Finally a post I can read through without shaking my head!  Thanks all!!  I’m a big fan of G61.  Personally I’ve used it more for reviewing my own telemetry to improve technique rather than comparing with others, but there is still some value in that.  In terms of others setups, I will often download a few of those that are made available, and attempt to understand how they’ve configured the car and why… and consider track conditions, season etc….  I’m new to setting up cars and this has helped a great deal in building my own… or tweaking one I’ve borrowed.  In the end, I am also of the opinion that improving driving technique should be prioritized over setup.  Thank you G61… I’ve been meaning to contribute, good reminder to do so tonight!"
"There's a huge pile of privacy options if you don't want to share your data and/or setups: [https://garage61.net/docs/usage/privacy](https://garage61.net/docs/usage/privacy)

Also, I'm now asking each user to explicitly choose their privacy settings when they sign up.

Why isn't the default private? Because I feel there's a bit too much emphasis on setups these days and I hope that by having people show what they drive, more people will realize that you can be blindingly fast on a default setup. There's so much more to be gained in fixing your driving.

Most of all I want people to be able to learn together. If that's not for you (as a pro driver or team), that's fine as well. Just make things private.

And as always I highly appreciate all the feedback. I'm putting a lot of effort into this thing (unpaid!), for the better of the simracing community. Let's make something great together."
Don't mind me.. *yoink*
"Garage61 is community shared content and VRS is curated content. 

What that means is you may have to sift through Garage61 to find setups that work for you or data that’s useful. Whereas VRS will present you with one set of each and it’ll be good stuff. Plus, VRS has videos. 

Personally, I find Garage61 to be better than VRS."
"I find it better to find someone 1 second a lap faster than you on Garage 61 arnd race that ghost in to see where you are slow compared to a ""normal"" person. On VRS you are are being compared to a pro who is sometimes 3 seconds a lap faster so it's hard to know where to start compared to a pro. With VRS the tutorial are good but you can usually find one free on YouTube."
"Garage 61 is fantastic for teams (say you join a team for a special event; being able to have a synced folder with setup(s), looking at everyone's telemetry in practice sessions, ext) whereas VRS is fantastic for your normal weekly official series stuff (providing you setups, lap data, and corner-by-corner track guides every week). I'm sure you could make Garage 61 work for the official series stuff too but I find that VRS really cuts down on how much time I used to take to find out which car I wanted to drive in the VRS Sprint series for that week, finding a decent setup, and finding a decent lap to compare against. It's well worth the monthly fee imo."
"Piggying off of this comment.

But do they not update their packs for each week? I tried using it this week for GT4 at Sandown and their pack has the track temp 10C cooler.

Not really helpful."
I can’t always find driving information on car/track combinations on VRS or other sources. I almost always can find some information on Garage 61
"I think in most cases the setups don't even matter. It can perhaps vary a bit depending on car and track, but in most cases Iracing's setups are good enough to get you in the all time top 10's or 5's."
Yes it’s great for ovals
"As a rookie, I've found it amazing for ovals. I've found it especially useful for short tracks. I've started to fix a lot of weaknesses when it comes to steering input and throttle control."
G61 provides far more tracks and cars. Also trophi.ai only seems to work up to a certain level (and not a very high one)
Not heard of that either. How does it compare?
"good examples how to read it here, it is another telemetry tool but they all are similar

[https://popometer.io/guides/popometer](https://popometer.io/guides/popometer)"
"In my experience, if you try to do the same brake/throttle input but it doesn’t feel stable, it means your line is wrong."
"It literally wouldn't have existed without GPL, in a sense it's an evolution of it. GPL was (is!) such a great game."
"Me, smart? Surely you're mistaking me for someone else!

(thanks!)"
"I hope to keep as much of it as possible free (even though it's getting close to bankrupting me). I might add new paid features, but what is there, I hope to keep that free. Simracing is expensive enough already for those who start out.

I wrote a page on that: [https://garage61.net/docs/faq/pricing](https://garage61.net/docs/faq/pricing)"
Which bits of telemetry are you missing the most?
"it was just a joke, your site is great :)"
"Thank you, love what you have done with garage61. Our team used it for the 24 and it made a big difference to our consistency as we learnt from each other. We then shared our setup once our race started (we did an early split) so others may benefit. Happy cake day to you!"
"Thank you so much for Garage 61. I use it nearly every day. I also have been surprised to see fast lap times from baseline setups, so your plan is working (for me at least)."
Love using Garage61. Is there a way to filter for people using fixed setup? I remember trying to compare my lmp3 laps but I was on fixed and all the laps I saw were with open setup which was like a 2-3 second difference.
"One thing I would love to see you change is the option to not share telemetry. I mean, fine if you don't want to share your super secret setup, but not sharing the telemetry sort goes against the the whole thing with a community based service where you compare laps. 

At the very least, make is to that you cannot see others telemetry if you don't share your own."
"Just to follow up on that, one big difference is that unlike VRS, where you have data packs with the absolute fastest you can go, you can search for laps of pretty much any pace on Garage 61.

Much of racing is subconscious: you don't think about most of the things you do, they're learned and ingrained. You can't just look at the telemetry of Max Verstappen and do exactly what he does, he does it without thinking.

To get to the level of those fastest drivers, it's much better to incrementally grow towards that. Don't compare yourself with a guy who's five seconds faster. Find one who's one second faster, try to match that. Chances are high you'll only need to make minor changes to your driving. Repeat that a few times and you will gradually grow.

On Garage 61 you can do that, work the ladder step by step."
"They have a system that doesn’t allow sharing the vrs, apex, majors etc setups on their system publicly but you can share within a team. However renaming the file is a workaround in this system, but people who know that usually have privated the setups anyhow."
"I still can't find setups, other than my teams. I do not like the website layout  I joined it looking for Oval setups, because VRS short track setups are always a couple tenths off"
lol not even close. nobody will get that kind of laps with iracing default setups.
"There are drivers who are so adaptable that they can extract all of the pace from a car no matter how it’s setup. But for most of us; we can get better laptimes with a better setup than with the default setup. Though worth noting; iRacing does a very very good job with default setups.

I can easily pick up a few tenths just by dropping in a Garage61 setup. That consistently happens for me so it’s silly not to take advantage of it in open races."
"Especially for comparing setups, I like building my own but it’s nice to glance at others and make sure I’m not ridiculously off in my build style"
Oh I'm not familiar with g61
"It allegedly uses AI to tell you where you can improve. It'll give you similar comparative telemetry but also overlay a video which is nice. It'll grade you trail braking and other aspects of driving. Not sure how accurate it is at high levels, but it's nice if you don't have anyone to ""look"" at your laps"
"Yep!  After a 15 yr hiatus, I raced GPL from 2000-2006. (Unless you count when I bought it in 98 only to throw it on the shelf after 2 months in frustration! ) Lol, but I'm back racing in leagues again, OAO, now in it's 24 season, UKGPL, and L-Open.  The love, dedication, and passion of the Modding community to keep this SIM alive and current is unlike any racing or non racing title in history. Targa Floria and Isle of Man, which both were released within the last 5 years, are absolutely works of art. Just to take a casual drive around to admire the scenery is worth it. Definitely worth a revisit if you haven't raced it in a while!

"> I hope to keep as much of it as possible free (even though it's getting close to bankrupting me).

You really should charge something for it or find a way to not flood the site with ads and get some ad revenue. No one wants a good product to cause hardship on its creator. If people leave because you ask for some sort of monthly fee or you introduce ads on the site, then it's their loss."
"There’s a lot of detail in VRS but the biggest miss for me is the line comparison graph, VRS has one that shows how far away you are from the reference lap with a sort of dotted tolerance each side"
"That's the spirit! 


And lol 11 years indeed, time flies! 🙈"
"Really like the ethos of incremental improvement, and thanks for creating this app.

Super coincidental to come across this post, as I just used your app earlier today for the first time with the telemetry. Was hitting a plateau with a new track/car combo (F4 hungaroring) and knew there was time left on the table. Compared my best lap with someone on the leaderboard with a bit higher iR and found several areas to improve right away.  Super intuitive and dropped over a second in the next practice session just from changing corner entry for a few turns and slightly adjusting my braking technique. 

Will be using this a lot more going forward."
"Yup, we really try to detect setups from commercial providers (and if your setups aren't detected, reach out to me!). Respect the hard work these people are putting in, it's a hard job they do."
I don’t think it’s a very cool move to try to publicly share paid setups though.
"It’s confusing. Garage61 is excellent, but it’s UI design is lacking in “discoverability” (a door that has a sign that says ‘push’ is helpful; a door that is obviously meant to be pushed even if it doesn’t have a sign that says push is said to have good ‘discoverability’)

Laps > Cars > Select Car > Scroll to find track > click “ranking” on the right to see the fastest laps with that car/track combo.

Once you see the list of times, the ones with the small wrench next to the “setup” button are available for you to see.

Do note that some setups are meant for qualifying and not necessarily for a race. Note the fuel used in the setup. Experiment and be mindful of tire wear."
"Hi, I'm Nobody."
"I don't think it's about adaptability per se. Rather, I look at it as first understanding what you want out of the car. In order to get the car to do what you want, you have a set of tools at your disposal. If your understanding is clear and you have mastered the tools, then you can be fast in any car.

Setups have a risk of masking your mistakes and in the long run you could be hurting your development. That's why I never try to fix anything through setup changes, that could be fixed with driving technique."
I was using it for Indycar at Phoenix the other week and being able to see my lift off and steering rate after each session and comparing it to the fast drivers from the last time it was ran helped me so much. 100% worth it.
G61 is what this post is about…
"G61 shows the telemetry of anyone who installs the software. As it's free, you will find quite a lot."
That sounds brilliant. Thanks buddy. Definitely looking that up
"Yea, this sounds really cool!"
"That's the distance left/right, correct?

What do you mean with ""dotted tolerance""? Got an example of that?"
"Oh yeah 100%. I hope my message didn’t come across as me being upset with this procedure! 😅

Although may I add that it would be very cool to see which system they are using (I.e vrs, apex, etc.) instead of just saying it’s locked for that reason."
Not sure why you are getting downvoted; it's clearly a dick move to share paid setups if you are sharing it with someone(s) that are not part of that service or if the setup has rules in place to not share it. Like sure it is super easy to just get around these rules and share it all you want but it's still a dick move.
"Awesome, thanks"
what top 5 laps do you have with iracing setups then?
I guess I’m struggling to understand what mistakes one could be making that would be mask by increasing oversteer a bit here or changing the way a particular tire gets loaded up in the corners or raising or lowering downforce to find the sweet spot between drag in the straights vs. grip in the corners…
Lmfao I'm dumb. Yeah I like both
When I signed up it was wait listed so idk if that ever opened up more. Cheers.
It is yes - it shows you where you’re within say 0.5m of the line and when you’re outside of that to highlight where you can improve the most
"Not at all, just wanted to provide a bit more background. There's a lot of misinformation out there, better to get it clear.

It's shown for some providers, those who partner up or sponsor Garage 61 in some way. If you want me to advertise your setups, at least pitch in to help keep the site running."
People are weird.
"I have a couple of top 10's in the F4 (or had, as I might've fallen back during a long hiatus). I'm not going to be more specific as I prefer to remain anonymous."
"Aero is one thing, as long as you're not compensating for a poor exit. Changing the cars balance is a textbook example of where many go wrong. This is often something you want to do because of driver error, and it's easy to end up with a car that has less grip when you try to compensate for it.

There are many things if the car is understeering, for example: Braking too hard, poor brake release, not trail braking enough, too much steering input, or maybe a combination of all of it.

Here's a good litmus test. Can you make the car spin out at will, only using brakes and steering? No power oversteer. Can you deliberately understeer through each corner? Lastly, can get the car to slide with neutral steer? That is, get the car to drift with all four wheels. 

If you can do that you're in a good place and changing the cars balance probably wont hurt you (but you might feel less inclined to do so anyway)."
Just signed up too. Says on the website they let people in from the waiting list daily. Wonder how long people are waiting. Have you been on the waiting list for a while?
"Right got it, I have something similar planned, but as always, time is the limiting factor."
Oh ok. Well thanks for taking the time to explain! 😄
do you mean in garage61 or in the official iracing leaderboard?
You’ll get an invite in a day or 2
"I waited under a week & I’ve had it for maybe a month, so I don’t think it’ll take long"
"Ah okay, yeah I've had an account for a few months now. I usually use it and then watch a full track guide if I'm going that in depth. 
Think I only waited a few weeks to get in iirc"
I got an invite in like 3 or 4 days
That would be an amazing enhancement once you have it - it would probably switch me over from VRS anyway
"Garage 61. I've had a couple of season top 5's on the Nords too (that is, official times). Only thing I would check on Iracing's setups is fuel levels (and adjust ride height accordingly). That's provided Iracing has setups for the specific track. If not, then I would tweak things a little bit."
"my bad, I misunderstood then. yeah it’s possible to get top 10s in G61, but it's not because the setup is fast, it's because G61 isn't that popular yet so there aren't many laps to compare to."
"Sure, but still - there's nothing in the setups holding the lap times back. We can look at this logically as well. The biggest impact on lap times are going to be weight and aero. 

The aero and fuel levels tend to be in a good place already. It can be worth checking the fuel levels though, but usually... nah. 

Ride height (aside from aero) and suspension settings can affect how you handle bumps and ride curbs. They're usually good, except for the rare occasion where they missed a little bit. 

Further tweaking doesn't really do anything except make the car feel a bit different. The cars are not that sensitive to setup changes anyway. And let's not forget the guys at Iracing are good.

What you end up with after all this tweaking is a car that may feel better, but isn't actually any faster. You may squeeze out a faster lap time because you're more comfortable, but that's not the same as the car being faster. 

There's one exception that I know of, and that's the MX-5. They've purposefully fucked up the toe on the baseline setup, to make the car more understeery. This has been unfucked in the advanced setup."
https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000156960-iracing-how-to-safety-rating
Can the mods of this subreddit pin a post that answers this? It feels like every other post is asking about safety rating calculations.
"You get a 0.4 SR bump once you cross a whole number, that’s why he got around 0.4 more than you"
Read the sporting code 
"This information hides in a secret document, called ""Sporting code"". 
And legends says, people on this sub 10 000 gives answer about this and you can found if little bi scroll down."
"https://preview.redd.it/mp1zvt2genec1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a54d0697e4a0d14b129971974bb3274050283f19

A) Theres plateaus on the round numbers B) SR is purely about YOUR corners per incident average"
"This weekly post again.....

It's up there with the ""I've had 10 crashes in a row but its everyone else not me"" posts."
RTFM
"I love the ""sporting code"" responses. I promise you like 98% of people haven't read the sporting code and only knew about it once somebody told them that. Nobody is reading the sporting code on their own lmao."
"Hell, I've read the Sporting Code several times and I still get confused on how the safety rating system works. Then again I did put my pants on backwards this morning."
Thanks.
Forgive my ignorance
Thanks for the information.
Half of this sub would cease to exist if people read the sporting code as well as used the search feature.
I appreciate the info!
Sporting cod? Is it a secret document about competitive cod fishing? 
"There's a pro safety rating wtf???


Why am I getting downvoted lmao "
Apologies
"I did. iRacing encourages you to do so when you sign up. Since it’s a competitive online environment, and seeing that the document wasn’t very large at all, it seemed like a good idea to know the rules. 

Heck you even get an achievement for it."
"Speak for yourself.  I downloaded it and read it before I ever signed up to iracing. I was iracing-curious and didn't understand a thing everyone was talking about here, after reading and then finally racing everything made sense. 

And guess what, if there's something I'm not sure about I go to the sporting code and 99% of the time it's in there."
"I read most of it and skimmed the rest before I ever even completed a lap. I still reference it every once in a while if I'm not clear on something. 

No idea why people act like it's some monster document akin to War and Peace. It's 42 pages. Y'all lazy."
Subreddit is pretty feral about it. People have gone through and downvoted every comment by OP just for asking
It's not your fault. It should be a pinned post.
people hate it here when u don’t treat the game like a religion. you basically walked into a church and said “jesus is in this book!?”. (im bad at metaphors)
"Yeah. There are pro qualifiers that are held and if you qualify for the qualifiers, and do well in them, you obtain a pro license. 

It’s all in the sporting code."
Not aimed at your specifically. You just know they will come up. The accident ones are the ones that annoy me lol
"Yeah I hate that about Reddit. Can't just ask a quick question and get a response, they take longer to tell you to look it up and roast you for not doing so than just answering the question. Pretty hilarious actually."
We can only have 2 posts pinned at a time and I can tell you that plenty of people still don't look at them. I put up a week 13 FAQ every season and still have to remove plenty of posts asking the same questions
"Not reading the sporting code is, in fact, his fault"
"I mean, it’s in the sporting code that iRacing asks you to read when you join."
"I've just never even seen or heard of this pro class. I probably missed it when I read the sporting code, always thought it went up to A"
Fair enough. Thanks for hearing the feedback and quick reply.
"If he didn't read it, sure. Remembering the nuances of how SR is calculated isn't exactly changing the outcome of a race."
"Are you running trading paints? There is an option in there to remove all downloaded files, and download those of the people in the current session."
It's trading paints automatically cleaning files from old races. They're being deleted because you don't need them. Why are you recovering paint files for people you raced weeks ago?
OP must be the only person in the world to have TP correctly clean up after itself. I’ve not had it work ever
"indeed, after reading your post it reminded me to check the paint folder and its currently sitting at a cool 18gb oof!"
"NGL, never checked if it does clean up for me, so not sure how well it works, but I know the option is there"
The only reason I use better tp. The cleanup works 9 out of 10 times
The original post stated that they play iRacing haha. They know. They know.
As an iracer I am not even offended
Physics&community>graphics
"I am not sure if I have just been sipping the kool-aid. Or my brain is coping because of the investment. But I genuinely do prefer the graphics from iRacing over ACC's graphics.

&#x200B;

I don't quite know how to put it into words, but ACC seems so cartoon ish to me. I don't know if it's just me though. And even weirder than that, I can do multiple fuel stints on iRacing pretty easily, but on ACC after 1 hour I am pretty exhausted.   


Not a hater by any means, I have over 1k hours on ACC, but yea."
Laughs in solid and consistent 240fps
Very funny but the graphics are getting some long over due attention.
"Lmao that's a good one tho.

 But to go back to being a snob I think AC looks way better than ACC which I think looks the worst of them all. I don't get why people use ACC as the ""this is pretty graphics"" standard."
"![gif](giphy|up931VbiJsyze)

😂"
I guess imma sick individual cause I play all 3 regularly 😎
"I honesly can't play other ""sims"".  iRacing is the only shit that feels like driving to me.  Some of the dudes in r/simracing are playing fucking Forza which is today's NFS IMO.  Cool if you like that stuff but it's not driving.  Can't just blast a corner at 100 mph in some daily driver car GTFO."
"I wish I could do ACC, but the camera on that game moves with car and it makes me sick. It’s almost like the car is just a png and the screen is moving. In iracing the camera stays still while the car is bouncing/bumping and it’s a lot better for me."
"i dont know if its a habit from my fps years, but i play on lowest visual settings for absolutely everything. i feel like iracing’s “function” is orders of magnitude more important to me than the visual fidelity."
one of these things is not like the others
"As an iRacer, I wanna know those settings, mine looks worse.   
  
Kidding aside, iRacing actually does a very decent job mimicking real life boring color pallete. I'm usually not confused with ACC or other sims shots for real life, mostly because of over saturated and semi-realistic-cartoon-like textures. but iRacing with the right combo track/car/camera actually can fool a lot of people. Combined with Reshader and you have an amazing screenshot machine ."
iRacing is fun and all but I don’t know how the Daytona 24 participants can stand to look at the ugly tire barriers at turn 1 for 500 laps straight lol
fr more competition is better for us
But fuck forza. Amirite
"I still can’t get over the weird reflection that cars on iRacing have, they’ll be pointed away from light and it will still give off a blue sky reflection for whatever reason… hope I’m not the only one triggered by this"
"I built my PC and use a 4070ti. I would keep most of the graphics on high and cap the FPS at 110. During the Daytona 24 night time, the lights and shadows dipped my fps down to 50. I get that takes up a lot of power, but that’s seems pretty unacceptable. So I’d say there should be some graphics overhaul."
In the end we all think it’s someone else’s fault when we crash.
Lmao I love it
I love it but to bad I'm shit at it
I play mainly iRacing and AC. If I want to race with other ppl online i go to iRacing. If I want to cool off/chill with some tf laps I take an old Porsche and use AC for that. Both are equally fun.
"One I really love these fantards they truly distort reality and live in a pure fantasy world.

Two This remind me how I truly hate to see avatar body when I play in VR it's something that really disturb me."
Wtf commodore 64 you using to run iRacing on lol
This is unacceptable!!! Grandstands are on! 😡😡😡
Made me laugh so can’t be mad…
Is there still a way to use those IRacing Graphics? Id kind of like to try them
"I race in VR, so every sim has the same screen door quality.  Win or cope?"
Can someone tell me what the middle game is?
Hah ! Arcade players think they share something with simracers !
Iracing all day long
"I love this because I’m completely devoted to iRacing, and I’m highly invested in the graphics as I spent many hours making cinematic videos of my racing. But I am first in line and the most enthusiastic person to make fun of the graphics. When I do it though I just get downvoted as some sort of undercover ACC agitator here to brigade."
"iRacing stan that owns all of these games and only comes back to one of them, I'm just angry that the screenshot on the bottom has grandstands and crowds enabled."
Precisely. Are we not here to race?!
The iRacing community will have you convinced that you have to choose which of these you want
ACC is stylistic art with overdone shadows and gloss.  iRacing is just a boring mimic of real life.  More people think iRacing clips are real when watching them if they don't know because a real race looks boring too it does not look like Hollywood.
"In VR for me Iracing is the cleanest looking, things like the true mirrors based on your head's location and the fact that you can see your car in your mirrors are unique to it.

But yeah the track model/environment is quite poor compared to ACC or AMS 2."
"Exactly.
Also, the car in iracing blends beautifuly with the tracks in terms of looks. For me, in ACC it looks like the car and the track are from dofferent games and the lightning doesn't matches as good as in iRacing.
I put consistency over looks 100%, and iRacing doesn't even look bad by any means."
"Same. I just can’t get into ACC. It’s kind of like ”too exaggerated” or something. I just can’t wrap my head around it.
iRacing looks so much better."
"I do too. ACC is too clean. It looks artificial. And on replays the motion is all wrong. And it's uncomfortable that they keep the camera locked down to the chassis. RHM is a necessity with ACC. 

During the pandemic I was watching the indycar sim race that they broadcast on TV with the pro drivers. My wife walks by and says ""I thought racing was cancelled."" When I told her it was a sim she had to squint her eyes and really look to see it."
"I consider ACC to be hyper-realistic, its based in reality but has the dial turned up to 11 on a lot of visual things, like contrast.

It's maybe even more noticeable on the audio side. ACC sounds like they put a microphone by the engine, one by the gearbox, one by the turbo, one by the exhaust, one by the brakes, and then just mixed it all together and maybe even exaggerated the ""cool"" sounding bits. iRacing sounds like they put a microphone in the cockpit and called it a day. My only complaint with iRacing's audio is it just seems low fidelity but otherwise it's realistic."
[deleted]
At least in VR iRacing looks like booty
"You can lower the in game saturation setting to make it feel less cartoony, or so I'm told."
"Idk what it is about iracing. It could be the lighting or color palette, but the graphics really feel like MW2’s to me."
It's not just graphics In ACC the distances feel disproportionate.
"it's somewhat of a weird thing with competitive games, everyone will prefer csgo's graphics over the new cod's graphics for competitive gameplay"
Triple monitor lower barrier of entry for me
"Certainly are, new team has started I beleive"
"Has anything been mentioned in regards to plans for this? I know the grass is getting some work, but I personally think the skyboxes and ambient lighting especially need some serious work."
You ain't a snob. I feel like the color grading in ACC is way too cartoonish.
"ACC’s world illumination seems more natural, but overall graphics wise, an updated AC is def the best."
"Forza used to be great man….

But it was never a proper sim. Just great fun."
"iRacing is not any more of a ""sim"" than ACC, R3E, AMS2 or rF2 when it comes to physics and driving experience. You're just used to it.

Now as far as simulating actual racing against human beings then yeah iRacing beats everything."
Have you tried real head motion? Could be exactly what you are looking for.
"I don't play on minimum settings, but I do turn down settings until I can get *very* high fps at all tracks. I have a 144Hz monitor, I want the game to be running *at least* 100fps on all tracks, which means on easy-to-render tracks I'll get 200+ fps."
"Spa 24hr is definitely the worst offender, it's a 2010 track, Blanchimont is full of grass, it feels horrible"
I have no idea
Automobilista 2
💀💀💀
The other communities will have you convinced that excessively shiny surfaces means high quality graphics. Iracing graphics are perfectly fine.
Whats the most realistic to real racing. What do the pros use?
"Well ACC suffers from the characteristics of the Unreal engine. Yes it looks brilliant but theres stuff like ghosting and textures poppin in and out and distorted and the performance isnt quite the same as iracing (which ofc is understandable being more graphically demanding). But its still a good game, not everyone wants to throw out hundreds of bucks for iracing."
"This 100%. Happens to me all the time on Twitter. I'll be like I didn't know X car was at this track this week, oh wait.."
"Iracings vr is the best out of all the sims, performance wise and visually imo. Surprisingly I think live for speeds is probably second best compared to Iracing. It just works out of the box and you really don't need a crazy pc to run it. Everything else is a pita to setup (rf2 I'm looking at you) or it performs terribly (looks at every unreal engine sim)"
"Any chance you could share your iRacing vr settings? Mine seems very… shimmery or something. 

I’ve got the bitrate turned up on the link cable. Running on a 4080"
"The fuck? iRacing track and cars often looks like they're from games 10-15 years apart. The environment usually looks absolutely garbage, which is then next to a nice looking car models. Combine that with some weird lighting that tries to look realistic but isn't... 

The way the cars move looks good, but the only way iRacing looks realistic is when watching a 360p video on a phone, lol."
"I can't take anybody seriously that says iracing looks like a 2008 game. Like surely you realize that's an absurd thing to say, no?  I don't think anybody will argue it's cutting edge but that's just silly."
That's because the simpler the graphics the easier it is to see opponents. Doesn't apply to simracing.
"Yes, over the development news blogs. Here are some quotes. But you should read the full context.   
[https://www.iracing.com/july-2023-development-update/](https://www.iracing.com/july-2023-development-update/) ""Recent investments into art hiring have led to our car/track dev team doubling in size.""

[https://www.iracing.com/development-update-november-2023/](https://www.iracing.com/development-update-november-2023/) ""...a significant focus this year (and last) has been the strategic expansion of our staff across many talented teams. This growth will enable iRacing to operate from a position of strength for years to come and ensure that we continue to deliver an unparalleled modern simulation experience. A big part of this modernization will involve our graphics and rendering technology, which, of course, is central to a realistic and lifelike experience. On that note, we are thrilled to upgrade our graphics team later this year through the addition of multiple industry-leading principal-level rendering programmers who (together with our existing team) will help evolve iRacing’s graphics tech in a way never before seen on this platform."""
I used to consider Forza a sim.  Then years later I bought a wheel and started iRacing.  A couple months ago I picked Forza back up for the first time since starting iRacing and just couldn't believe how arcadey it felt.
"Hard disagree, I respect Dave Kaemer's code and how much real world data he pumps into the tire model alone.  Other sims have nothing like that and most iRacers are ignorant about this stuff too.  The Tire Model alone literally has 20+ years of real world data."
"I have not, I will try that today. Thank you!"
"I can probably send you a screenshot tonight. I run a 4070 super so we should have similar-ish settings.

Main thing is, NO FSR, SPS on, reflex + boost, 16x anisotropic with >=4x MSAA, and use openxr toolkit with CAS (~70%) and foveated rendering. If it is still shimmery, look into the headset resolution and whether you are down sampling (lower res than native)."
I'm not subscribed anymore cause I don't play enough to justify the costs
Why do the pros race on iracing?
"nah, it makes the game run at higher fps, aswell as just making everything clearer. Idk, might be because I just really enjoy the old games esthetic"
"The tyre model that flips 180 degrees every couple seasons? Have you seen the lmp3 tyre model vs lmp2? Tyres in iracing road are wack, gt3 tyres feel like hot garbage and just got rerolled to an older version, I think it's the weakest point, don't get me started with lmp3 tyres, they are absolute bullshit, I run in a league with stage cautions, pitting for fresh tyres and running 6 laps behind the safety car ends with cold tyres for the fresh out of pits dude and warm up ready to pump PB's tyres for the guys that only take fuel, it really does make zero sense"
You need to look into what other sims like AMS2 are doing.
"If you get a chance that would be awesome. I have the sampling or whatever set to 1.3 in oculus but maybe I need to change it elsewhere

I didn’t change any headset settings coming from dcs"
"That’s probably where I’ll be once my Christmas new player discount runs out. 

Hopefully the F4 is out for dcs by then and my hobby interests switch to save money lol"
The fuck this has to do with how iRacing looks?
Cool man!
I'm busy because I actually race in iRacing.  No time for other games as I have other hobbies as well.
"lol I went the other way around.  I got pissed at ED promising the moon and failing to deliver time and time again.  Even with the F4, there's not going to be much to do with it w broken AI, outside of enigmas server."
Ok then I guess maybe you're not that qualified to give an opinion as fact.
Enigmas is pretty much all I do lol
Only the AMD software will reliably show the FPS with AFMF. The real test is: does it feel smoother?
"I didn't properly tried but AMD warns that this is not a good option for fast-paced game (FPS, but also most of simracing games)"
"Absolutely, however it also made my PC put off some crazy heat. May not be feasible while live streaming without some additional cooling"
Where did they say? I read release notes and didn’t see it but maybe I missed it
"In the adrenalin software, the ""?"" when you want to enable the option"
😂 I could be a dumbass. Thanks
"I tried RF2, ac and acc before landing on iracing. IMO, RF2 has great physics, but its a PITA to set up, especially if you switch cars - I dislike the UI quite a lot too. 

AC/ACC never really floated my boat - they feel a bit flat (if that makes any sense). iracing for me, gives great feedback without a tonne of fettling and most of the time, just works... that goes a long way. 

id say RF2 is the closest to iracing, albeit with a lot more adjustment required to get it right. 

People complain about the cost of iracing, and I get that, but it offers you a decent experience, constantly changing content and an active and (mostly) decent community."
"The answer to this question is almost invariably ""the sim I started first is better"". depends on if you want canned rear tire feedback or only what the steering column feeds.

For me I don't care for AC/C ffb and I feel everything great in iracing."
IRacing only gives you what you are supposed to feel like driving in a real car. You are also paying for the best multiplayer racing experience.
"iRacing > ACC. Anyday, for me.

Some people can argue for ages about the differences but no one can say ”this one is better.
I feel iRacing a whole lot more than whatever ACC has.
AC is non-comprable without modding."
"Personally I like the way you can feel the tyres 'load up' in iRacing. The way it communicates it feels like a car.

All the others have great FFB too but on this one thing I much prefer iRacing, and it helps me feel what the weight of the car is doing clearly."
"I would say iRacings FFB can feel a bit ""dry"" on first experience because it doesn't add additional effects and forces like other Sims. Somehow it's still unique to simulate FFB like that. IMHO I like it way more than AC and AMS2."
"It might be because I have a shitty wheel, but I think other games are much more communicative via the wheel. The feedback in iRacing really doesn’t add much on my sad TMX wheel, but other games it does

I think this is also because other games insert feedback that is not realistic, but is helpful"
"It really comes down to personal preference. 

iRacing has fairly “vanilla” FFB. They try to simulate only what would normally come through the steering column. At times though it can feel a bit soft or weak. One kerb will cause vibrations and another won’t feel any different than the paved road surface. And I certainly feel less through my 12nm DD wheel than I feel in my real road car. 

Other games will jazz it up. They’ll add artificial additional things to help you feel what the car is doing; such as when it’s about to lose traction or something. 

Some prefer the latter, some prefer the former. 

iRFFB exists as a third party tool that can spice up your FFB in iRacing if you wish."
"FFB is very wheel dependent on every sim.  ACC is really bad with a G29, while iRacing is fantastic with it.  But the opposite can be true with other wheels"
"I have all this games and sims, and I love iRacing FFB, but ACC is more entertaining.

In iRacing FFB more real, but in ACC and ASM2 FFB trying to entertain you, they add additional FFB for more feels ""real"". It's like you looking Discovery channel about lions (iRacing) and Disney's King Lion (ACC, ASM2). Or iRacing FFB is like NASA film about space and International Space Station and ACC and ASM2 like StarWars.

What you are more prefer that you will be like."
"Iracing has the most detailed FFB out there. Nothing honestly compares to me and I promise im not a paid actor. It’s just that far ahead of everything else. 

AC and ACC are fun but feel in need of an overhaul. They are noticeable more vague. I only tried AMS2 once, I remember it was also a fun experience but more like PC2. Definitely has some forgiveness in the handling model.

Iracing is pretty hardcore. Every style of car handles wildly different to one another. Some drive like they are on rails. Other you need to drive with your pedals and trail brake effectively to be quick. I highly highly highly recommend if you’re looking for competitive racing and to improve your skills, but I recognize the price is a barrier. Hope you enjoy if you give it a whirl"
"The FFB is decent, but not remarkable by any means imo."
"I started in AC, then ACC, and finally iRacing. I personally love iracings ffb, it’s the main reason I can’t go back to other titles. Closest would be AC, imo. I just feel like that line for the limit of grip and going over is more defined. I steer more with throttle and brake than I do in other sims. I just feel like I know what the car is doing, and more importantly, what it wants to do."
"ffb is one of IRacing weaknesses imo, RF2, AC, AMS much better"
"I have tried to compare it to ACC & iRacing, and I think they're pretty on par/similiar.  


I did enjoy ACC feedback more on belt driven wheel, I felt like I missed something in iRacing with it. However now with my CSL DD they're pretty much the same.  


I think the only option for you to find out is to try iRacing out. Luckily its subscription based so you're not out 70 bucks at once. (Although comparibly it does gets more expensive afterwards, but thats a price most of us are willing to pay)  


If you're lucky you might find someone with a cheap trial :)"
[deleted]
"Dude iRacing doesn't cost more for nothing the experience you get in iRacing is a premium one, comparing only the FFB is wrong and misleading... But in iRacing FFB is what you feel in the real car or at least it's what the devil aim to it's not easy to be honest but they work hard and continue to fine tune the sim constantly not like Mr Massarutto going to sail after the build and ignore his customers for a couple of years...lol. 🤣"
"iRacing is the only one I’ve done that actually feels the way it does in real life, IMO. I’ve spent 20 years doing karting and have done both Formula Vee and Formula Ford on and off. iRacing give me the same feel through the wheel I get in a real car. I’ve tried a bunch of different ones and iRacing seems to have had the most real world driver input. It’s the only one I race on weekly."
I think you should ask r/simracing . Asking this subreddit is obviously going to have quite a bit of bias towards iRacing.
"Each sim has it's unique ""language"", this being how they communicate with the FFB, ACC speaks spanish and iracing english, if you are an ACC main and jump to iracing, you won't understand it, and it will feel like shit, same happens if you switch roles, you need to understand that language in order to interpret what the ffb is trying to tell you. And yeah, GT3s won't be super visceral with feeling, those cars are made for dentists"
Iracing is closest to ACC's FFB.
The feed back is good but you will mostly notice the lack of it. What i mean is you wont feel it when people run you off the road because iracing actually gives you a way to stop it and report bad drivers
"Haven't driven rf2 in a few years but when I did the physics and FFB felt better than iracing. 

BUT (BIG BUT) there were 2 issues that caused me to stop racing it:

1. Seemingly every time I logged in there was some error I needed to fix. It was basically a 2:1 ratio on driving to fixing.

2. The physics felt better but they were broken. In order to get a fast time you would need to introduce a bunch of slip angle. That's not realistic. 

Since I switched to iracing they've made a lot of improvements in the physics, FFB and tire model and rf2 has basically stood still in development. So if I had to guess iracing is probably pretty close if not better than rf2 at this point."
"FFB is like pizza. We all like pizza but there are different styles from each pizza joint. The customer also has a preference on toppings, and some joints do a better job with the toppings they like.

I like open wheelers, and iRacing has the best lineup of official series for them. I think the FFB for their open wheelers is the best in the business."
"The point is, the whole iracing package is by far the best experience you can get."
"People say ACC has “more” detail, but the question is which is more realistic? 

More doesn’t always mean better, and I can’t say I’ve driven a GT3 car, but I like the feeling of iracing and find ACC to be too busy at times."
"Iracing FFB unique, instead of making it feel a certain way, they map the steering forces acted upon the steering column.  thats what you get.  no filters to make it “feel” a certain way.  

It might feel funny at first, but once you get used to it you’ll hate everyone else’s FFB"
I tried ACC and AC. And also Forza Motorsport. But I feel only on iRacing this connection with the car. I never felt something similar with any other racing game. One time started I couldn’t stop anymore. Maybe better not to start 😂
The reason I use iracing is because of its ffb. It's the only sim I've used with an auto calibrate and it works amazingly well. I get super annoyed going back and forth in menus and game play trying to get ffb to work well and iracing just does it for you. Super convenient and feels great
"I started with AC and when I moved to iRacing, well iRacing just felt better.

More communicative? I feel like I felt more what was going on before the limit. Granted at the time I was driving on a Logitech G25, but I remember being really impressed with iRacing."
I'm still using IRFFB instead of the normal force feedback. To me it makes the G29 feel more alive. But if I had a better wheel I would go back to the standard iRacing one and see how it is.
"IMO iRacing ffb feels better than ACC ffb but less communicative, by which I mean oversteer/understeer/tire grip are much more obvious on ACC where they are more nuanced in iRacing."
AC feels way better to me but iracing got that multiplayer.
I bought rf2 and gave up on it after how annoying it is to get it set up. I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks so lol
"I was doing karting before I started simracing, so that was my reference.


On iRacing I feel what I would expect to feel on my hands. Granted, you don't have any feeling of what's happening on the back of the car, but getting that info on your hands, like other sims do, is weird to me. I would expect to feel that on my ass."
"I downloaded acc first.  I have to say I found the thing undrivable.  The car is all over the place and impossible for me to control.  I tried I racing a few hours later and found it much more enjoyable.  

Now a month into iracing, thinking maybe I needed to just get used to sims, I still feel like acc is no better and still undrivable.  Similar story with automobilista 2.

I am not sure why I have so much difficulty in the other sims."
I started on ACC (granted it was on Xbox) and when I got a PC and tried Iracing I found it much better. Especially the breaking. I'd still go back and play ACC if I was doing AI racing tho as I did find the AI really fun in that game.
"Yes it comes to that. And it’s really easy to just get used to what you drive. The worst FFB is Rennsport imho, and probably GT7"
"I find their FFB fantastic. It feels just like driving a real car on track. I’ve never driven a race car or on slick tires but it’s the most intuitive after all the sims I tried. Yes ACC seems to have more detail but I can’t relate to it and the car feels very floaty. 
I have a SC2 Pro for reference"
"I disagree only on one point but it's gotten much better with the newest tire models and cars. At least with my Fanatec DD1 most cars have no feel for understeer. The steering resistance stacks up but there's no edge to feel where the tires start slipping too much and the steering gets lighter. I can and have induced understeer deliberately tons of times trying all sorts of settings. There was no change in FFB resistance despite the front tires freely sliding across the track.


In a real car the feel through the steering wheels gets lighter and vague with understeer. There's an edge or cliff that you should be able feel that just didn't exist in iRacing. Even real life pros have commented on this and this is why you need to drive with the tire sound cranked up and gauge front end grip by sound rather than FFB feel.


The SF23 does actually have a good feel for understeer and oversteer. Which I think is why so many people immediately fell in love with it at release.



I'm not comparing this to AC's exaggerated understeer filter that's turned on by default."
"I spent a long time tuning my Simucube FFB profile  for ACC until I’m happy with it, and I wouldn’t say iRacing is much better. But I agree that out of the box, iRacing requires less tuning to be satisfied"
I need to mess with my settings because I feel you lose a lot of feedback at the limit in iRacing.
"iRacing tends to do better with the higher quality wheels as they can ""keep up"" with the forces that iRacing generates. "
"Exactly, I had to tune my Simucube FFB profile much longer with ACC for me to be satisfied. But in the end they are both very (different but) good once tuned to your liking."
"Aris once explained their approach for FFB in ACC and it’s the same as in iracing, they don’t add any artificial effects. It’s quite interesting that it feels very different compared to iracing despite both having the same philosophy behind it. 

I personally prefer iracings FFB feel as well, just wanted to clarify that ACC doesn’t add artificial effects either"
"This is misleading and wrong.
iRacing has the best physics, yet the FFB is subpar due to its 60Hz nature. ACC FFB is way more detailed due to high refresh rate and inclusion of tyre aspects, iRacing only considers forces from steering rack.
This is not as bad as it sounds, if your using much damping and smoothing anyway, you wont notice. Even when not, the amazing car physics make up for it - IMO"
Lol exact opposite. Iracing is what you would feel if you’ve ever raced a car. All the others add a bunch of extra stuff into ffb lol
"ACC is better marginally but hard to get the FFB really dialled in to the point where no having it set up right feels terrible.

Iracing has a bigger window where it feels good.

This is my experience with several wheels"
Ams2 and acc also add extra effects though. You don’t necessarily feel them through the steeringwheel in real life
I never suggested I was only comparing the FFB.
Oh and now Aris has left Kunos 2 weeks ago to go work on a crypto scam so they've even lost their phyiscs expert
"Well, I figured the people who knew iRacing the best would be the best people to ask under the assumption that you all had also driven other sims.  Also any mention of iRacing outside of iRacing circles leads to endless rants about the cost and business model which makes about as much sense as saying a Ferrari is a bad car just because I can’t afford one."
"Same here, RF2 looks like it doesn’t want you to play it"
Same here.  So hard to access that I deleted it.  It’s an insult to their customers.
"It’s not quite a slide / rotation in your gut, but a bass shaker (buttkicker etc) can add some of that feeling if motion is too expensive."
"ACC also has this “we only model the steering rack” approach.  The problem I have with it, and the reason I asked for the comparison before committing to iRacing, is that I’m puzzled by how you know what the back end is doing if you don’t have a motion rig or hardware.  Isn’t “fake” info via the wheel better than *no* info?  Maybe you just use tire sound and graphics?"
"Stock acc setups are undrivable, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

The game is an exploit simulator at the highest level as well lol"
I had much closer times to the faster people in my league on iracing over acc. But also I had improved a lot using acc before iracing. But I haven't gone back since I started iracing. It's just much more fun for me.
"Whaaat? :D
I love these kind of topics, it brings out pure gold like this :D"
"Not really, most people just don't tune the settings well for low power wheels because they amplify the forces on the lower end. 


You can scale the entire iRacing force output over a 2.2nm scale for a G29. "
"As I'm who not to deeply into technical moments of ACC, I talk from consumer point. For me it's feel artificial for entertaining.

Thanks for your clarification."
"Good point, now that I think about it too, I played those other games on the G27 and I’m currently using my CSL DD on iracing so now way to compare those two"
"Technically you can get 360hz FFB in iRacing now, however it's extremely wheel limited.  I don't yet have any idea what it feels like as I don't have a supported wheel yet, however soon as Simucube has been working with iRacing to add support for the feature.    


[https://trello.com/c/puUGh7lH/11-iracing-360-hz-torque-refresh-rate-support](https://trello.com/c/puUGh7lH/11-iracing-360-hz-torque-refresh-rate-support)  


So the times are, undoubtedly, changing."
"I feel like since 1.9 the ffb in acc is just to muddy. It used to feel sharper before.

Iracings ffb is easier to get information out of."
First Stefano Casillo now Aris ... I heard there is only Mister Massorutto left in ACC...
"Haha yeah, the subscription pricing rants. I definitely get it. Ignore the noise. But there's definitely bias around here just due to that it it's something they already pay for and have justified the cost. 

I'm an 11 year member (and get a content discount...) but am taking a break from it and letting it lapse shortly (for a bit). For me, I simply don't do enough multiplayer races to justify paying for it. Even if it was a one-time fee and comparing to other sims I'd say iRacing has a really ""clunky"" FBB model that feels more sterile vs the others. I also think that the physics still feels floaty and just don't get a good connected feeling to the road as I do with other sims. Not to say it's bad, no way. But ll of that can be forgiven because the multiplayer servers work so well."
It used to be even much worse. Their former UI was absolute hell.
"I have some other things that need upgrading before I get to that, but it's something I would like to get at some point.


Is it worth it?"
You can tell through visual and audio cues 
"You can add a bit of that feeling in via a 3rd party tool called iRFFB (or a more recently maintained fork of it called iRFFB2022). Gives you more oversteer, understeer, and suspension feel, all adjustable. 


I have an entry level wheel and no other haptics or motion, and find it to be really helpful"
Good to know 😂.  How do you set it up right? I feel like I am on Bambi on ice spinning and sliding everywhere when on acc or automobilista 2.   I have tried following some settings and feedback adjustments based on various online posts but it’s still dog shit.
"?  Low end wheels can't repro forces accurately or quickly.  iRacing generates high quality forces.   It's why people think it feels ""dead"" on low end wheels, it's becuase their hardware can't reproduce the forces."
"Thanks!
Is this any different than what iRFFB does? 
With same ffb latency increase?"
Will you lose your paid cars and tracks and have to buy them again if you let your subscription lapse?
Yes it’s absolutely worth it and it’s cheap as hell too. For 150 you can get two Dayton BST1 and one Nobsound Mini Amp for example
"a pair of bass shakers are totally worth it, they add a lot in the way of feedback and immersion. they're not too pricey either."
"It was so worth it for me that I'll say: hold any other upgrade until you do it 

Using the iRacing LFE, I don't want to feel things I should not with simhub. Using a gamer 2 pro.

(Yes, I also don't like how ACC does things with sounds and feedback, is not ""natural"" if you have raced stuff irl.)"
"like you, Ive done a fair bit of irl driving (tests for an oem rather than karts) and can’t stand ‘seat of pants’ feeling. Without spending a kings ransom it’s been a big help getting some of that data/feeling back once I got it right. Rumble feeling in your back is just enough of a clue that you’re close to the edge."
"Absolutely.

Don't waste your money in Buttkickers though. The Dayton bass shakers are a lot cheaper and, in my experience, better in just about every way other than looking cool."
Nope. They're available anytime you re-subscribe.
That's a very interesting option.
"Oh crap, you may have just pushed me over the edge on deciding to subscribe.  Time for a family budget meeting."
"You won't find a better multiplayer experience, that's for sure. But if you just wanna do solo hotlaps, or AI then look elsewhere. There's usually some good new member sign-up incentives. Just be aware that you'll want to budget in costs for additional content (cars, but mostly tracks)."
If you decide to make one I’m game
"You need to run the auto FFB setting in the blackbox every time you get in a new car. This is an iRacing thing. Once you have your settings right within the actual settings tab just go through the blackbox ffb setup and then auto run it as needed between cars.

There's nothing wrong with your wheel - I promise."
"Thanks for replying.  I only race one car, Dallara F3. I don’t race any other cars. 

I’ve had the wheel just over a year and had no problems until now.

It’s seems to drastically  change the FFB when I change set up of the car ( 
Qualifying setup/ race setup ). I realise that different setups will change how the wheel feels but the difference is drastic. 

I’ve race Dallara F3 for over a year. And have never experienced this before."
Or it’s just lap 1 and you both have cold tires and were excited to be at the front.
"If you both did that on purpose, that's really amazing and impressive! 10/10 score. But probably just netcode."
It’s netcode that it’s synchronized? Or it’s netcode that there was contact somewhere?
"I don't think that's net code.   It looked almost too smooth...🕵️🕵️🕵️

While I'm not 100% sure and can't be without seeing one of their cockpit views to see if the wheels got flicked towards the left during the questioned spins.  

It just seems like they both were gunning a little too hard into T1 on the start.     They very well could have also left each other too much room.   This combo would allow for the spins.   Given the state of the tires being cold as ice lol.    

Interesting clip.  Made my night."
"Alright, who here planted the land mine?"
Beautifull !
"It wasn't me, I am the black car that needed to avoid them. Got the win in the end!"
"There’s 5 different time slots for this series.
Wednesday 3pm

Thursday 8pm

Saturday 4am (for non NA people)

Saturday 11am

Sunday 8pm

The NASCAR cup series that follows the real life schedule and is half distance and some full length races like Daytona has similar timeslots each week. Good fun at least a couple of pit stops each race."
"There is not one per day, it's 5 fixed and 5 open setups per week. Race times not only for Americans, we European race in Nascar too, so some time slots for as. In some times I woke up at 2:00 (night) for race in Nascar, some time slots are just for me, because it's Saturday 11:00 and 18:00 for me.

This series only winter time, that's why it's called Nascar Winter Series and it's for fullfil empty time of Nascar iRacing Series. 
Yes, every race in Nascar Winter Series around 2h. Is it hard? I don't know, for me it is not hard, I love it.

When Nascar Winter Series will ends we will have Nascar iRacing Series that follows real words Nascar schedule. This series will be in same time slots as Winter Series and duration will be mostly 50% of real time duration (in laps, not in time), but races like Daytona 500, Coke 600 and ect will be 100% distance. For example, last Coke 600 was 4h race in my split.

Is you bought 87 car and will not able to race until next winter? No, you can race on this car in NASCAR Legends Series on B licence."
"Thanks for the information. Interesting there's only one per day, especially with the popularity of super speedways on iRacing. The 8 pm looks inviting. People who just join without practicing in the 1987's don't realize the car is like driving a metal shopping cart at 210+ mph, but it's a blast."
Wait will Daytona have both open and fixed setup races daily?
"Thanks for the detailed explanation. I think I'm close to the B promotion. I believe I need to get to 4.0 for a promotion from C to B & currently sitting at 3.88 with the minimum races completed. I normally don't care about the iRacing ratings, but I like getting a few more NASCAR series in B that C doesn't offer."
"I fully recognize this, and thats why I love racing them lol"
"Yes, but not in Nascar iRacing Series. Daytona will be in NASCAR class A (NASCAR cup car) when in will be week there we have Daytona 500. February 13 week is start. And from this point, NASCAR class A open 70 laps on Daytona and NASCAR class A fixed 35 laps, both series have races every 2 hours.

And yep, Daytona 500 5 fixed and 5 open races, 200 laps.

And from February 13 NASCAR class A both races will follow real world NASCAR schedule like NASCAR iRacing Series but with shorter distance and every two hoursl."
WNIS and NIS is easy safety rating
"You need the subscription, and any race you want to watch you need the track and at least one eligible car. You can’t spectate without owning the content. It’s a big investment just to be a spotter."
"Iracing should really have a spotter account for a lower price (maybe just one per regular acct?)

Can’t race. Just spectate. But with no content ownership requirement. Just a subscription. 


I’d get one for my living room to broadcast races on my tv while I’m racing"
If I had a friend who was going to spot for me like that I’d be gifting him the content.
Why would you want to do that?
"Yeah this is a good suggestion. As lazyypieceofcrap says, would be a good suggestion on the iRacing forum. 

Another common complaint is not being able to test drive cars before purchasing them."
"Setups, cars, tracks"
U have to buy this amazing giant race ingeneer headset !!! Or it's just don't make any sense !
Having to buy the content just to spectate a friends race is pretty ridiculous imo.
"If you want to crew chief for a team/driver you need the car that team/driver uses, not just any car. If you just spectate you can't see the black boxes or set pitstops. 

You also don't have the ""start spotting"" option when you are spectating. Without that you will always be a second or so behind, which is a bit of problem if you want to call out situations to the driver."
You should go put it in the suggestion section of the official forums. It's a good idea.
I have at least one friend who would love to do this
"Not a bad idea. We currently have people ""graduating"" to real life racing from the sim. Maybe we could have the next big sports announcer through here as well. I have one single paid voiceover commercial under my belt and that dream of getting the voice out there is still kind of alive. 

A spotter account doesn't seem to have a lot of downsides but I'm sure someone else might have an idea of how it may not work. Cheating angle? Opening this avenue may take away from somewhere else in the business sense?"
"Honestly this is a spot on idea. Maybe a slightly higher subscription fee to account for no content purchases, but banger idea!"
Seems like a massive waste of money to not even race
It's literally in the title bro lmao. He wants to be a spotter. What's hard to understand about that? An alternative reason to want a similar deal would be a broadcaster
But you are. When the server is down for maintenance it’s test drive time.
"Unless you abuse it, iRacing will basically always give you a refund if you ask for one when you try a car and find you don't like it"
Why would you need setups just for spotting? lol
"It's probably majorly because they didn't think anyone would want a subscription just for that, and possibly because you're still able to drive a car in spectator mode. You're invisible to everyone else and can't touch them, but you can drive with them"
"While i agree , they probably did that because u can drive as a ghost in the race you re spectating too ."
I think you'll find few people care.
Yea I wish they would make the races avail to spectate for anyone for free…. It would honestly be great advertisement for them lol
Ok go spectate your friends forza race? Like what other platform even offers spotting and checking in to live races of any level from noobies to pros to roam or ghost race with? It’s a perk for those who are part of the community of iracing. It would be ridiculous to let random people into their environment who don’t even play the sim wouldn’t ya say?
"I am very new to iracing. I didn’t know there was one lmao

I guess on the website?"
"A buddy of mine has multiple accounts to spot with, I didn’t realize he had to own all the shit though to do it 😳"
"I don’t see how cheating would play into it as it would be no different from a spotter with a regular subscription. 

Honestly I see almost no flaws other than they wouldn’t make as much money versus someone that buys all the content to spot. However, that could also be seen as potential lost revenue because someone that wants to only be a spotter likely doesn’t want to invest heavily anyway."
"I do wonder about it being used for low-cost abuse. If folks are flippant enough to have their $$$ accounts banned for abuse, I’d think this would be an even easier route to that. Not that it should be a show stopper for implementation, but something to consider. 


From an Event Organizer’s perspective, it would be a boon for private events to have low cost “camera” accounts for production value. 


Id think a real name and CC similar to the main account would prevent a large percentage of possible abuse, but we’ve all heard and seen drivers go over that line even with those measures in place."
"I'm not sure how spotters work but having that 3rd person chase cam up while you race would kind of be cheating. Then again what's to stop that now, just have two accounts and two machines up and running the same race?"
"If you're interested in other forms of gaming, the big esports competitions often have full-time commentators.

In speedrunning there are also races and tournaments going on daily, but it's a smaller community so it's mostly volunteer, I've never heard of someone getting paid for commentary in that space. But like, if you would enjoy commentating races of A Link to the Past Randomizer, that's a good community with tons of races being streamed every day. :)"
"I’ve been on racing for 6 years and I never used a spotter outside of the Daytona 24. Even then they were just hanging out and not really spotting. 

Very few people only spot and don’t race. Like literally maybe a handful. It’s probably too much work for iracing to do to make the smallest group of people happy."
It’s literally a racing game bro. Obviously I know he wants to do it bro. I’m asking rhetoricaly why anyone would want to pay for the game just to watch other people play.
"Yeah, because everyone is home when they do maintenance /s"
Not in the first season that the content drops.
That's nice but if we could simply test drive first that would alleviate any issues. If they really cared they could limit the session length or something.
"Yeah. Since you can’t drive in spotting mode it shouldn’t require the car though, just the track. In spectating mode it makes sense since you can"
Why are you so butthurt bro? I love iRacing and do not play Forza. Me wanting to spectate a friends race which I do not own the track yet is a perfectly reasonable thought. Kindly fuck off!
"No, I would not say…"
"If you have the UI open, the left hand menu bar the last section is a URL link to the forums (forums.iracing.com)"
He's probably not using them to spot. Just smurfing. 
"I think it should be a child to a parent full iracing account 

If the spotter gets banned somehow, the main gets banned too

Now we have the same insurance policy of the user losing all of their paid shit if they get banned"
"Hadn't thought of that, thanks for the suggestion!"
Well that’s a more specific different complaint..
Feel like they should add a spotter subscription for esports and league tournament organizers.
"Ah misunderstood. In your case, yea it would be nice to spectate at least without having the track. I assumed you meant for outside third parties who are not members in any capacity. That would be strange to me."
Just buy the track 
Ty ✌️
He uses them for friends to race on (he has multiple sim rigs) but also for friends to spot for him as well as far as I understand
"While they don't seem to advertise them, they definitely have something not dissimilar for display set ups."
Glad we could agree on that.
Let me know when you posted it so I can support it.
Seems like he's hovering the line of breaking the sporting code for account sharing. As long as his friends aren't joining officials on his accounts. 
"Nope only private races for sure. It’s meant to be for like. Non racing friends to race together and stuff

Also this is how he got me to build a sim rig and sign up for Iracing and jm sure I’m not the first he’s recruited 😂

If anything he’s an iracing ambassador with a private arcade for demos"
"It's not that bad once you get into an actual race, if you're in a decent split.

Race your race and you can avoid the spins pretty easily. Wicked fun track, imo."
"This is how an Arca schedule should be. IRL they race everything from Talladega to Mid Ohio to DuQuion on dirt all they way to the tiny Berlin (pictured). It's like asking why Monza would be on an Formula schedule.

https://preview.redd.it/2tg0hj1ejcec1.jpeg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfee3740475a054841cd48d56f81c441f915b0d6"
"I moved from rookie up to ARCA two weeks ago, with Nashville (short track), Montreal (road) and now Concord as my first three races. Could not have done that at a worse time lmao, at least I know the car really well now."
"Dude I was just in the practice for this LMAO. Pulled my registration around 840. No one was going straight. I had a few spins initially and dialed it back, but as it creeped towards 8:45 it became a lobby full of whiskey throttle hell bent death race madness. I was loving it but sure as hell not racing it. Felt like an arcade game."
"Bit like Street Stock at Langley then, absolute madness."
"Jumped in this race without any expectations (or practice lol), just grab some SR, I'm a road guy. Man I had some of the best racing on Oval I've ever done. 3 way battle for 5th for like 70% of the race. Amazing 9/10."
I definitely hear you. It is a very tough race to avoid incidents with that being said. I managed to do a race going from p20 all the way up to p5 or so with a 0x. My next race also could have been with a 0x but I had a car literally blink into existence inside my car lol.
"I don't have any money right now to buy new content so my option was ARCA at Concord for oval this week. I turned about 10 practice laps, absolutely not lol. I worked very hard to get my iRating where it is, I'm not throwing it away on this fustercluck track."
I did the same thing I ended up quiting after like 30 laps. Maybe we were in the same race! 😆
I turned some test laps last night and quickly got out of the practice session lol
"Yup, I raced last night and it was excellent. Just keep your eyes up to avoid wrecks. 

“Death and carnage” is a skill issue."
"Does ARCA ever have more than one split? Whenever I run it, it's one split with my slow ass in there with actual NASCAR Arca/truck drivers occasionally."
Berlin! I actually went to the ARCA race there last season. Other than 75% of the field being non-competitive it was a great race with a late pass for the win.
Stop it you're scaring away the road guys that only want to sit in draft trains at superspeedways
Yeah... You picked a hell of a time to jump in.
"What's hilarious to me, is I'm pretty sure a 0x with this car/track combo was the race that fast tracked me to D license back in the day. Could have been a different track, but I'm almost positive it was Langley."
"You’re not “throwing it away”, if it goes down it’s because people are better than you"
"Think it depends on the time of day. Three splits for the race I did yesterday. Unfortunately I ended up in the top split with people with over 4k rating. I'm at 1.5k, so was ranked 21 out of 22."
I don't think I've ever seen ARCA go below three splits outside of like 4am EST. And even then it'd have to be a really unpopular track. It's one of my go-to series when I'm working nights and staying up late to flip my sleep schedule.
"ARCA is pretty non-competitive outside of the 3 or 4 Venturini entries.  And they have a generally prescribed running/finishing team order.  

Overall, ARCA isn't very competitive but it's cheaper to run than Trucks.  A lot of the drivers that would be running ARCA a few years ago are now spending daddy's money to wreck out in Trucks."
"I got to do the SRX race there last year and it was a great time, too"
Concord is the oval that races most like a road course and that’s why I like it
Have you not seen Arca at Concord?
Was it the 10:45pm EST race? If so i was in your split as car 22 lol
You would probably like Auto Club in the cup cars this week!
"No, about 7 hours earlier! 8:45pm Irish time, so 3:45pm EST I think that is."
Hell yeah my body is ready.
"HEAVY RAIN > SUNNY > HEAVY RAIN > SUNNY

Time progression = max

Sounds like a lot of fun to me"
where snow
Really want them to implement real time weather for endurance races. So you can use real life weather predictions. That was something so awesome about rfactor2 leagues.
I am moist... no wait the track is moist!
"I'm surprised ""Random"" isn't an option for each block"
![gif](giphy|yx400dIdkwWdsCgWYp|downsized)
Cool. Please just make rain available in 6 weeks for the next season.
"&#x200B;

"Has there been any word of rain tires? If there will be different compounds to select during a pit window such as slick, inters, wets?"
"I'm glad they're only rolling it out on a limited basis. That way, when everyone realizes racing in rain sucks, they only screw up a couple series instead a bunch of them."
[deleted]
"If you want to play with this today, get AC + Sol + CSP :)"
This is really cool.
24hr of Nurburgring when the rain hits is gonna be wild. Especially at night.
When are they thinking of releasing it?
Finally we can have the authentic Daytona experience
Sounds like a regular day in Florida
Standard summers day in Germany.
Soon ™️
It shows on the Instagram post that you can set it to like realistic forecast where it uses normal weather variations of each track
"If you want to truly simulate racing formula cars in the rain, combine iRacings Tempest Weather System with our Patent Pending Haptic Hydromatic Oscillating Ultimate Rain System  aka HHOURS (tm). Simply attach the high flow valve to your nearest faucet and arrange the durable multi ply tubing so that the rain pattern dispenser falls onto you as you simulate your way around a very wet Spa, or a constantly changing Nurburgring!  Now YOU can be just as wet as the track!  

HHOURS is not responsible for water damage to your simulator (including Rig, seat, other peripherals such as hand brake systems, your PC, Console or home including carpet, walls or other appliances."
"There's probably an option for overall random weather. If you're splitting your session into weather timeblocks, you likely want very fine control over the conditions."
Ams2 has this.
Of course there will be wet weather tires :)
"The November 2023 development update said the rain tyres will be on a select few cars to start with and later rolled out.

Likely candidates are GR86, F1600 and Ferrari 296 GT3 (Ferrari challenge)"
Don’t let the door hit you on the way out! 
The same people who say this would also complain if it was feature incomplete or badly implemented. Just wait so they can get it done right.
6 weeks to wait. It was meant to make it in this season but just wasn’t finished in time.
"Lmao, and race against who?"
"2 weeks! As they say with DCS and show the Total Recall .gif dont have the right one but this will do ... Just watch the movie.

![gif](giphy|iK7wLfAcmB5Ic)"
Yeah that's close but still can't use a real life weather forecast. I just got spoiled.
Had me in the first half not gonna lie
Will HHOURS account for the size of the Nurburgring and its micro-climates? Will it allow for rain on one part of the track and scorching hot sun to dry me out on another?
Inb4 someone makes a waterproof fully enclosed rig with a reservoir at the bottom and full sprinkler rain and wind and HVAC system
"Dude its super simple in real talk just have wind in SimHub and then have an option to add mister when it rains. Obviously its an outside toy though maybe just occasional shots of mist or something.

If they do that they need like shots of skunk air bc thats the realism I'm missing ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)"
"Or I could just piss my pants, like I normally do."
"Granted, but imo if this configurator is designed to fine tune your session exactly how you want it, an element of randomness should totally be something you should be able to do"
"Well one thing iRacing currently doesn't have - unless I'm missing it - is different tyre compounds, so although it seems very obvious that wet and intermediate tyres need to be added, let's not count on it just yet......

Edit: obviously this is incorrect and I didn't know, seev the replies below"
That's good to hear! Thanks
"Where do you think I'm going? You honestly think rain will be loved? It won't. It will be absolutely hated and derided.

Sure, a small number will actually enjoy it. But they'll be the minority. The kids with mom's credit card and enough time to pour 40+ hours a week won't mind. Some more, especially here, will pretend they don't utterly loathe it, but you'll see the cracks when they talk about it and slowly acknowledge and accept more and more criticisms. 

Most will absolutely hate it. Most users don't have a ton of time to drive and will complain about not being able to just jump in and run their favorite series/races because they don't have time to learn tracks twice over, especially with a random chance of rain where they don't know which ""version"" they're getting from one race to the next, or longer races where they'll have to deal with it off and on throughout. 

They'll hate that races turn into even bigger wreckfests. You think T1 is bad now? Just wait until it actually becomes like driving on the old grass model.

Rain won't be in public lobbies six months before iRacing quietly disappears it. And that's not even considering iRacing doesn't get it right. I actually have faith they'll create a great system. It's just not a system the majority of racers will want or like."
It is feature incomplete. It’s only going to be on a few cars at release
"I knew this would bring the downvote patrol, lol. Never said ""nuttin bout racing boy"""
"I imagine it would not be particularly challenging for a third party tool to exist to set the weather in the same way. I bet something like that will be along when weather gets here. 

Especially if in hosted races weather can be dynamically changed with commands. Then the third party tool needs to just fire off a command when the real-world weather changes."
"Scorching sun feedback requires separate purchase of the Scorching Overhead Lithium Air Racing Dryer, aka SOLAR-D"
"It’s a great idea and totally should be how it works, but they’ll most likely only see your suggestion if you post it on the official forum."
Several cars have multiple tire compound options including the Indycar and modern F1 cars
"I think I don’t care about anything you just said. It’s a game. And it’s racing. Wrecks happen and SR and IR are meaningless numbers in the grand scheme of my life and my enjoyment of iracing. Rain is a thing in real racing. I’d like it in my simulator game as well. Considering I grew up racing motocross in rain, sun, and snow and actually wrecked things that cost money and limb, I don’t give two fucks about rain in my video game. Bring it on and I can’t wait for the challenge. The fragile little flower pedals that can’t handle a little weather don’t belong here. GT7 or Forza Horizon is probably better for them and I love those games, no shade thrown. 

If public lobbies terrify you to that extent then may I suggest league racing or ovals? 

You have options. Stop trying to shit on a good thing. "
I would say that's more of a partial rollout than a missing feature. Feature incomplete to me would be like no water spray or something.
"*Tries to flex rain being in other racing game*

*Gets pointed out nobody plays other racing game*

*Whines his flex failed.*"
"Oh, you all can't seem to drive clean?  Fine, INSTANT RAIN STORM!"
Love me some Solar D
Real talk too probably be able to add it with SimHub using wind and heat up the air ... Probably pull air from the back of your computer and for cold use air from peltier from a $50 mini fridge.
"Sorry, I didn't know. I mostly race GT cars and never came across multiple tyre compounds in any car I've driven"
"Cry harder.

Rain will be gone as quick as it's introduced."
"I mean the original argument to 'just get AC with mods' so you can experience what Tempest will bring was a bit silly, but to say no-one plays AC is also simply not true.

With all the mod work that's gone into it over the years and most recently LFM adding AC to their service it's had the highest concurrent and peak players since it was released 10 years ago. While the tyre model etc is a bit outdated, the feeling of driving the cars and FFB are still some of the best in sim racing today."
"you must not speak english as a first language.  I meant play with the weather planner, not play iracing with weather.. just a small jib at the fact that people are so up in arms about the whole rain thing, and judging all of it before it's even released, if you want to go see what scheduling weather is like in races, there's several options out there.."
No worries!  It’s relatively recent (past 1-2 years). For the record I didn’t downvote you lol
"You're right. I should have said ""nobody plays it *with the weather*"" or something along those lines. But in my defense, a good snarky response needs to be short and snappy and not get lost in the weeds.

Regardless, I'm not taking the piss out of the game, just the poster who tried to flex something that's largely ignored."
This. I was on AC LFM last night whipping the Mazdas around limerock with about 15+ other people in the practice session at ~1030pm EST. No different than any non gt3/Rookie series participation on iracing.
"Tempest is a bit more than a rain texture on you're windshield and a schedule.

This is exciting because it puts us a little bit closer to the release of all of Tempest. we're not over-excited meteorologists who can't wait to schedule rain."
"Ha, fair enough! I may have gone a bit overboard with my response, apologies!"
We don’t know yet but it’ll be better than anything recent I’m sure. The dirt racing game they developed is… above average. Not my cup of tea but much better than recent games before it
"I would expect it to be more broadly appealing than iRacing. It’ll be based on the underlying iRacing tech; including accurate cars and tracks. But I’d expect it to be easier to drive with far more assists and a simpler physics model. I expect the online multiplayer to basic open lobbies. 

It wouldn’t make a great deal of sense for it to be like iRacing; because iRacing is already like iRacing and has plenty of NASCAR content. 

My best guess is the game is going to be like the F1 games from Codemasters back in the day; but NASCAR. That is to say; a simcade style, controller friendly game with lots of customizability and probably a decent career mode. 

I don’t know anything the rest of us don’t know though; so it’s all a guess based on what has been shared thus far."
Turning left?
If u play I racing at all now I would expect handling kinda like that. Just a lot easier to drive on controller . Honestly with the new over refresh there doing I racing might be very promising for nascar.
"[I started drinking at 6am, we're here now an I don know what time it is, but I'm rollin deep and those cars are going real fast and real left son, they're going fast and left, FUCK YEAH, YEEWWWWWW](https://youtu.be/8q0y3xMR54o?si=68QyoxOGNVq4wJdw)"
"I would assume an upgraded version of NR2003, I just wondering after 20+ years if they will have figured out how to put a save game feature in. Hopefully, it has Trucks, Xfinity, and Next Gen, series included."

If I read your post correctly you want to learn to be fast in NASCAR 2025 in advance so you ask us for as much information as possible because we are the best iRacing players in the world?
Bold assumption.
"Ugh. This tired and exhausted line hasn’t been true for several years. 

NASCAR has made significant improvements to the cars and the current generation cup cars are very advanced. 

They’re solidly late 90’s cars now."
"I didn't do the 24, but did do the VRS Endurance race the week before and had that same crash so many times in practice trying to run as little wing as possible.

Everyone I talked to always made a big deal about the bus stop, so I was super careful about it and almost never had any issue outside of testing alternate lines, but the dogleg bit me so many times."
"Not nearly as stupid as forgetting to pit! Dropped from P6 to dead last.

Luckily we managed to finish back 6th though. Top 5 was too quick anyway. But yeah I felt so fucking stupid."
That corner can be very tricky on cold tires. I always let off the throttle in the first three laps.
"Pfft. I've done dumber. Like having my wheel cranked all the way to the left on a standing start. Green flag drops, I drop the clutch and promptly spin left into the wall and earned a meatball.

1st day was quite the learning curve.:joy:"
"Nasty crash. Good it worked out. What you think happened? Lifted to quick?

I’m fairly new to it and have a question - what class or IR you have to accomplish to participate in 24h endurance races?"
Even the pros doing the real thing end up finding that wall. At least two cars had an off at that corner for the Daytona qualifying on Sunday.
"Yep I too did this in the VRS endurance race. I was thinking to myself ""wonder if I went wider on exit and hit the outer kerb, how would it feel"". Why I thought to do this mid race, idk"
"Yeah I was also being careful at bus stop, I started doing it EXTRA careful after I wreaked at lap 3xx, where I got once again forgiven by iRacing Gods and had no more than 2 mins of repairs"
"Yeeah hahah I think iRacing need an indicator for this, like Assetto Corsa has"
"I got distracted on my thoughts for a second and went too wide, rear right tire touched grass aaand I lost it haha

> what class or IR you have to accomplish to participate in 24h endurance races?

You just need to be C class, and you need to create a team with minimum 2 drivers. That's all!"
"On one especially gnarly wreck I ended up in front of the restroom building behind the RVs. It then became the running joke that I was only doing it for it for the toilet break.

I ended up adding a bit of wing before the race. I couldn't trust myself, especially on longer runs when the tires got a bit worn or later in the race when it got harder to hold focus, that I wouldn't fuck it up. I did pretty good. Was a lap down in the top ten. Then the sixth place car on the lead lap decided three wide into turn one was a spectacular idea and wrecked is all out."
And how did that afected your car? Got really bad damaged or it was still drivable?
got it thanks. I am a class c now. saw a dude finishing 24 all alone. Wonder how that’s possible
"I was gutted because I missed all the lap one chaos, only to get taken out by a car rejoining on lap two. Had to pit for repairs but made my way back out and actually was making some decent ground, til I made this dumb mistake haha"
"Unfortunately I hit the wall in such a way that it shoved one of my wheels right in, so had a long wait in the pits"
"You can do it but you will be DQ at the end so you will lose iR, the proper way is to do it with a team. 

Also racing 24h by yourself is insane, don't get me wrong it's a big achievenent, but it's dangerous for you and for the others drivers on track"
Happens to the best of us. And the worst. And everyone in between
Feels bad man :/ Looks like I had some luck
absolutely agree. thanks. looking forward for new events

"Yo bro, my team are always looking for drivers if you want to come check us out! 

We dont care if you are fast all we care about is finishing races and having fun while doing it. I see your from italy we have a few drivers already from there, i myself currently live here. 

https://discord.gg/Gpg2Fsct"
"Okay, I will join soon!
Thank you very much!"
Hey if you are looking to join a permanent team join the discord on my other comment on this page we would love to have you!
"Im considering joining a Team for Bathurst 12hr! Thing is, i may be a new dad at any minute now. Could i be on the backburner tho?"
"Yes, off cause. We have crazy dudes like me, we will go 4 persons to Bathhurst 24h (we will go in first and 3th time slots), we have people who go for fun, they preparing to event, but nobody be wild and shit talking if you make a crash. At this moment people who go to SE make some practice and at last week we just decided on teams by pace/available car.

We all have our real life, ages from 16-40, if you can race, you race, if you have more important things outside of iRacing, you are do this important thing."
Use your rearview mirror to see the incoming missile and don’t turn in until they shoot past you
"If you're on the inside of T1 with a standing start, you want to be *all the way* to the inside. You're going to give up a little time through that corner, but everyone is badly grouped up. Everyone is going to lose a lot of time through that corner."
"For starters it's tough man so don't dwell too much on it. 


1) Be clear and confident about your intention and make sure it makes sense. If I'm in that white car just off your left rear I would be in 'he's gonna wreck' mode. You're not passing or defending, you're in the middle of the track with a relatively quick and tricky right hander coming up on cold tires.  

Get in front of that white car and claim the line into the corner. It's yours for the taking so take it and be clear about it. 

Notice how everyone who is on the racing line got that through that corner and those in the uncommitted space didn't. 

2) Leave room for error(s). That track as a wonderful amount of runoff which the white car to your back left and green/red/blue car in front was able to use. You can even see guys further up the grid running wide either out of respect for the inside line or error but either way they got through clean. 

3) Bind the virtual mirror to a hot key and drive the first few corners with it up and positioned in your line of site. They tell anyone the first time doing a track event always 'look up' or 'look ahead' as far as you can. Your brain can processes a ton and will be able to pick out a car coming into focus in that mirror and disappearing down your right while you sight an apex and brake point.  "
Hindsight says watch your mirrors for that guy coming way too fast and don't turn in to him. I don't normally say start from the back because when I tried that I will got wiped out from a fellow backie who dipped into the grass and flew straight into me. So even then you're not immune. It's a rough game sometimes. I do decent-to-good when I don't get wrecked so it can be frustrating being at the mercy of other drivers.
"They were absolutely not clear of the white car. There was no being on the racing line. Could've been closer but it didn't matter, nothing dangerous about OP's line for lap 1. None of this clip was OP's fault."
If people that don't even know the track are qualifying ahead of you. You should probably look at yourself before you start getting mad at them.
"Even out of a bunch of professionals, drivers wreck their cars every year during the real Nurb24. Shit happens. Get used to it."
You should be focussed on improving things you can control like your accident avoidance and risk assessment skills.
"Entitled wiener thinks he doesn’t make mistakes, shock"
"If you’re routinely crashing into drivers that don’t keep the “racing pace”, maybe stop hot lapping and learn some race craft?"
"I'm 3k iRating, have done the Nürburgring 24h without crashing, even did a 7 hour stint with only 1 offtrack.

I still crash there every once in a while and am massively (actually massively, like 10 seconds a lap) off the pace for my iRating. 

So I should just go fuck myself and not do the race?"
"Even if everyone on the grid knows the track, that is not a guarantee. 

Welcome to online racing."
"Everyone starts somewhere and some people do jump in to race before they should but it's better they jump in then never at all. Also people make mistakes, they get their brake markers wrong etc that's racing.

I'm pretty sure if you found the lobby that you think is ideal you'd be back here complaining that you're only mid pack and never winning. If you're finding yourself behind people in lobbies where people don't know the track then that says a lot more about your driving than it does theirs."
Am I allowed to practice learning the track online or is that agaist your little wishes too?
" Ah yes, typical reddit hive mind comments, how wonderful 🙏"
came here to say exactly this.
"No, it’s everyone else who is the problem!"
"This is how I approach the Nordschleife as well, never once have I lost ir there."

Not sure what you’re trying to achieve? Would you like to go head to head on the Nords to see who crashes first? I know where my money goes lol

">I can’t seem to break this ceiling

Well, the ceiling is constantly moving depending on your iRating so that's probably a big part of why"
"I'm not sure but when you figure it out, you should let Pérez know."
"using a telemetry software can help

VRS (paid) or Garage 61 (free) for example."
"So honestly I don't think your qualy pace is the issue IN GENERAL. I feel pretty comfertable in a top 5 start, unless for some reason im in the only split and the crew chief kindly tells me im about to get pounded. 

Consistant p3-6 qualy is a great place to start, I think you need you embrace some race pace fun. 

Focus on mental fights, teasing the car in front of you every corner, really FEELING the race out throughout every lap. Make sure you are getting your tow's, not losing momentum if the guy in front is trying to break your tow etc. 

My thinking is if you qualified first you would have the same challenges that you have now essentially. 

The other side is series stats. Under the rookie mx-5, switch to the stats tab and start looking at the other races. See what the qualy lap is for the split right above and below. See what the people around you have for average laps etc. Essentially always be looking for how you compare to others in your split and the other splits you might move too etc."
"Neutral steering, trail braking and using as much of the track limits as you can at corner set up, apex, and corner exit. Trying to maintain the highest average speed through every corner throughout the track."
"To break your duck there’s a few things you can do:

0.) if you don’t have all racing lines turned off, turn them off now and never turn them on again.

1.) if you’re not finishing races with ZERO incident points your main focus needs to be on racing clean.  This means more than just stop trying over aggressive moves.  It’s mostly about spacial/self awareness.  It means recognizing when someone else is driving past the limit.  Things like staying out of their way when they’re going to try and out brake you but then end up sending it too deep.  Once you’re fully aware of how other people are driving you’ll be able to manipulate them into making mistakes that will allow you to pass them.  Moves like pretending to try and pass on the outside of a corner only to actually pass them 2 turns later on the inside line because they lost time trying to defend a move that never would have stuck anyway.  Most of your passes are going to come from your opponent momentarily losing focus or you setting them up multiple turns ahead of your actual pass attempt.  

2.) Go drive other series.  The F1600 and Formula Vee series are great for better understanding how mechanical grip works (this will help understand what the point of trail braking is and how to properly load/unload the front tires during cornering).  Go race some GT4 races to feel more speed.  The MX5 will feel a lot looser after doing other series but you’ll feel like your decision making has sped up vastly which will make you smoother with your inputs and thus faster.

3.) stop comparing yourself to your split.  Start comparing yourself and mentally competing with the split above you.  

4.) keep your focus on being smooth.  Quick, jerky motions are almost never the fastest way to do something.  

5.) start practicing laps before you ever watch a track guide YouTube video.  

6.) experiment with different lines during practice sessions.  Take an early, mid and late apex on every corner (in varying combinations).  This will help you manipulate others into making mistakes or help you set up those multi-turn overtaking moves I was talking about earlier. 

7.) practice your trail braking on the test track that is just a big circle.  There’s some Dave guy on YouTube who has a pretty solid video about this.  Experiment with letting off the throttle at different speeds and applying or not applying the brake.  

8.) look up YouTube videos on how to change the game files so you can’t ever get to 100% brake force and avoid getting into ABS or locking up too much.  In a car like the GT3 Ferrari you might not ever need more than 80% braking in a lap but in the MX5 you might need 95% on the same track.  Just be aware that the car and track your driving will dictate what is an acceptable number for this.  

8.2) play with you wheel and pedal settings.  Find what suits the car you’re driving and your driving style best.  Tons of google searches for articles / forum posts and digging the depths of YouTube will help you find what’s best for you.  

9.) “watch” live races in the game from higher splits.  You can race/practice alongside as a ghost and try and mimic the leaders racing lines.  You’ll see them like you’re actually racing but they will never see you and you can collide with them.  

10.) keep watching YouTube videos for more than just track guides.  Lots of good info out there for many different levels of drivers.  

11.) the more races you get in, the better you’ll become under pressure (keeping tip #1 in mind of course). 

12.) if you’re still struggling to find extra time or compete for wins there’s always telemetry and online coaches like some people have already suggested.  If you’re one of those people who are just always itching to spend money to try and get an advantage an online coach/telemetry software is probably your best bet.  SimCube’s best gear won’t get you better lap times if you don’t understand the physics of racing or understand your own tendencies/weaknesses.  

13 (and possibly the most important).) Remember it’s a game and a hobby that is just for fun and it’s not life or death.  Enjoyment should come above winning.  Also, remember to get up from the seat every hour or so and take some breaks (they don’t have to be super long breaks, getting up from the chair and just walking to grab a glass for water will do wonders on its own) to stretch and drink lots of water.

Edit:

Here’s the link to that trail braking video 

https://youtu.be/WJ0cVQ0P864?si=S7egfrZpjOIqSalo"
"Coaching be it one on one or specific videos online and practicing those teachings. 

Suellio on youtube has a bunch of videos that I started going through again recently because of this same issue."
"The answer is always just “use more track”…

Beware falling into the telemetry trap, nothing about your throttle or brake traces will gain you a “second or two”. Fast guys are fast because they are driving the best lines, using the most of the track, carrying the most speed. Think about the difference in apex speed from someone using the entire track through a corner versus someone who’s afraid of the edges of the track. If you overlaid the lines, it’s as if you are driving an entirely different track. Telemetry is useless if you’re not “on the same track”"
Fixed or Open Setup?  I.e are you running Rookie MX5 or Advanced Mazda/PCC?
Try turning off automatic clutch aids.
"With the MX5 it's line, throttle application and lastly, brakes. Know that you're not going to find a second. You're going to find 1/10 of a second, ten times."
"Depends on your split, if you low/middle it’s easy, just garage61 compare telemetry, now if you top split….. that second off alien is just tough….."
I'm with you there. I'm usually 3-5 seconds tho. In a fixed setup class I can't push the car hard enough to gain the time without spinning the car out
Analyze every corner in vrs.  See which corners r your largest gap compared to their baseline. Then practice those corners in a test session using active reset till u nail it or cut down your deficit by at least 50%
I use telemetry to compare my laps to the laps in top split. I use Garage61 as it’s free and very effective.
Check Suellio Almeida out. He took so much time off me
Extra second or two?
"First, as you stated it's not equipment. Cam Ebben is the #1 miata driver and the fucker races on a G27 and a laptop (how I don't know).

But ultimately, trail braking and learning rotation is likely your biggest issue. 

I notice people have very sharp inputs in the mx5, think quickly hitting or lifting throttle, or sharply removing brake, this upsets the balance of the car.

The gas and brake once your finding the last 1-2 seconds turn less into a means to speed up or slow your car, but rather tools to manipulate the weight of the car to create more grip.

Ex. Dragging a tiny bit of brake, like 5% on turn in shifts more weight over the front end giving you more turn in.  It also gives more rotation utilizing the rear tires 100%, rather than hitting bad understeer using 100+% of front grip and 80% of the rear.

Learning more about this will help you immensely."
"The higher your iRating, the further down you'll end up tbh. That's why fun races matter more than placing. Sometimes you stagnant at a spot where you are always 5th-8th place."
"In GTE sprint this week, I've won a race by 1m+, finished P2 within 2s of the leader, finished P2 back 1m+, and finished 5th within 15s of the leader. Never crashed, no major slowdowns, all 4x or less. All similar SoF. There is a TON of variance, especially at lower iRatings. If you can give a 1.0 confidence factor to skill at iratings above 5k, you're probably looking at about a 0.5 contidence level at 1.5ish. life has luck and variance, we have to accept that. iRacing is no different. What happens tho, is with a large of volume of results, a trend appears, and you will notice that your average start/finish position and all that starts to make sense. "
"A win would be nice, but an increasing iRating is a good sign. If you’re consistently in 3rd or 4th and are increasing your iRating, you would have beat the guys you raced against weeks ago, assuming their skill stayed the same."
Thanks! I’ll look into it
"Can someone walk me through G61 use and setup. I used VRS for a month and it was great for learning. But $ just didn’t want more dripping. 

Happy to support the startup/player led co. But I’m not using it properly. Any guidance on use, I’ll take it"
VRS lets you do the rookie series for free
"The first time used VRS for MX Rookie on Little Rock. I gained seconds, got pole, and won my first race."
"This is really solid advice, thank you!"
Practicing trail braking has been helping a lot and a lot easier with a load cell. I’ve heard of neutral steering but may be something I need to look into as well. Appreciate the tips
"I'm not sure what you mean by neutral steering, I'll have to look into that, but one thing I noticed when I pushed a lap to my absolute limit in the MX-5 and couldn't go any faster, I checked my telemetry against someone faster and my steering inputs were way smoother than theirs, they were making loads of corrections throughout the corners which was probably how they were carrying more speed."
What is neutral steering?
Wow this was very thorough thanks for taking the time to write that I really appreciate it!
I’ll probably watch more of his videos again. I feel like I’m pretty quick around Oulton Park until I see a 1.52 lmao
"Not quite... While using the whole track is important, if you don't know how to extract that extra track with the throttle and pedals, you could EASILY be a second or two down. Trail braking could easily gain you at least a second or more a lap if you aren't using it now."
"No sure why you are being downvoted, I literally said the same thing in so many words. I don't use telemetry, being quick isn't something you learn from telemetry. It's something you feel, through your wheel, and visually if you are gaining on the guy who's in first place or pulling away from the guy in second you know you're doing something right."
"You can use telemetry to see where they are placing the car compared to you. 

You literally just explained a bunch of stuff that someone could check out with telemetry."
VRS shows all of that stuff in the telemetry.  You can see the line difference both on a track map and a 'distance from line' graph.
"I find this comment bizarre as well. If someone is braking later and deeper into the corner and earlier and smoother the throttle this can easily add up 2 seconds a lap.

You can’t really separate lines from driver inputs anyway. The reason why the fast guy can take the lines they do a lot of times is because their braking and throttle application is excellent. 

I agree that a lot of drivers should be focusing on actually driving than telemetry. Particularly if you’re well off the pace. 

If you have an hour a day to drive, and are spending a good portion of it looking at telemetry that’s a hell of a lot of seat time you’re sacrificing. 

If you’re constantly coming midfield in the top split of a popular series however telemetry is vital to catching the front runners."
Rookie MX5/Fixed setup! Not ready to be doing any open setup races yet
Yeah it’s definitely a good idea not to push too hard in a race. Every time I try a different line or something in a race it’s a disaster lol
"I got to look up this Cam Ebben guy, sounds absolutely insane. But yeah the more I drive the Miata it seems like the trick is in the rotation of the car, even seems beneficial for the backend to slide bit to keep momentum"
G61 was amazing for me. Took tenths off easily within 30 min first time I used it. Just make sure to filter for fixed setups (if applicable) and quality laps (so you're not comparing to a draft)
"Trophi AI works too, it’s what I just started using and it’s amazing. I just recently turned off the racing line for good(to vow to never punt someone again, it was a dark time). And I also started using trophi ai and it helps a lot but I can usually just see what I need to do based on telemetry but the advice really does work. For example I’m running low 1:53s consistently at oulton this week."
"I was struggling with trail braking because I had my load cell brake pedal set to not have any pedal movement. At first I was told that was the “proper” way, and then a sim racer who works for a GT3 team demonstrated how there’s abundant pedal travel in the real cars. So I felt comfortable adding pedal travel back in and trying it, and it’s so much easier to feel myself easing off the brake. Might want to try that if you have no pedal travel."
Every time I’m struggling to increase my pace it’s always due to my steering inputs in combination with how and when I’m using trail braking. I had that happen to my last night. My practice at in the 1600 series at Rudskogen I was able to hit a low 1:29 (1350 irating) then got to qualifying and could barely make a 1:30. Ironed out my neutral steering in combination with the right amount of trail braking I was able to get into the low 1:28s
"That my friend is neutral steering you are observing. Have you ever noticed if you turn your wheel too much in a corner it induces understeer? Or if you turn your wheel less it can sometimes cause oversteer? You’re in a sense trying to keep the wheel as straight as possible while making minor corrections. It takes a while to get used to and of course there are times when you turn the wheel more but “turning in” really comes from trail braking and NOT physically turning the wheel “in” a lot because the more we turn the wheel the more we induce understeer. Understeer kills lap times. 

https://youtu.be/H7g14l8kOKw?si=1hENfDaYIW6oGFjJ 

Check this guy out. He races pro (in real life) and on IRacing. He has a racing university but the video I linked explains neutral steering for free and demonstrates it pretty well. Showing you what the car is actually doing when your tyres are being pushed to the limit the right way.  Neutral steering essentially the lack of understeer and oversteer. It allows you to “keep the car on rails” and will give you the most accurate and efficient lines through the track, while pushing your tyres to the limit but not beyond it. To get the most out of your tyres you need to push them to the right slip angle. Almost as if they are drifting through the corner slightly. If there isn’t “slip” in your tyres then you aren’t pushing them enough.

Rodskogen is really good track to practice neutral steering this week in the fixed Vee and 1600 formula classes because to really eke out extra time you have to have the tires on the limit pushing as fast as you can on the racing line. Both cars are really easy to understeer with and oversteer with. To get the most out of the formula 1600 you pretty much have to learn neutral steering and trail braking because that MF tends to understeer but will easily spin you if you aren’t careful. Only after I started improving my trail braking in tandem with my neutral steering did I see my lap tim es consistently improve. Hopefully 🤞🏾 this helps…."
Just some ramblings from a man drinking bourbon after dinner.  Also it wasn’t long ago I was in the same boat.  Now I qualify on pole quite a bit and wins actually happen for me.  The original advice I was given was start every race from pit lane and protect my safety rating at all costs.  That was horrible advice.  I can have clean race easier at the front of the pack than I can from the back and it made me faster to compete at the front all the time.
Some of his paid stuff is all pretty good if you're willing to invest in it.
What’s your times look like? I said in another reply but I’m low 1:53s at 1700 IR so usually second split. And I’m also pretty competitive in the second split and setting fastest laps a lot but then I see top split times a second faster🤣
Yeah. It really is both. You can’t compare telemetry of an alien and expect to get the same result if you’re not driving the same line.
"Telemetry doesn’t teach you how to trail brake. But you’re right, I should have been more clear. Unless you have truly no idea what you are doing with your feet, you aren’t gonna gain that much time just by optimizing your traces.

You could gimp a pro driver with 70% maximum brakes and they’d still GAP like 95% of the service. There’s VRS telemetry drivers who use one foot"
"Yea most drivers are really at the point where they are struggling with basic car control and can’t connect to the car. Telemetry is there is for refinement and discovering subtle inefficiencies once you’ve already mastered the basics. Telemetry don’t teach u how to trailbrake even if it shows you 8ker brake trace, telemetry don’t teach you how or why the line is what it is even if shows you how many tenths of a meter off you are, telemetry don’t show you how or why some corners have different traces based on the track topography, could go on and on. It’s bait"
not using telemetry isn’t something to be proud about imo. it’s very helpful for those last tenths.
You don’t need to use telemetry to see that you are not hitting the apex or tracking all the way out
"If this was a post from a 5ker asking how to close the gap in top split then yea bro look at the telemetry. If you’re 2 seconds off pace at any combo, telemetry is not the issue. There is so, so, so much more to finishing high on the podium than your raw inputs. All I caution is to appreciate that and point to THE BIGGEST, BY FAR, area where noob drivers lose pace."
"Unless you are in top split then you are probably just at the approximate iRating you should be at.  You are around other similarly fast drivers in that split.  

Practice, time on track, and just overall good habits will help."
"Ultimately, you want to rely less on the front tires, and use all of the grip of 4 tires.  If you're understeer limited, you're using 100% of the front tires, but 80-90% of the rear.

By zero/neutral steering through a corner, you're using 100% of the grip of all 4 tires more, and creating higher theoretical limits of grip by balancing the weight between front/rear better.

The trick then is to turn your tire noise up, and engine noise down a bit so you can listen to the tires more.  Don't overwork the tires, don't keep turning when the front tires can't turn more.  That causes overheating and lowers grip levels, which causes more sliding and less grip...  


Suellio Almeida has some great videos too, he had one in a miata where it basically says think Turn in is a 1% turn in, and then counter/zero steer.  


They showed telemetry into T1 Okayama, the driver was 8% steering to the right, and 0-15% counter steering on corner entry under rotation until the apex, and then flat much eariler than you'd be without rotation because the car was pointing the right way so much sooner due to rotation.  

&#x200B;

Very big ""ahh ha"" moment figuring out that you literally turn more to the left than the right on a right hand turn (at least on entry under those circumstances)."
This. Also snag a ghost lap from a faster driver on similar track conditions.
Can you even adjust the fanatec csl load cell pedal like that though?
"I had a feeling that was what it was, I just hadn't heard the term neutral steering before I'll check that video out, thanks."
"Ehh. I'm 3k irating, and my entire last second or so to the VRS times comes from the braking phase. The coaches can brake later and smoother to keep the car stable for a proper exit. You can absolutely see that in telemetry if you don't have enough experience to feel it. Mine is the difference from 3k to aliens, whereas the difference between let's say 1350 and 3k is even more visible.

Next to that, there is steering input, too. This is also something that telemetry can show. Many new racers steer way too much for too long. Opening the steering wheel asap has to be learned for most.

I do agree about using the track, though. For most rookies, that's for sure where most time gains can be made. But this will most likely be the gain from off the pace to 1.5 or 2 seconds off. The last 1.5 to 2 seconds are details. 2 tenths per corner adds up rapidly."
Agree with you whole heartedly brother! As someone who once put up a top 23 time in S class in Forza Motorsport 5 Sebring school circuit; I didn’t brake through my ceiling and gain confidence until I started racing with the top 10 guys and spent hours hot lapping trying to catch their “ghosts”. Instant visual feedback on whether or not your technique works or it doesn’t.
"You talked about the lines and placement of other peoples cars and but don't actually use telemetry to see where that placement is? Seems like a waste of energy if you don't actually know what your aiming for.

Also where you want to apex and how much track you need on exit will change so much from car to car. 

You basically said a bunch a key words and gave little to no advice. May as well just said be faster."
"+1. If in rookies there’s way more to learn before trying to match aliens. I’m 3 years in and upper 3k irating, still chasing those aliens."
Hmm not sure. I have the Clubsport V3s. I see aftermarket solutions for the CSL that look similar.
There are mods
I heard the elastomers on 3DRAP are pretty good but never bought them. Considering again looking at this thread
"Same boat, I'd argue at this irating, we're doing the exact same line as Verstappen. I see perfect pedal control being the difference. Top guys corner in, mid corner, and corner out speed profile is melodic. Whereas (and im talking nanoseconds) I'll waver on my braking or get on the gas then off then back on, there's hiccups in the speed profile."
"Just hit 3k last night too! Woohoo! 😁 You can definitely learn how to trail brake properly with telemetry. For example, I was struggling with understeer on the exit of turn 14 of Suzuka last night. When I checked VRS and compared the brake trace, even though my timing of start and release was the same, I saw that the coach was braking around 5-10% more when trailing off right before the apex. Did that in the next race and boom, the car rotated like a champ every single time and I gained .2-.3 seconds through the next straight. Mind you I'm only 1% off the VRS time at Suzuka, so that .2-.3 seconds is huge! So in that case, I wasn't trail braking enough and figured that out through telemetry."
"Watch low elo drivers compared to high rated drivers, compare where their tires are at the moment of turn in, apex, exit. Pro drivers are always going to be driving a much wider corner, all the time. From a driver development perspective, your traces do not matter until you can overcome your fear of the track edges. It’s pretty common in coaching, I don’t really understand how this is so controversial. I guess everyone needs to justify their telemetry sub or something"
"For someone so against telemetry it's weird you are telling me to look at the telemetry of other drivers to improve.

It's not controversial I'm just pointing out that you said telemetry was a scam then suggested to go look at all the things telemetry can tell you."
"I’m not against telemetry at all, I’m not sure why you would say that haha :^] I am against noobs 2 seconds off lobby pace paying 15$ a month drooling over data from a 9ker being like “how can I make my numbers look like that”. It’s absurd, but I always need to understand that the average irating is 1250 so really I accept these downvotes. Eventually you will understand, though statistically unlikely random redditor"
"Weird not that far up you called it a trap and useless. 

Also you can look at telemetry for free if you wanted. 

Lastly i don't think you understand why you got downvoted."
"telemetry is useless FOR NOOBS, not in general as a thing."
"But your litterly telling people to look at driving lines through corners, Look at apex speed, look at braking into a corner and throttle out of the corner which will dictate those driving lines. 

All of which is telemetry which you say is useless for noobs but is also your suggestion for how people improve."

Wait, what? It wasn't already?

Did they seriously remove it from base content when it went legacy or something??"
Free Miatas !!!!
"I'm really happy to have the old mx-5s free, I'd always wanted an h pattern road car for showing people the sim."
Oh NOW they increase the torque on the 296
"`<Car Class> NASCAR Cup Series Next Gen Cars Vehicle artwork and textures have been updated to match the NASCAR 2024 Season.`

Woooooooooooooo"
Nice to see that they just updated the NextGen cars and didn’t make us buy the new model.
Over here still waiting on them to fix the Caddy's TC toggle and maybe a brake migration binding
So great they fixed the black water. Annoying when spotting at Tsukuba
"Yes they removed a bunch of legacy content from the free base content a few years ago. Glad they have put it back. 

If you joined before they did the removal you already had access to them as legacy."
I think it was an effort to prevent new subs from accidentally driving the wrong car to practice.
I'm fairly new so not sure about its history but it was the legacy price (around $3) yesterday when I was browsing the shop.
Roadster was $3 before yesterday I think
I just bought this a couple weeks ago lmao
"I'm looking forward to a blast on this, people who got me into iracing go on about how good this was"
I love Mt. Washington for that. Plus I drive a Miata.
I think people would get more impressed if you showed them the sim running AC with 2838183 mods on it. You can achieve almost high-end graphics with nice physics.
But will the existing paint schemes still work?
Holy shit that’s tough
I guess since it’s the same car they just had to change the shell and didn’t have to worry about changing the properties
when did they do this before?  They gave us the new tundra free previously.
"Interesting. I thought the lagacy content they made paid was all stuff that was originally paid content. Like silverstone went from paid to free legacy to paid legacy.

Weird that they started charging for the Mx5 for the first time *after* it was legacy and had been replaced by another free car."
I joined a month ago and had free MX-5
You should get an automatic refund hopefully.
"Ok, noted!"
"That's fair, and I typically do but there's a few things I prefer about iracing with regard to tracks and vr performance."
I appreciate the competition of other sims but assetto corsa is such a weird sounding name and I have no idea why you would pick it for a racing sim
"No. They don’t. At least for the Dark Horse. But I have yet to find someone with the accurate file, the one from iRacing is showing old decals"
"The Toyota sorta does - the sides behind the front wheel well, roof, hood, and decklid are fine.

Changes that will have to be made include the nose area (the top part has been added to the hood, and the lower part obviously has a different front grill), the rear quarter windows (they've been moved from the right of the hood to under the nose), and the TV panel (different taillight assembly, but you no longer have a separate part of the inset you have to paint!)"
Not the old one.
"Usually, they say that in the patch notes. I don't think that's happening this time."
"iRacing, rFactor, Automobalista (motorist), Assetto Corsa (race trim/setup), Gran Turismo (grand tour)


Why is that the one that sounds weird to you?"
Is there a series you can race the old one in
You can always reach out to customer service and ask about getting credited
"Sounds like corset or something lol. Don't worry I'm just being a typical ""dumb American"""
Not in official
Hosted sessions.
"I got a refund for a track when I first started, then I got them to refund the brasil stock car. 

I'll just take my $3 L"
Corsa is literally just Italian for race.
"I told my friend I play iracing.....his response was ""that's wierd, hiw to you drivecwith your eyes, like jist look around at where you want to go?""

I thought he was joking so I went along with it but then realized a few days later that he was still confused at how you racecwoth your eyes"
Got that SR tho
"That rig looks ""sketchy"""
"No wonder he is losing, guy can't reach the brake pedal"
"I always tell the wife “I’m off to wreck a $100k race car” I’m just happy now if I finish top 10. I will say I’ve had some awesome races this week in F4, the top qualifiers in the mid splits have been clean and damn competitive."
lol this is my iRacing life in a nutshell.
"Lol. I was having trouble with cold tire starts last week so I just put myself in an open practice and kept restarting to try to push it. So my 7 and 9 year olds just saw me wreck a LOT while looking for improvements.

Then the 9 year old comes back for the race and just points out EVERYWHERE I wrecked. Thanks bud, thanks."
This is hella relatable
Nice setup! You might wanna get a PC and some pedals next. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Me the Sunday. And my 5th year daughter tried to sit on my knees. I was able to convince her to not do that
Too real 😭
Charlotte Roval in GR86 is taking my irating like we're in the 4th grade and it's my lunch money. If I'm not loosing front end grip on the racing surface I'm getting yeeted into the wall by the pyramid curbs since my line was ever so slightly off. But man does that track produce some really fun battles especially into the back bus stop braking zone
"Bet your ass.

SR - A 4.99

iRating - 264..."
Here's the trick to winning every race: Join a rookie race and wait for everyone else to disconnect out of frustration. Then you cruise to the finish line and pop the champagne. 
Like a lounge chair at a crappy hotel from the 90's. Props to dad for doing what he enjoys though.
Oh noes not teh ‘flex’
"HUZZAH!!!! 


underrated comment."
Ayooo! Get em!

"This!!! I call it P10 racing, it’s been the best mental switch I’ve had in iracing. I count P10 as winning and anything better is a bonus. It takes so much mental strain away when your 4th and get passed and now your 5th….still way above target :). I hope your enjoying your racing :)"
All about having fun and the experience. Also letting the wife have time to herself.... lol
F4 Spa is always a blast to race
"I do the same except instead of p10 as a static target my goal is to finish at my number or higher, since numbers are in order of iRating."
"To be fair, iRacing is a lot cheaper if you just display a JPEG of the results screen on your monitor. Saves a lot of money and time."
I hate that car.
Safety first
"Joke goes ""whoosh"" right over your head"
I do the same! If im in the points im happy. I had a 1x 4th place the other day and i celebrated it like a win for sure
"LOL
On second thought, I am doubting that's even a real monitor!"
Just a picture of a results screen with a Walmart frame. Cheapest iRacing sub ever.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Get set up with Garage61 and compare some telemetry. The common culprit is overdriving into the corner. Too much entry speed and and too much steering input and you're just going to see the front tires overload and understeer. Oulton has a lot of corners that you need to set up your entry into correctly or you're just going to understeer off the track.
"I had a 17x last place followed by a 2x 1st place immediately after. Gotta trail brake aggressively with the fixed setup, use all the track, and blip aggressively into 1st on several corners."
"T1 is fast and all about getting a good, stable entry. You can use way more of the grass than you should for run off without a 1x, which leads to people chucking it in almost completely out of control and it shows. Focus on getting a good line on entry and you'll gain a ton of time.

T2 is pretty a standard ""not really a corner"" corner. Stay left out of T1, then transition right with the flow of the track. Once you cross the bump brake hard and trail brake into T3. Turn in a bit later than you think you should and try to unload the tires and use the inside curb. For as forgiving as the runoff at T1 is, T3 is the opposite and you'll feel like you barely have your tires on the edge getting while getting the 1x.

Try and take the shortest distance down the straight and just naturally let the car work itself to the left through T4. You can carry a lot of speed into the banked T5, just don't overdo it.

Slow down a bit extra until you get the feel for the chicane. It's the epitome of slow in, fast out.

For the Hislops chicane, aim as tight to the tires as you can and carry as much speed as you can. The key is that you stay on track and unload the tires so you can quickly move left for the right hander.

Stay hard in in the throttle after the right, hold your last up shift for after the hill. Druids is a double apex, so slow down, turn in late, get the first apex curb and full throttle across the second and let the car roll out. Again, the off track limit is super forgiving here.

There's a race control tower on the left, brake right around there, use the interior curb and throttle out as you cross the access road on the inside of Lodge. Full throttle through Deer Leap for the lap."
"Are you practicing against A.I.?  being a bit timid at oulton is going to cost you a lot of time, and its one of those tracks I feel like people outdrive their IR in a lot of cases, I've also never gotten a great result there, but I love the track, it's so much fun to drive.  I'm having the same struggle on charlottle roval, it's an odd track in the gr fixed setup, I got practice laps down to a time that should be decent for my split, but the races have not gone well at all, I'm just gonna race something else for the rest of the week."
"With Oulton Park, I've found that there are a lot of tricky corners where you need to turn at exactly the right time and steering rate or you miss your optimum line and lose time or go off. The biggest thing that helped me here (in addition to using all the track like others have mentioned) is setting reference points for EVERYTHING. Find your braking point that allows you to carry the right speed through the corner. Find your turn in point that is consistent and sets you on the right path. Find a point where you put on the throttle hard enough to just barely stay on the track at exit. The hard part here is that there aren't a ton of braking boards like at other tracks, you have to use trees on the side, permanent tire marks on the track, or weird blemishes on the fence as your markers. Look at everything and make sure it's consistent. Once you have all those down, you'll find consistently. This applies for all tracks, but Oulton Park seems to punish you harder if you don't have those down."
"Which layout?

Also... Oulton not Oultan."
You have to use literally all the track you can. It’s kinda difficult. Like turn 3 or 4 where it’s a really high speed corner that goes into that hairpin. If you hit the curb on that high speed turn it basically keeps you on the track. I’m still getting the hang of this track myself.
"One of those tracks if the first time you’ve raced it. 

You really have to cut a shit ton of laps there to be fast."
"thanks, i'll check them out"
"Which corners are you taking in 1st at this track? 

The only time that I consider 1st is at the last chicane on the full course (international I think it's called). Even then it's only if I want extra rotation on exit, which is incredibly perilous."
"What’s your pace? I’m running low 1:53s consistently and I agree with everything you said except the first chicane and druids. For the first chicane there’s a lighter spot in the middle of the track after turn in, and that’s where I brake every time. And I’m hopping the curbs and going super fast in but also don’t lose any time on exit. Druids I think for the first apex you don’t go all the way down and leave about a car width to the curb and then the second apex hit the curb."
"Some corners the track straightens out and that’s also a reference point for me, for example turn 3(I think?), bowl turn, and the last turn it straightens out after the “hills” and it’s something I noticed that works well."
It's at the International. I do not understand why they have been using this layout for slower cars the last couple seasons. The two straights are so fucking long and boring to drive. Island is perfect for the rookie and D class cars.
What’s your pace?
"Horseshoe roundabout (5 maybe?) The chicane following that, the next chicane, and the final turn. It is perilous but when you nail it, you'll immediately know it's a must for a hot time."
"I haven't run International for a hot minute, this is just from memory. With tire model tweaks you might be right on Druids. I know some track guides used to say avoid running the curb to avoid unsettling the car, but I want to say that was for Vees and not Mazdas, and you still wanted to get tight to it. 

For the first chicane I left it as more general advice because no matter what the car, I always see people struggling there and wanted to encourage safety over speed while focusing on a good exit for the straight."
"Yeah, it’s good advice but obviously safety won’t be the fastest way around the corner. Every single time I take that chicane it feels like ride or die, but I hit both curbs and I haven’t gone off in a race session but it sure feels sketchy."
"I honestly dont understand the mind frame of some people, i would rather finish last in top split and race against the best possible people instead of cheesing the system to try and get an easy win. For me the way i see it is the best way to get quicker is to be humbled and learn from the best."
"For those wondering, I did report them this morning after seeing this.  We finished P14 so another position would be nice!  


  
It is very funny tanking your IR and still failing to achieve a good position!"
Total loser. Everyone who does this is lame as fuck. Always report these people.
"Report them, they'll be disqualified"
Its always satisfying seeing someone who tanks not even finish well in the lower splits 😂
report them
"Why is he tanking when he's already in sub 1k sof splits lol, hard to get lower than that anyway surely"
"I don’t understand people with these fragile egos and mindsets. Ok great you lowered your rating so you could dominate people with less ability. Losers of life

This is like me as an adult turning up to a Kindergarten basketball game… dominating and bragging to my friends how well I did at my basketball game."
"That's a plague on the service...seems to happen for all the big events sadly...have been dealing with it at least since I started Iracing as a COVID joiner...sucks that it can't be policed, wish they could do something like send you to the highest rating of the last 6 months or something like that"
"Is it really tanking if you're going from 700ir to 400ir?  Based on those SOFs I assume this guy's irating was awful before the ""tanking""."
Imagine losing a race you scum bagged to be in.
"Fall in love with the process, not the results."
This is painfully common and protestable
The 'winners' in my team's split were protested and DQ'd for this.
"Lol what is the opposite of tanking? 3 of our 5 team drivers collectively gained over 600 rating during the Daytona week doing IMSA races, increased our overall average rating by more than 120, although we would have probably been in the same split where we ended up racing anyway."
"I race in LFM and I'm so slow it's not even funny.

And yet I'm not as pitiful as these guys."
"To everyone in my split I was not tanking my irating, I just had a really bad week in IMSA in which I got wrecked in turn 1 almost every race."
Protest it. They'll get DQ'd
No one was tanking anything.
The best way to combat this is the lowest IR on the team isn't counted towards the team IR. So a 4000+ driver with a 500 driver doing just fair share to gain an advantage would be impossible
"I have an even better one. Our race winners had a few +/- 4k guys and one brand spanking new account with only a handfull of rookie races (weren't even wins). Well guess what: the rookie C class 1xxx iRating did the fastest laps of all. The dick even boasted about winning (they were a few laps ahead of the rest) 

Naturally I protested but just got confirmation from iRacing 5 mins ago: you can't tank your iR but its perfectly good if you just get a new account with no rating and use that as a tanking mechanism (my guess, money)

So sorry in advance for the next special events but I guess this will be the norm from now on!"
I sadly had a mental breakdown during which if there was any contact that damaged my car I Alt + F4 out and do the next race. Kept happening so I kept Alt + F4 out of races (this is not me in the picture) sometimes the tanking doesn’t come from rational thought.
"Unfortunately, this seems fairly common. The GTP winner in my split had a driver at 600 setting 31's. In a way, I wish they would set a minimum iRating, but they would just drop to the minimum anyway..."
"I call them sandbaggers.
I learned about them racing motocross.
Race a lower class of riders win money and prizes."
If u feel the need to tank ir below 1000 and still fail at winning then i say you should find another hobby ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
"\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*  


They have been DQed."
iracing should have irating thresholds reached for events like d24 so even when they tank they will be put in splits based on the irating threshold they have reached.
"I think it's easier to brag about finishing top 3 or something in a lower split to someone that doesn't know the iRacing system. Which in turn makes them feel good about themselves I guess.

I don't really get it either..."
Some people don't think it's fun unless they are winning. Those of us that actually enjoy racing can still have a blast battling it out in the mid pack or even for 2nd to last
"These are people who chase accomplishments over experiences, and in this case they are too stupid to realize that their 'accomplishment' means absolutely nothing. "
"Yeah but when it's last on the 14th split or win the 22nd it's easy to think otherwise. 


Not many get into top splits"
Same people who play in lower leagues where I play hockey. They’re losers who don’t care about anyone else but them. I’ve been the best dude on the ice and the worst (more likely the case) and I’d rather play against people better than me every day of the week. I don’t get people that do that at all honestly. It’s pathetic behavior.
"The people you describe my friend are achievement and record chasers, they don’t race for the enjoyment of participation or to learn and get better… these kind of people get bored really fast and eventually move on to something else…"
"Exactly. This is why I hate new age skill based matchmaking games. If you never play against the best, you never learn"
I agree! There’s no satisfaction of the battle if you’re racing against people much slower than you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t8xwpW8gJQ
As iRacing gets bigger people's names are going to start getting doxxed because of this shit.
"It could be identified if iRacing invested in identifying the patterns and warning people who start to fit the pattern.

There’s lots of different things they could and maybe are developing. It would be cool to get more updates about some of these, but surprise and delight is great too."
"Not sure what his IR was before but there were further 0 participation races beyond this page.  Also, this racer turned up with an IR of.......  31!"
Big difference between having a bad week but actually participating in the races you signed up for vs. signing up and withdrawing as soon as race servers open and tanking your irating
"same. I lost like 280iR just imagining myself finishing an imsa race at daytona with both bumpers still attached. the -.79SR hurts worse for me, though."
They have been!
Ok
"> (my guess, money)

Ding ding ding!"
"same. I ended up in F4 practice at Spa over the weekend on some ""new year, new me"" shit, thinking that this was just the universe telling me to finally start racing open wheel."
Id say the people that aren't on iracing probably also don't care how well you do in a virtual racing game.  I have told coworkers about my Daytona 500 races and they just think I'm weird to do a race that long
"exactly.  normally there are a few people making poster or frameable prints of their 24hr ""win"" when its 9th split or similar.  i dont really get it"
"I get it, but I don't get it. I've never been fastest, and honestly don't try to be. I race whoever's in front of me, then the car in front of that one. splits be damned, I just wanna finish the race I'm in. it's a win if I place better than where I started and didn't fuck up the car or someone else's race. now it's nothing if I didn't do it in the top split?"
"Newbie with a class D license here and only 1150 irating so VERY new.

How do I know what split I'm in when I get registered for a race? And this is likely a question with a dynamic answer, but in general what kind of SOF do the top splits run? 

In theory a top split is all A license? But if a race magically only had 200 rookie Miata drivers then the top split would be like 800 something?"
that part.
"Seeing how almost every race I'm in has people battling in turn 1 and wrecking race after race, I don't think they're capable of learning shit."
"not true. I learned from many of the turn1 torpedoes I've beaten simply by keeping all the wheels on the car for the entire first lap. I treat them like road signs that warned me of the fuckery ahead. then behind, because I passed them. 14th is better than DNF any day."
"Yeah, and I can't tell you how many times I have finished second to one of these people that leeches down to lower splits just to come in and destroy the low ones...thinking of one time in particular, had a 6 second lead at Iowa in NASCAR trucks...only one problem...dude that hovered around 4-6k was in my race and was only at 1100 for some reason...claimed he kept having disconnects when confronted about it from my spotter in the next session. Yeah ok bud.

Now that I'm right at 2k and stuck there, I'm lucky to get a top 10 most of the time with my setup.

Just a minor rant. But yeah, they seriously need to do something, it's going to cause people to stop racing eventually I fear."
I guess I'm confused why he would do this.  At a low starting IR he'd be in the bottom split of most every normal series.  And in the D24 I can't imagine there is much of a difference between the 20th split and the 22nd.  Just doesn't make any sense to me.
"I’ve kinda stopped caring about SR through the week as long as I stay above A class cuz I’ll always do an IMSA endurance, VRS endurance, or Global endurance series race to get them back up. It this week driving 6 hours in the 24 got me back up"
"I dunno, a lot of the people around me in work or otherwise thought winning it was pretty spectacular. They also knew about all the work it took to set the car up and get the lap times not only fast but also robotically consistent."
"Winning 9th split is only shameful if you tanked your rating in advance. If you are at your ""normal"" rating, that is still a very nice experience."
"It all just depends on the strength of the field that registers. If you had 200 people with 1k iRating, they would all just divide up between the splits without much difference. It's hard to predict what kind of SoF the top split would yield for a certain race. 

I think you are more likely to get a higher SoF on some of the multiclass races like IMSA then with the Formula Vee for instance. 

You can check which split you were in when checking out your race results. There is an option that lets you view the other splits."
"But see even if you're not the one crashing and you're the one getting crashed in to, you're in the wrong for not seeing it coming. It is a skill you develop over time."
"Yeah, I don't know. People are weird."
"If he does this for every event he can easily have a 1200 iR talent while racing with 200iR guys. 


I have seen people that only do endurance rounds having awful iRating and great pace as those races don't change your rating much anyway"
i get what youre saying but is it really winning if there are 150 people or more in the same cars splits above you?  isnt that really just the luck of how it splits then?
I have no issues avoiding turn 1 incidents but that does not mean I don't see it almost every race lol man.
"At some point, tanking just isn't beneficial. Dipping from 2k to 1k makes sense, for the fragile ego children that value an easy win over a fun, challenging race. 

Much more beyond that and you're just asking to race against unsafe rage quitters who will spend as much time spinning through the grass, throttles pinned, unsafely rejoining and sliding across the track as making a corner."
Based on that though if you haven’t got something like 8k or you might as well not even bother registering?
Splits a iRating based not luck.
"how do you get that out of what i wrote and what we were talking about? lol.  we were talkinig about people who tank so they can ""win"" and who flaunt ""winning"" the daytona 24 but are multiple splits away from the top"
"yes, that is day 1 iracing stuff.  when i isay the luck of how it split i mean where you are at in your split and what the other classes sof ends up being in relation to yours.  when i said the 150 or more people above you in class, that would mean irating"
"“Is it really winning if there are 150 or more in the same cars splits above you” based on that if I register for a race and I’m in the 3rd split of however many I may as well not bother. 

I get what you’re on about with tanking and couldn’t agree more as I don’t see the point … but what you’re saying there also means that if you’re not tanking but you’re not in the top split then it’s impossible to ‘win’"
i mean im fine if you feel that way but thats not what i wrote nor is it in the context of what we were talking about.
That’s exactly what you wrote! But yeah whatever 😂

If you still have the replay counter protest him for not holding his line or maybe int wreck if it’s bad enough. Not that you should be calling people retarded but if he’s such a stickler for the sporting code maybe he should abide by it too.

Probably not but I didn't want to use any bad words so that's what came out of my mouth.
"If you want to see it, I got the replay right here (sorry for the mic quality at the start it goes away once the replay starts). I wasn't going to send it down the chicane but I had been braking off line like that all race when coming to the busstop behind a GT3 so that I can see the braking zone better/avoid running into the back of them if they brake earlier than expected, ect.

I'm confident it was an intentional swerve to block me from a move but because he slowed down while doing it it nearly caused a crash. Included the voice clip that I think got me protested at the end for the sake of honesty.

Idk sometimes people do stupid enough things to call them one
It looks like a warning without further punishment for me.
Sounds like a warning to me without stating it’s a warning explicitly. Essentially hey here is the rule in the sporting code and try not to do what you did again or a punishment might be in place for any future protests.
"Protest upheld but just a warning.

Definitely could be more clear though."
"Yeah, this is just a warning. I once told another driver “f you” in the heat of the moment, and shortly thereafter got a very similar email- but mine had a line at the end clearly stating it was a warning."
"This is a successful protest. 

Sounds like you used abusive or vulgar language in voice chat. They’re just reminding you of the rules. 

First time is generally a reminder, subsequent times are generally a punishment of some sort. 

This is the “warning”, except iRacing doesn’t really do warnings. They do “reminders”, and then they do bans."
Tries to take you out and protests you for being justifiably angry love to see it.
You got protested for that!? Holy shit thats like a Disney movie compared to the language and insults in draftmasters…
Really strange driving there mid straight. Potentially just fell asleep at the wheel a little bit. I mean I’m sure we can all agree he wouldn’t risk his teams race randomly in the middle of a 24hr purposefully right? I typically keep my head down and get my team to direct message for clarification; keeps me from mic abuse also keeps me from blowing concentration
"Ok sweet, thank you for helping me make sense of it! I wouldn't have argued too hard if there was a punishment, I know what I said was less than ok."
"Sounds good, I wish they made it a bit more clear that it was a warning but not arguing it, I know what I did."

"Fire up a controller.

The Formula Vee, MX-5, and other cars are decent with a controller. Fire up some test drive sessions or even Time Trials and start learning some of the basics. That’s what I did and I absolutely benefitted from some time with a controller. Of course; the fun really started once I had a wheel."
Study techniques and strategies

You will learn the tracks and basic car control with a controller. I got out of rookies and won a race with a controller and I had just as much fun before I got a decent set up. You just have to make sure you practice enough to be consistent and safe on the track.

Yeah sadly closest I can find like 2-3 hours.
"I think 30psi is the minimum for the mx5.


Also rookie mazda is a fixed setup series, so you can't change it anyway."
No. Always just leave the tire pressures at minimum in iracing. It's technically a flaw in the tire model but it's also accidentally realistic because that's how most pro level tires behave. Manufacturers always have to set a minimum tire pressure for safety.
"Every time I race here I find another 1s or so.

There are many corners to optimize, so it takes a long time. (Daytona has 5 braking zones, lol)

Something ppl overlook is the camber of the road, it affects the speed you can carry a lot."
I don't think I'll ever be ready to race this track without the racing line!
"Garage 61 has a 8:27 listed as the fastest time, I think there is a more official world record time somewhere on the IR website, but I'm sure that's pretty close, and yes, it can seem impossible to imagine where people find that kind of time."
Update: Did a couple of practice laps and was able to do an 8:54. Super stoked about that.
"I found following a car in front as close as you can helps with what line they're taking.

There were a couple of places where you need to be careful but i've found it easy to stay clean."
It's a tribute to moto2 rider Luis Salom who sadly passed away at that corner in a practice crash in 2016

According to https://whenrace.com/srf you can find an SRF discord at https://discord.gg/m8MKZA7bhK
check the vRunoffs group by Steve Ray through Facebook and iRacing forums. Very competitive large fields
"It used to be pretty big but I guess got eclipsed by newer cars. Bummer as it’s fun in the game.

"Thanks, but it seems to have virtually no up to date content or activity."
Over on Garage 61 we have telemetry for a lap that's 4 seconds faster: [https://garage61.net/app/tracks/281](https://garage61.net/app/tracks/281)
"With 170 laps to go, get really racey and try to pass the single line of cars on the outside. When nobody goes with you aggressively side draft everyone until you netcode into somebody and wreck half the field."
"Run the bottom and don't push until after the last pit stop.  If you are out front of a group of cars then you will have to pit before everyone else, so watch out for that.  Practice your pit entry and entire pit process.  Any F up on pit road is going to hurt you pretty bad unless you can catch a caution.  No reason to do anything aggressive until the end."
Luck
"For the bulk of the race, stay low and tight with your drafting partner(s). May just be me, but high line is way too stressful for my weak heart. 

Practice brake dragging over lifting. It will let you control your speed much more accurately and keep a tighter draft on the car ahead and cause less check up action.

Be patient. 500 miles is a long distance. Cede positions instead of fighting, take easy gains when presented. When you go to take one and someone wants to get racey, let them have it and make a mental note to watch them so if and when they trigger a wreck, you aren't victimized.

Practice. Practice long runs. Figure out your tire wear so you can maximize it in the race. Practice pit stops. Entry especially."
"I ran my first Daytona 500 last year and it was amazing. Especially knowing you have a full 500 miles and several pits stop, you have to pace yourself through the race. Depending on where you start, you want to make sure you protect your car and get in the draft.

Fuel saving is huge in the first first fuel run, as everyone wants to get to the 40 lap mark to pit. Also the track changes through the race, as there was no grip with these Next Gen Cars in the first 100 miles. For the first two fuel runs we were all single file on the high line, as we were getting loose getting into the corners and off the corners.

The first 60-90 laps usually go green with back to back green flags stops.
It’s very important to communicate on the radio to work with other drivers to come in and off of pit road together, also to work together if you fall out of the main pack.

Now with the characteristics of this car: With these Next Gen Cars, side drafting is huge so sometimes it’s better to push a car than just being on its side and slowing you both down. When you’re out of the draft, you lose 10-15 mph instantly. These cars cause a lot of drag and in draft master last week or so, the bottom line can no move at all, almost like it was hitting a brick wall. I don’t know if anyone else noticed this, but the Gen 4 where more fun to drive than these cars.
But the next Gen has a quick closing rate when drafting so be aware to lift and always looking behind you to see how much space you have from the car behind, as chain reactions are easy to happen in the pack.

For my personal strategy, I believe at Daytona, you need the track position, especially for the second half of the race. It’s hard to pass towards the end of the race than in the beginning ,so I tend to be in the top 10 early and try to save fuel as much as possible, with the goal of pitting every 40 laps. 

Taking four tires when you need to take a full tank early in race and in the second half, when I need to come in, taking two rights sides is the best as the track now have grip unlike at the start. With these cars you can push, but you have to be smart and watch the water temperature."
"During the 50 lap Gen 4 Series, I'll hang back & try to keep the draft with the first pack, but it's not important because I'm expecting a yellow early on where the field will bunch back up. I like staying to the back of any pack that I'm running, so I can have a bigger picture of any accidents developing. 


 I try to stay in the top 15 and then I'll start to push up to the front with 10-15 to go, depending on how much lap traffic is mixed in with the leaders. I'll usually start on the inside line, then get big runs to the outside because the inside line is usually stacked up pretty thick, all moving at about the same speed bumper to bumper. Usually there are less drivers jumping to the outside line in fear they'll get hung out to dry and lose some of the draft. That's why you can get huge runs at times. 


Last resort, if the inside & outside lines are stacked, I'll get a run and go up the middle to make it 3 wide, but only with less than 3 to go and only if there's an opening. White flag, if I'm top 5 & I'm P4 on the outside line, I'll push P2 down the straightaway, then lift off a bit, get back into the draft and try to get a run to the outside of P2. Also there's a good chance that P1 & P2 get into each other through the tri-oval as I'm making a run on the outside. I've won a couple of times at Talladega this week getting a run on the outside. I've also gotten caught up in a few wrecks near the finish line or just couldn't get runs to get me to the top 5. Sometimes a top 10 is fine or having zero incidents and a top 20."
"u/dj_yeej has a [video](https://youtu.be/LHJXP98PSE8?si=ygQLZ8z3H8a2_D5_) with solid Daytona tips, I would give that a watch. 

As for me, I generally run the bottom at Superspeedways because at the end of the day you have less room to escape if you’re up top or in the middle. I’m not particularly great at pit strategy and these are the one kind of races where not using voice chat may hurt me but you can usually catch on when a group is pitting if you pay attention and run behind a few cars in your draft pack."
This will be my first and I really enjoy running Suoerspeedways. Are these usually a caution fest or not? It seems that it might be early on and then it likely goes green?
Where is the 'hang back and wait for cautions' option?
Get damage in lap 4 and then end the race with a damaged car 20 turns down in 11th position due to all the others who wreck out.
"get up front, stay up front, get shuffled back, practice getting to front again. Find friends along the way"
"So Im new and havent found a solid answer from googling, does the 500 use the next gen or the normal NASCAR Cup cars? On the schedule it only says NASCAR Cup but a lot of posts have been made from previous years talking about the next gen car, so I assume it’s that one. 

Id like to try out the race this year but I’d need to buy a car regardless of what type it uses"
As is tradition
Don’t forget to blame everyone else!
solid advice
ok thanks

Is there still room for this?  I know a couple teams that want to sign up.
Absolutely!  Signups are still open!
"I won't lie. The gt3s in my split were horrible. Like blocking and turning in on lmdhs all 24 hours. Last year, we were blessed with awesome gt3s and I was missing them I'm glad your split was respectful."
"We came P2  in LMP2 in one of the lower splits for it I'd imagine. All the madness seemed to come from the LMP2s (not overly surprising given the relative SoF). 

The GTPs and GT3s were largely very good. We survived a few hairy moments but nothing too crazy. Was genuinely quite a relaxing race at times tbh. Wish there had been more GT3s to keep it more interesting."
The GT3s in my mid-level split was very good and courteous for the most part. More so than the GTPs and at most I had a 0x with them. Very pleasant to work with overall.
Mfw bottom split so all i had to deal with were other GT cars
"I usually drive the GTPs / LMP3s, try to be respectful, but I've seen so many murders by fellow faster class drivers and I was expecting bad things. 

It probably helped as I knew when the faster class were going to be making moves, but we had very few issues, probably only a few stupid dives into the bus stop or turn 6 after the kink. 

All our issues were caused by other GT3 drivers doing stupid stuff... Including someone 17 laps down fighting the car in front of us into T1 and causing a pile up."
Your problem with GTP's is your own.
"Just saying... if you have been working at a win for 4 years, you're probably perpetually underrated. Not saying you're tanking, but properly rated teams generally don't have much shot at winning special events. 


We've been running most of them since they started, and we've never once had the pace of the top few teams in our split. There's always at least 2-5 teams that are either smurfs, or have drivers who haven't raced enough to reach an accurate rating, or who are fast but crash enough in regular official series that their rating is suppressed.


We, with our ratings being from consistency and wreck avoidance, don't stand a chance on pace, and at least one of the faster teams always survives.


Sorry, off-topic rant. Just frustrating to put in many hours for special events, but know our ceiling is like P3-P5 even if we run a perfect race."
"my team was in split 24 of 45 for the Saturday 12:00 GMT timeslot. I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and respectful ALL of the drivers in the split were. GTP drivers were patient and never divebombed us GT3s. From what I saw, most of the GT3's were respectful of GTP battles. My team started from the last row of the grid and finished with a P3 at the end of the race. This will for sure be an event that stays engrained in my mind forever. Had such a blast for this years Daytona 24!"
My team was in LMP2 1600 SOF. It was pretty good except for 1 GTP driver that hit us in the kink when we had to slow for a GT3 car. And then proceded to insult our driving skills over chat. Lets just say they took others 3 wide in the same kink and failed to finish. And a GT3 car who spun in a crowd and decided not to hold their brake.
"As a GTP driver, I was very pleased with the respect between classes in our split. Seemed like there was an unspoken agreement that GTPs would refrain from really late moves on GTs into the Bus Stop, and in return, GTs would leave space on the outside of the kink to facilitate easy passes into T5. I don't think we made contact with any GT cars all race, save for a couple of very minor 0x taps in T3 or T5, which was all good."
"We won split 4 16.00gmt start, we had some nasty gtp drivers in out split. But the holy grail went to plus motorsports!! They ended the race with 307 incidents!!! 3 of the 4 drivers could not string a lap together and one of them was slower through the bus stop than the gt3s!!!!! We had to avoid so much carnage from the divebombs it was horrendous!"
"For a relatively low IR (1.6k approx) our split was relatively clean with only one or two very bad GT3s.

Some didn't know to just stick to their lines but at least usually made their moves early-ish enough.

We had no major contact with them just a few scare that I handled with moves that were probably a bit too ballsy."
"We (a GTP) had a pretty respectful split ourselves. The GT3s were slightly problematic, but nothing worth complaining about.

Only incident I personally had in the car was rear-ended another GTP in the bus stop 😅

He checked up for a GT3, I thought we had room to make it through full speed. By the time his brake lights came on, it was too late. I apologized profusely"
Same our gt3’s seemed like they were all intoxicated
"I think we've kind of hit that point where the reputation of GTP and LMPs has gotten so bad people just expect the worst from them and behave like they expect them to be asses. Obviously, it's not true, but it's hard to break that reputation, especially when it gets ""proven"" so constantly."
"I was in split 5 in the 4th time slot. GTP sof was around 2.5-2.7k i believe and gt3 was closer to 3k, however we at the bottom split lmp2s, mostly sub 1k. It was a nightmare at times haha"
"I was a gt3 in split 16 of the main start. 3,5K in both gt3 and gtp, but 1k on lmp2s. We went from 11th to 2nd because 4 best teams got killed by lmp2s and rest of the positions we got on pace and by not damaging the car.

On my stints I spent more time dodging and defending from lmp2s than focusing on getting good laps."
"I always do at least one practice session in the week before any big endurance event in the fastest class car, just so I can get a feel for what they experience, and what they need by way of cooperation."
be quiet.
"Yeah, that's pretty much how it was for us.

I posted this thread because it was such a contrast to last year, which was just lights to flag homicidal lunacy from the prototypes. I think only two Gt3s escaped without some level of damage, multiple laps down.

It sucked to lose P1 because of damage, but that was a genuine mistake by a GTP, and we were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Shit happens. But we still really enjoyed the race."
"We dodged that bullet, our split was the first with no LMP2s, meaning the one above us had the triple digits.

For the Roar the weekend before my split had 2.7 LMP3, 2.4 GT4 (which I was driving) and 711 TCR. It was like driving through a minefield."
iRacing really need to fix this for big events. Find some way of binning the splits so there isn't that huge disparity.
"I think the faster class would be prudent to do the reverse as well. Not Daytona, but the kink at road America is a great example of a corner that is very simple in a prototype but awkward if being lapped in a gt3."
"I agree. Filling the splits from top to bottom is stupid. They should put those 700ir lmp2 drivers with other classes of 700ir drivers. But oh well, at least thanks to them we got to celebrate after quite an unfortunate start (internet disconnect on 3rd stint). 

My average from the whole race was 1.45\~ and there were LMP2s who drove just a few seconds quicker."

That's about what I thought... Thanks.
"Henry is reallly fast, I’ve raced in his splits before."
It comes with practice.  Slowing for wrecks is good advice as it gives you more time to react. 
"Always pays to slow down so you can try to get a better sense for where the other car is going to end up, plus the slower the crash you may be less likely to sustain critical damage (among other reasons)."
"Give more space in low splits


If you’re hitting people spinning. You’re probably not slowing down enough


Also, if you crash. Reset to the pits and repair. Don’t try to drive unless it’s a minor hit."
"Always slow for yellow flags. It's kinda the rule.

People who dont hold brakes and roll across the track have a special place in hell.

Ideally you want to aim for the ""back"" of the car. What i mean by the ""back"" is not every situation the car is facing the right way, so you aim for the rear of the direction in which they are travelling from. 

So sometimes you might be aiming for the nose of the car if they are rolling backwards from left to right, sometimes it might be aiming for the tail of the car if they are rolling forwards from right to left and then whatever other random combo arises."
I feel like there needs to be greater emphasis on holding brakes after an accident. Would stop quite a bit of the unnecessary collateral damage I'd presume.
"Yes, slow down and usually the car will spin to the outside in fast corners and to the inside in slow corners. You can't always avoid it but you are doing something very wrong if you are getting 16x in back to back races."
"Awareness and reaction time, instinct in being able to estimate where and how an out of control car is going to slide. Mostly comes with experience, overthinking it won't do you any good so don't sweat it too much :)"
"If you are close behind a car trying to overtake, when you realize that you are not going to and you are entering a curve that can cause spins or you know that is a difficult one, just lift a little and leave some space before braking point. You will have more opportunities to overtake later and you will have more time to avoid a spinning car.

Also you should be a lot more careful in the first two laps, specially the first because of cold tyres"
"Bonus points: try to identify bad drivers early (weird lines, painfully obvious mistakes, etc) and watch out for them in spin zones. I like to open a small gap so I have room to manuever when they inevitably spin.

Also, when trying to dodge a crash, better go for 1x off track than try to make a close pass and likely get dinged with 4x anyway."
"i usually get downvoted for saying it but just knowing where brake pedal is and knowing when to use it can get you \~2k without a ridiculous amount of effort.  at least in road.  

think about it this way.  if you saw some cars spinning on the highway or crashing in front of you what are you gonna do, just hold down the throttle cause they are supposed to know how to handle a spinning car, to hold the brakes coming to a stop, yield and generally not be an asshole or do you proactively try not to die or wreck your car by slowing down at least some till you know you can make it?"
"You will learn to start seeing the slide happen earlier and earlier the more you race, and also to predict which direction the car will end up, so you can avoid it, there's no magic always correct decision unfortunately.  You will also learn to watch a drivers approach to turns and learn who you need to give that extra gap too because it's only a matter of time before they make a mistake."
"Give more space in corners where people are more prone to spin. If you see a spinner lift off and assess. Check mirrors to make sure you aren’t going to get rear ended or turn into a worse situation. Go around wreck and take the 1x if needed.

Practice. Patience. Awareness."
"Just slow down. People will pass you, most will get collected up in the wreck. 

Then you can drive away with a giggle and a smirk"
"Check up to give yourself time and space to avoid the spinning driver. Even just lifting a little can help massively.


Sometimes you just get a whole lot of bad luck. It's good to analyze what you could have done differently but sometimes you just need to let it go and hop in the next race."
"Aim for the smoke and floor it.

 /s"
You have to predict where the car is going to end up. It may be dumb at first but I think seeing a lot of crash compilations for fun purposes gave me some understanding about how cars are behaving in a crash. That helped me a lot. Mix it with slowing down a bit and I think it will be good
"It's a developed skill. Most of crash avoidance is seeing from as far away and possible and reacting to it as quick as possible. I remember when I had this problem going into a wreck when looking back at the replay I should've seen the smoke or a car spinning. Then one day I got ""good"" at spotting the visual cues. Now my main problem is getting rear ended, side swiped, or coming around corners without enough time to see anything."
It would be a big help if the person that spins holds their break and does not just slam the gas and run into on coming cars.
"Watch the replays, and be honest with yourself: what could you have done differently to avoid that crash? What clues did the car ahead give you that should have told you they were about to lose it?"
"I’m gonna play devils advocate here cause I’m one of the few drivers that slow for yellow flags (it still comes naturally to me after 30+!years of rl racing) but 90% of the time in sims you’re  better off holding it flat if there is a car behind you because it’s unlikely that they’ll slow down. Also, the person who spins is not likely to hold their brakes so the soon you get past the better.

Before someone chirps in with ‘report them to the stewards” 

Been there done that and the stewards do not care about someone causing an incident by speeding through a yellow flag. They don’t see it as intentional. I have been told so much via email. Contrary to their own rules which state it is a DQ offence, it is not something high on their agenda.

As you can tell I’m pretty jaded and exhausted over this issue cause it’s a huge bug bear of mine 

TL;DR Yes you should slow for yellow flags or incidents it’s the right thing to do but be aware the person behind you probably won’t."
"Yeah, doubly true. Slow is the way to go… at least for this situation"
"Yeah makes sense. I tried to speed around them, but they rolled into my path. I was too frustrated to watch the replay but I swear a guy turned as he was rolling back which made it hard to judge. Not slowing down was my big mistake"
"I remember a lesson from my youth - ""Start to spin both feet in"". Meaning one foot on the clutch and one foot on the brake."
"16x from both races. Not each race, lol. Two spins in front in the first race and another spin in the next… multiple cars were involved in that one so I picked up another 4x on my way out. I had a safety rating of 3.5 and now it’s wayyyy down

I appreciate the advice. I’ll definitely keep an eye out for that"
Stop brandishing that dangerous logic. That's how people get hurt.
"Also if you are not slowing down, you have very little grip to maneuver. Slowing down let's you make quite drastic changes in direction without spinning out yourself."
Did they increase the 192-bit memory bus in the newer version? It can run VR but that is a well-known bottleneck they added when the 4070Ti was first released and then quickly pulled back.
"It's not so simple. 4000 series has lower bit memory bus but much larger cache, so you get more performance with 192-bit than last gen 256+ bits. You can see this being true based on many 4K benchmarks."
"Yes, it’s on AD103 just like the 4080. Same 256bit VRAM bus, but less CUDA cores, less TMUs, and less ROPs than the 4080 (still more of each of those than the 4070ti though).

Important thing is, listed at $799 msrp, same price as the ti msrp."
The question OP asked was specific to VR performance. I can tell you as someone with a 4070Ti that the bus is 100% a bottleneck in VR. Any two second search will surface plenty of owners with the same criticism. No reason to pull 4K benchmarks when we can measure the VR performance directly.
I am not with the tech.  So this is important in the sense the ti super has something over the 4070 super?
"Oh shit, I was comparing the ti to the ti super.

Basically, I think the ti super is replacing the ti at $799 msrp but gets you much closer to a 4080.

The super will replace the 4070 at $599, but bump you closer to the old ti specs for less money.

Generally speaking, the super will be great on monitors, but go with the ti super if thinking about vr."
"Calling it the 4070 Ti Super was dumb. They should have called it more along the lines of the 4075, because it's damn near a 4080."
"This last part.  The DLSS on the 4070 super is enough for screens, but I think the extra vram on the ti super and 4080 super will benefit VR."
"Engineers really need to chill with the aerodynamics, that guy displaced so much air it bent your bumper"

"I'm curious what percentage of deaths were caused my LMP/prototype, seems like a lot"
"Oh hey hello! I remember you, we finished on the same lap! "
Jaws of life needed for that one.
It slices!it dices! The new barrier wall!
Looks exactly like how Basic Ollie got killed too.
Is this not fixable?
must've been the wind
"That's really unfortunate dude. You both did everything right, you gave the LMP the inside after the kink and they waited rather than diving you, but sometimes it's just not your day."
You drove the Audi for the 24H? That's mighty brave of you.
You have obviously edited this video to make iRacing look bad.  iRacing has perfect physics and would never have dodgy collision detection like that.
"Reminds me of bf3, when they basically invented the term netcode 💀"
"Grosjean, is that you?"
![gif](giphy|TFIrZ24YGFxmFfgOEE)

Too much rear wind!
Wrect him? Durn near killed him!!

Oooof
Holy shit bro. That’s cold xD

"Crashes happen when cars try to pass each other. Since GTPs and LMP2s pass GT3s all the time, that's naturally when most incidents will occur.

And spins all by yourself won't *usually* break your car in any significant way."
"It's probably 50/50.  GT3s aren't always faultless.  They are indecisive sometimes or take a weirdly defensive line/hog the middle of the track making it unclear where they want you to go.

Sure GTPs sometimes take some senseless dives, but Daytona is also a track where both cars have a good ""out"" in most of the dangerous parts.  Sure it may cost a 1x, but a 1x is a lot cheaper than a 4x + 15 mins of repairs."
"I had two contacts with prototypes.  
1st was a GTP just rear ending me because they completely misjudged their space.  
2nd I think was 50/50 my fault and the GTP. I lost the rear end and tapped the inside wall at turn 1. GTP ran into the back of me a second or two later. Had they slowed, it could have been avoided, but also, it was my fault for tapping the wall in the first place."
"We were in a GT3, our repairs were all caused by other GT3s doing stupid things (one just stopped in T1), another started fighting with a GTP who was doing nothing wrong."
With my team we had 30 minutes (6 me and 25 another guy) of required because the same gtp wanted to go 3 wide on the oval and he forgot that the gt3 have to brake earlier compared to the GTP
Was you in the yellow porsche with the kangaroo on top?
"Not really. Core issue is speed of light and how fast you can move information around the world. You're not going to solve for that any time soon. So you're left with how to deal with the fact you're going to have wonky data sometimes. You can do what AC does and teleport all over the god damn map, or you can do what iRacing does and try to smooth it out. Neither is ideal but... incomplete information is incomplete."
"Probably is but if your top5 in class fighting for position, this repair and a tow effectively ruins your race"
"Yeah it is, by people accepting that netcode exists and they’re racing online, so they leave an extra couple of feet of space."
"Not only did we do the 24 in the audi, we had are set up advice from one of the winners in top split, which made the rear end so loose."
"Netcode has been a thing since AOE - I remember using it during that time period. If I was using it frequently then, I am going to guess it spans before that as well."
oh yeah my favorite thing was driving through fences and being stationary for half a second until the game decided it was enough waiting and let me trough. metro was really bad too
You don’t realise the times where another car drove through your rear quarter and got away with it.
"Too soon?


He survived though!"

And this is why we need indicators in iRacing. So that a GT3 can show what hes gonna do
"If everyone had 50ms ping which never happens. At 100mph the 2 way trip time means both players have a 15ft fudge zone where anything can happen with net code. At 150mph that goes up to 22ft. If the player ping is 75ms which can happen with out of region servers pretty often. Now we are over 30ft.

&#x200B;

You are totally right and people write this issue off soooo often...Sprinkle in the occasional dropped packet lol."
"speed of light ain't the issue. if everybody on iracing had fiber cable internet, the issues would be extremely rare. the problem is that people all around the world connect to the internet via much less efficient and reliable connections like copper cables and even mobile wireless."
"It might actually with netcode implementing rollbacks like in fighting games. It mitigates a lot of ping issue while allowing for quick reaction.

It may not be easy to implement for 40+ clients in the same session though."
"The netcode impact with the other car is one thing, but any time a car gets embedded in a barrier I will file that as a bug."
I meant net code
"Audi is fantastic imo for the sprint races, hell even the 2ish hour endurance series. For a 12H or 24H race, I'd either be using a suuuuper safe setup or I'd just go with the BMW/Merc/Ferrari."
"I mean probably, but battlefields netcode was so bad I remember that’s where I first heard it. An old BF youtuber I watched made the joke about the game inventing the phrase netcode and I’ve loved that joke ever since lmao

Guess it bombed here 💀😂"
"Or does the indicator mean that's where they want the GTP/P2 to overtake?

Posturing the car is a lot more effective. Be very clear by leaving no gap to the side of the track you want. 

Don't float in the middle of the road. "
"Judging by ACC; this might even be detrimental, because some people for some fucking reason decide to use the indicator to mean ""please pass me on this side"". So they will indicate left, I am gearing myself up to pass them on the right, only for them to go to the right."
I see. New possibilities would cause new problems. :-/
"I'm on fibre, but I'm on the other side of the world. You cannot beat the physics of it, so I had 300 ping the whole race"
"Checking in from Thailand where I have 1,000 down 1,000 up fiber internet and iracing just displays a big fat 300 ping for me permanently."
Only so much you can do
"With net code, we win ALOT. The system is usually very good. But the bad ones stand out."
"Netcode can only do so much. It's essentially trying to ""guess"" where the two cars are when it doesn't have the data in real-time to actually know where they exactly are. I'd be interested to know where OP is located and where the other driver is located because generally the worse your ping is (being further away from the server), the worse the netcode ends up being."
Yeah the netcode was notoriously bad on launch.
"In my experience even that is not enought sometimes.  
I had prototypes in the past which wanted to use THEIR PLANNED LINE!.  
Even if I was glued to this side since 2 corners :D"
"In the real world track events I do, this is normal in events where a ""point by"" is needed for passing. Most organizations require a clear ""point by"" in HPDE sessions - out the window to the left to say ""pass me on the left"" or over the roof to the right for ""pass me on the right."" Some allow use of turn signals instead, especially for cars in which it is impractical to do point bys (arm restraints, closed cockpit with windows that don't open and the like). In all of these I've been in, the turn signal indicates the side on which you should pass, not the direction the signalling car intends to move like on the street."
"okay I was a bit too optimistic. but still, if you go into a battle with someone without fibre, it may be noticeably worse."
that sucks. are you sure you're connected to the Asian servers?
"Exceptions to every rule for sure :D.   In the split I was in for the D24 (admittedly with higher iR GT cars while we were in GTP), the GT cars were very good most of the time at communicating what they were doing and what made sense for both parties to negotiate.

Lower iR GT cars (and lower iR prototypes too, like our split was roughly 2k average I think?) won't have the same presence of mind."
"also, 300ms might be due to server ineficciencies. I have easily sub 200 ping to American servers from Europe."
The league I race with is European and all of my friends are American so we race team races on NA servers probably. I have tried to get some asian friends into iRacing but they just can't afford the buy in. It would be two months salary just to buy a G29 :(
"Yeah I'm a bit further away, in Australia"
"Most of the servers are in Boston. From Berlin to Boston it's 6000km, from [Perth](https://wondernetwork.com/pings/Perth) to Boston it's 18000km. Literally three times the distance, so the 250ms ping I see reflected on that website would be *very good* considering the distance, at 72% the speed of light."
That’s pretty much as far as it gets.
wait they don't run fiber cables through the Pacific?
"[They do](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/), but that percentage is just compared to the theoretical limit. Since the speed of light in fiber optics are already 60%-70% of the speed of light in a vacuum, I assume those numbers are based on 100% being a perfect point-to-point fiber optic connection with no processing latency on either end. So any reduction in that number would come from either non-linear cable routing (needing to go from Boston to San Francisco to Hawaii to Sydney to Perth), or from retransmission through the various routers in between."
Just so you are aware iracing still do the 24 hour of le man every year its just not a special event. They add it to the global endurance series and for season 3 they make all the races 24 hours instead of 6.
Yeah we have ran it the past few years. We’re just trying to do an event to raise money for the guy and we chose Le Mans since there’s no special event for it
"Was in GT3 around 2k irating. It was pretty bad, a lot of people who clearly haven't practiced the track. I'm no master of the ring, but people are braking in kinks that are flat, and taking 30% of turns in 2nd gear. Makes close racing difficult. 

But driving a Porsche on the ring always makes me feel like Kevin Estre, so I'll go back in tomorrow."
"My split was fine. I don't like racing GTP here, its too fast for me really. So I did my one race for participation. The field was fast and mostly mistake free. It was 2nd split (1.9k)."
I drove the 'P2 and never caught GT3 pack. Only the back end of LMDH that caught me after my pitstop
It looked fine watching from a twitch stream. As far as I can remember there was not much multiclass class traffic unless someone gets way out of position until the very last lap.
Just hotlapping after 2-3 laps
"I have no actual knowledge whatsoever about how it went but I'll still tell you:

T1 was a shitshow. 

Couple of cars went off at Flugplatz and took several others with them. 

Couple of more cars went off at Schwedenkreuz but with the new grass they just went into the catch fence instead of taking out more cars when they slid across Aremberg. 

Car went off at Wherseifen and slid all the way down the hill. 

2 wide at Bravery. Both died. 

Pass right before Galgenkopf instead of just waiting for the long straight. Then repassed. This happened on the next few laps too.

On the last lap 3 wide going into Tiergarten. All died."
Im tempted to try. maybe the gtps only lap 1 time or so. not sure.
IMSA is at Nurburing this week. Not Nordschleife
"I did 2 races in LMP2 and it's hard as hell but in both my splits people showed patience and good racecraft skills, GT3 it was more dramatic but nothing to report in my end. looking forward to race the GTP, I fear there is a little more aggressive or should I say crazy driving in the GTP."
"how does the grid get set? i noticed its just practice and race, no quali"
"I did the race once so far and I only caught gt3s that spun, not the leaders"
It's at the Nordschleife.

There are separate qualifying sessions. The race session is an 8 min warmup and then the race.
Then why comment? I don’t really understand it when people feel the need to try to correct someone and they themselves don’t even have the basic information in the first place.
"gotcha, thanks"

"The take away is not to not help, it's to not help if you don't have the information.

Would've taken you what, a minute tops to open up the UI and verify?"
"Blurry textures are usually because of RAM shortage I think. This is more seen by the newer tracks as they are more graphically intense and (sometimes, I don't have Slinger) less optimized. 

So, older tracks can be fine while you can have issues on newer tracks, which can be solved by lowering the settings. If the graphics are fine on other new(!) tracks, I would advice deleting the track from your iRacing folder and to re-install it."
Thank you! I will try that! Appreciate your help

"There may be a track on your schedule that only allows 17 cars, which is limiting how many you can use everywhere.

My initial guess is that you accidentally selected a Legends Oval configuration. Possibly Legacy Texas or Legacy Charlotte."
You're right. I took Legacy Texas not realizing it was only the Legends Oval. Thank you :)
"Glorious!

&#x200B;

Yesterday I was leading at Charlotte and my iracing application crashed on the white flag lap. I am looking forward to this track"
Solid editing.
That corner on the first lap is made for that kind of thing.
Going to that turn on Rudskogen on the first lap without being cautious is a recipe for disaster. Good on you!
"Big brain move, I love it"
"Mental victory?  You got lucky and avoided trouble.  Clean and aware racing is really important, but I don’t think you pulled some sort of “plan” off."

I got a whooping .45 SR and 11 iR just from that."

Your plan is the same as 9/10 racers. Your “plan” can be drive slow and hope everyone else crashes but that’s not going to work in pretty much any race past Rookie or even higher level Rookie splits.

Good thing i read the comments before using anything more than the free version
HARD pass
"Thing is, every time I've seen comments about racelab double charging, it's because of user error (someone registered with 2 accounts) and they guy actually proved it a few times (check his comment history).

I’ve literally never had an issue with racelabs.  I pay for premium and I’ve used it for over 3 years now.
What’s abusive about them? I see the hate comments but don’t know what the context is.
"This isn’t hate, this is how capitalism works."

And in regards of the guy that runs it being a chode… most of my sales guys that work for me are also chodes.   So who really gives a shit?!

I’ve tried a couple other options before I found racelabs and even though they are free, doesn’t stand up to the customization that is available with racelabs.   Takes care of my fuel also.  I don’t have to rely on the built in iRacing one auto fuel which I tried and didn’t like."
"Personally I think unless you're a streamer, don't use anything. [iOverlay.app](https://iOverlay.app) if you need something."
"Sorry to hear you would take a couple of posts on Reddit to turn you away, racelabs are fully aware of the payment issues from last year and don’t hide from it.  If you wanted to learn or discuss it in full without the trolls please give me a shout.  "
"My question was directed at the other guy who complained about them. Thanks for replying with your experience. I've read Race Lab had some billing issues last year but refunded everyone supposedly. I currently don't use any 3rd party overlays. 


Hell, I just started using Trading Paints this week, which is a great free app. Since I use the free Paint Net paint program that's compatible with Trading Paints, I'm only using the free version, but I'll donate something to them for their work. I'm still on the fence about purchasing any overlay s/w."
"I like having a RADAR overlay and do find the overlays a bit more useful than iRacing’s built in ones; mostly because I can put them on other displays and things like that. 

I’ll check out iOverlay!"
"Why not discuss it publicly?

Can you refute the public doxing accusation? Because that’s the one that concerns me. I don’t want to do business with folks that don’t have solid information security and privacy protocols. It’s nothing personal.

And it really is that simple. If you doxxed a customer, even accidentally, then I’m not going to do business with you. Again, it’s not personal. It’s just a bad idea in this day and age to share information with companies who don’t take that really seriously. Privacy and data protection should be like a religious devotion to people in the digital marketplace. Such an accusation should make your blood boil instead of just seemingly glossing over it and focusing on the innocuous payment issues. It’s concerning, to say the least."
"Also; it did make me dig into things a bit more. When I learned what the “payment issues” were I was mortified. 

Did you end up refunding all of those customers or did you still insist on retroactively charging them for several months worth of service at once?

Thankfully I use virtual cards for everything and can set individual limits so you wouldn’t be able to do such a thing with my account anyway, it’d just be denied."
"The only payments charged were to people who didn’t understand how to cancel their subs, some had even deleted the app but had an active sub.  Once racelabs accounting system picked up the missed charges it automatically caught up with what they were owed and took the money, they then refunded it all as felt it was the right thing to do as it was their billing issue that caused it and customer service comes over profit, unfortunately some still go online to bad mouth "
Oh ok.   Funny enough I also pay for trading paints pro.
Have you tried crewchief? Jim’s my right hand man and that’s about it haha
"I would happily discuss it publicly, sorry did I say otherwise.  Again though words are not correct, doxing is actively searching for and publishing private or identifying info.  - it wasn’t done on purpose and all in the best of the moment 

Yes, one users email address was reported to have been posted amongst all the conversations regarding the subscription charge issue within racelabs discord server for a very short period and removed.

From everything I have seen Istvan and racelabs have nothing to hide.

Sorry I’m just a user that helps people in their discord who got a moderator and support role as I try and see sense whilst helping fellow users"
"You say me, sorry I’m not racelabs as per my other reply to you.

From my understanding, No user came forward saying that they hadn’t been charged but were quick to moan when the system charged in one lump sum for their used subscriptions.

Any user subscribed had the charges reverted, even users who had accidentally signed up with multiple accounts and entered their details more than once.

They have nothing to hide."
Oh yeah I use it; I just find the radar overlay to also be helpful.
"I appreciate what you’re trying to do but honestly that’s enough for me. 

“Accidentally” posting an email address shows that the company has a lack of controls, policies, internal QC and internal systems of accountability. Having worked in the information security field; it’s the sort of thing that’s a massive red flag. Because if that kind of information can leak out; then who knows what else can leak out and where. It’s indicative of a system and company-wide failure to take information security and user privacy seriously."
"You say you work in the information security then you would understand an email account submitted to the racelabs team being posted in a discord server would cause no material loss.

Again, sorry you feel so strongly about it. I love the app myself and fortunately for me my payments always went out so I hadn’t had a subscription for free."
"No; you’re missing the forest for the trees here. 

A company with strong information security controls would *never* post a customer email address to a discord and if they did; any and all related employees would be swiftly terminated. It’s one of those things that would simply never ever happen. When it DOES happen, it’s evidence of a serious issue. 

It’s not about the email address, it’s about how the email address shows a lack of attentiveness to information security and user privacy. When you couple that with being unaware that users weren’t being charged it just seems like the company as a whole has no idea what’s going on. Broad systemic incompetency. Happens a lot with small startups. They get big but they don’t hire the right people; and founders are reluctant to relinquish control and admit the company has outgrown their skillset and abilities and bring people in who can do the things they can’t. 

Security is all about the weakest link. When you share personal details with a company, those details could be accessed and later used to access much more important things about you. That’s why *every* company needs to take it seriously. And clearly RaceLabs doesn’t."
"Wow I’m pretty sure this team was in my split. Everyone was complaining about them being so much faster than every other team. I went and checked my results, and yep we moved up a spot and the first guys race history matches your screen shots!"
Oh I get it. Lose in other races to drop your irating to put you into a lower split and increase your chances of a win = tanking. Dont mind me. Just trying to help out out the other window lickers out here.
"Forgot to add this picture

"Nice work if you lodged the protest, these guys have no business ruining it for others."
"I said in one of the earlier threads about DQ's that being DQ'd from a race isn't really a punishment if you get to keep the iR. But getting DQ'd from a special event, especially a 24 hour race you win, IS a big deal. 

Glad to see this happen."
You've shown a pic of 3 results all with ir gains. How are they tanking? Or am I missing something?
Wait iracing finally did something against this?
I will never understand why people would intentionally tank to win. What satisfaction do you get from that? They're the type of people who lean on a supercar parked in the street and post it on social media seriously acting like it's theirs. Pathetic...
"Great news, good job for reporting them "
We're you also the bottom split on Friday? Me and my buddies were in that and we all protested too. Glad to see iracing take action
"Fucking 0.4K dumbass on that team decided to let us all know at the end of the race that he owns a setup shop and that’s why they won, because they had the superior setup, what 0.4K driver owns a setup shop?"
I feel like it’s fairly common. They can then post on socials how they won the 24 but not mention they were 6k aliens who raced in the 78th split with a bunch of bums.
I raced with there was someone in my race the other day like this clearly tanking. Is there a way to report it?
"We were in second from bottom split in the first time slot and also had the winner DQ'd. Our team was also DQ'd for having a team member no show but the tanking team got sent to last last place whereas we got to stay at the top DQ'd team.

So iRacing definitely rates tanking DQs as worse than drive time DQs."
"Just in case they read this, you're pathetic."
"Now if only they'd do the same with smurfs.

It's not that hard. Special event = must use main account. Smurf accounts in special events are every bit as detrimental to the user experience as tanking."
They should have their accounts banned for the next Daytona 24hr race as well!
If I ever win I am going to get DQ'd for tanking too. My irating score has been lowered every single race this week
"I'd like to see the same level of criticism against drivers who smurf but no, that's acceptable when in reality it's the same concept. 

Both are shitty drivers and you can't convince me otherwise."
Can someone explai?
"How can you prove tanking though? My irating goes all over the place. Sometimes there’s those bad races, and also real life shit happens.

Edit : literally ask a question and downvotes, y’all are hilarious"
I'm at the newbie stage where I'm switching between open wheelers and gt cars (switching around screws up my lap times by like 0.5-1.0sec for 5-10ish laps) and you could say I'm tanking.... when I go on f4....
Too bad I tank even when I am trying to win!
Protip: get a few 1x or even self crash and then retire. Much harder to prove tanking in those situations. Ppl dumb
Do the actual winners get a chance to download a winners certificate? Not sure if you even get one for special event races
do we protest when we see people are tanking? I think U notice some people intentionally dropping IR in some of my splits by just registering and never racing
There were more than just that team but I wasn't taking the time to protest them all
"Was this the second to bottom split? If so, I was in it and hear the commotion the last 10 minutes of the race and got moved up 2 spots in the standings!"
I usually see this kind of tactic called Sandbagging
![gif](giphy|l46CyJmS9KUbokzsI|downsized)
The comment we all came here for
"I call them assholes, not sure about tankers."
"I still don’t understand the purpose though. Like, what is actually gained by tanking your rating and winning against lesser skilled drivers? On the occasional scenarios when iRacing shuffles me into an absurdly low noob split, yeah, sometimes I’ll win if I’m not wrecked out, but the racing sucks and there’s no real sense of winning from it. "
"Doing the Lord's work, cheers dude."
"In CALL OF DUTY we call it ""boosting"""
This photo shows it a lot more clearer than the original picture
Where did they tank from? I very often lose to guys 3/400 IR less than me haha
Dang this is absolutely blatant even wtf.

Forgot to add it in the post"
DQ post race doesn't remove iR. It simply sends you to the back and removes all championship points. 
Yeah not sure what they're on about.
0 championship points.
Yes. As of 2024 S1 post race DQs are a thing
"Same thing with the influx of Smurf accounts, in a mid 3k road IR and the amount of people with Black Friday accounts 2 months old with blistering pace and consistency is questionable at best. 

LMP3 at Bathurst this weekend and a few guys with brand new accounts putting in laps in the mid 2:xx range was interesting. Someone gaining 2k plus IR in their first two months is a tell."
"To quote an actual race engineer:

""probably not the best one to win, but a win's a win""

Definitely don't agree with people who tank/Smurf in all multiplayer games."
And we as a team even went out of our way to raise our ir before the race...
We were the 7am EST Saturday slot bottom split
"Please understand, he was a volunteer firefighter
/s"
"Yep I’ve seen people do this even for casual leagues that have different IR groupings in the same race eg masters, over 3.5k, under 3.5k. 

Guy competing in the under 3.5k would always happen to make errors and finish last in official races of 15 minutes whenever his IR approached 3.5k and rarely ever make an error in a 45 minute league race."
Protest
"I didn't even care until someone called him out and he started bitching up a storm about all the hard work they did practicing and on setup, like dude, you're clearly not a 400ir driver."
"Yeah but not to iracing’s bank account it’s not. Smurf accounts still paid to be there. 

Not saying it’s not shitty. Just saying there’s a tangible difference "
You can tell the difference between a bad race and a history of Start & park
You wont mate. iRacing usually gives the benefit of the doubt which will save you. I mean us.
"They're signing up for racing, then not running them on repeat to artificially drop their iRating.

Us normal sucky boys just running badly aren't gonna get DQs."
"I left of the /jk.  Sorry, but I was joking as well as lamenting my diminishing iracing score.. Can it go negative? /JK"
"Money talks. Smurf accounts still have to pay, so iracing unfortunately doesn't care."
"https://preview.redd.it/bfp0wtb0e1ec1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6be313b306b3819f70479813eb75945f3cc0cbd7

Starting last, finishing last, and running no laps is clearly a start & park"
"It’s clearly tanking, no positions or incident points gained in 5 races is extremely difficult to pull off if you actually finished the race."
"That's why I'm terrible at iracing, but we're not tanking or even close to it"
"I don't think you do, I won the Bristol 500 and don't remember getting a certificate"
We got one for P2 at Petit Le Mans.
Oh I bet. I’m usually in a low split and finish around mid pack; I’d say I see these guys every event I’ve been in
I think we were the bottom split on Saturday morning.
"Same with ""smurfing""."
Ballsacking
No sandbagging is what I do. Not qualify so I start at the back of the grid so I can pick and choose my way through first lap carnage instead of getting caught up in or causing it myself. I'm typically one of the faster drivers in my split. Because I'm terrible. But I'm getting better which is what this is all about. I've had several races where I'm last on the grid but still make podium.
reverse boosting is another expression for it maybe
"Sandbagging is harming your own team. A 'sandbag' dragging you down. 

Not really applicable here."
"Wins a win.

Winning is more important to those folks than good racing."
"Starting and finishing position the same. No incident points. No improvement on SR. 

User registered for races and didn’t join. Loses iR. One might be a coincidence. That many in a single day is intentional."
[deleted]
"Okay, yeah. That's clearly tanking"
Ooof at least get in the race and do some laps. This moron went into races didn’t race a lap and lost irating. Can’t get any more clear cut than that.
Team name?
"Does it really matter to them though? They tanked it to get in a lower split. Way more than they would make for the race. They get to feel dominant but now since this is out in the open feel stupid now. Or they’re like fuck it, still won."
You missed the update from IRacing a week or 2 ago. It does actually remove IR now
Finally
"It's not allways that easy, and people could tend to jump to conclusions..
For instance, on of my friends is a long time racer, does karting in RL and has been our ""mad pace man"" in other sims like rfactor and acc - where he has been constantly in the region of the upper 5%.
As rf2 became more and more less interesting for us, our team started to move over to iracing, where most of us already had been racing on officialls anyway. But he was late to the party, but started to sky rocked his way through the lower classes. So ofc, I can understand that an 2kler with the pace of an 5kler can seem sketchy - but it's not allways someone smurfing around."
"Idk how you did in the race, but you deserve a gold medal for that anyways! 🥇"
"Damn, we had the same smurf bs in ours and they got a DQ too. Love to see it"
"There’s a streamer on twitch that does it. Follow botted himself awhile back too. 

He races like only late models and sk mods with a setup shop and even when you look at his results it’ll be like win win win dnf win win win dnf. And the race he dnf always has zero laps completed so he just joins whatever race and quits to lose all the IR. Then he brags about being the bottom split late model champion and says how good the setup shop is. He’s easily a 3-4k short track farmer racing in 800 SOF races with bums.

I asked him about it once, he never even responded, then musta saw the chat after stream and banned me lol. It’s obvious what he’s doing and it’s pretty known at this point, I’m actually kinda surprised this particular shop still gives him setups. Even though honestly he’s probably buying them and pretending he’s a house driver.

League guys are a diff animal. I know some who have like 4k IR but haven’t races an official since 2013 lol. You never know with those guys."
[deleted]
[deleted]
They can still have the money. Just don't allow the smurfs in special events.
They probably don’t even load in. Just register and forfeit… nice to see they got a DQ for that coward tactic.
Gotcha
So lame people do that. What’s the accomplishment lol
They don't get certificates because they're not really special events and are tied into NiS. Found that out when I won the Coke 600. I just made my own.
The DQ is just the warning shot. Hopefully it will stop once the bans come
smurfing is something different. That's racing on a second account.
"That's uh, not sandbagging"
That isn't sandbagging
"That’s a type of ‘sandbagging’ but people normally refer to that sort of behavior being applied to a competitive environment and affecting others. 



Jiu jitsu gyms are notions for keeping their top level talents at lower belt levels in those levels for longer to place higher in competitions."
"Sandbag: to conceal or misrepresent one's true position, potential, or intent especially in order to gain an advantage over.

It’s very applicable here. It means hes purposely not driving to his full ability to gain advantage. Has nothing to do with a team"
Unless you're literally throwing sandbags in the car lol
Not doubting it. Just wondering how high they were to begin with
"No, it represents pace + racecraft. If you are fast, but regularly lose iRating due to wrecking, your racecraft is not good and that’s being reflected in your rating"
[removed]
"I think removing the official win is the real ego blow.  For tankers it's that middle finger and for the pros is the ability for cheating to remove any potential to advertise ""we won*"". "
"Well, it usually comes with a short suspension as well, and longer suspensions if they do it again. I'd say that is an appropriate level of hurt and a good deterrent in the future."
"If it doesn't matter to them, and they still consider it a win, then they are morally set up wrong which I guess they kind of confirmed to be anyway by tanking in the first place lol"
Any chance you can point to that? I was under the impression that with the way ELO works in iRacing that it wasn’t going to happen that way. I would love for iRating to be put back in the pool.
No it doesn't. People keep wanting it to but it breaks the rating system by invalidating the results of every subsequent race. 
iRating and Safety Rating are not altered since it would break any results done after that event before the decision. The DQ simply drops them to the last spot in the race
Source? Last I saw it doesn't remove iR.
"Doesn’t change SR or IR, but it does affect season points/results. I think for a lot of people that will be quite sufficient, particularly with special events"
"FYI for better or worse it's also against the sporting code to call people out by name, so you may want to think about covering your ass in this scenario"
"Mine looks similar to this became I race different cars/tracks almost every race.

I can clean up in some D class GR86, but get cleaned out in IMSA."
How do you prove it’s a Smurf and not two kids sharing one rig? 
A very hollow 24hr win when they actually think about it
"People can't handle not being the best at something and will do anything to get that rush of winning. Tanking, smurfing, cheating etc... most people that do this can't handle running races at their own skill level because they've peaked."
"There is none but the way the elo system is designed you will get to a point where it feels nearly impossible to win so they tank to get a hollow win.
Often you’ll see posts on here saying is this good for a beginner and they’ve got ridiculous stats, again seeking another high as their confidence is so low,"
Well that's Lame
"Sorry I'm new what is ""tanking"""
"No it's ""intentionally"" staying at or losing rank to play in a rank lower than your actual  rank...doesn't matter how you do it."
"Nah it’s playing in games well below your skill level regardless, most games just make it easy with new accounts"
"He (myself) was 1378, ended at 1004."
Please do not call out other users by posting their names or posting videos or images with their name visible
"It also removes championship points which, while unimportant for a special event, is important for any pro qualifiers as even a single 0 week could end their chances of qualifying as it'd almost certainly burn their drop week."
"I mean these guys clearly don’t care about either or they wouldn’t have tanked the IR to get into the easier splits. The win was what mattered. Glad it was revoked, they didn’t deserve it"
Oh interesting yeah I had no idea. Thanks.
Got it ;)
"They race the same.

https://preview.redd.it/7tsa6vwny1ec1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be2489ac57e4376787c3d395c4461e913e1514e7"
Deliberately losing iRating before a special event to get an “easier” split
"Smurfing has a general ""definition"" it's not an iRacing-exclusive term and that is not how the term is used."
It can be used that way but often it’s to maintain the iRating of the main account. You think Max uses his Smurf account to intentionally race against newbs? Nope. It’s to ensure he is in top split when special events like Daytona come along.
Smurfing is using a 2nd not leveled up account.
Not cool then
I should of read the comments my bad but thank you for the answer 🙏
Do you not mean safty rating? The picture shows irating being earned and the safty rating taking the hit.
"Well does he intentionally lose on the second account or is it just an account he uses and it's his actual rank on that account.

He's not surfing and it's not a ""surf account"" if he doesn't intentionally lose. Just a second account which is at a lower rank as that is how he ends up due to public lobbies or whatever he's up to."
"That was the result before the DQ. Having a low iRacing puts you in a lower split, against generally slower competition"
You have no idea what you are talking about guy lol
"A **""smurf""** describes a player in an online game, often highly skilled, that creates another account to play against lower-ranked players.

What you are talking about is literally tanking/sandbagging.

They're different terms. Like, legit different terms.

"" A slang term coined by Warp! and Shlonglor to mean good or famous players using fake names to hide from people then attempting to beat other players.""

So, yes, Max is smurfing in this example, but the OP is just describing tanking. Now, you can smurf and tank at the same time of course, but what max *specifically* does is Smurf. By the nature of racing, he tries to win, but it's more so that he can keep his main account ready for bigger races. 

Now if Max starts tanking, we got a problem."
Please refer to the patrick hammer meme from another reply for how I feel.
"My apologies, I must have had the Terms switched in my head for too long from what people normally use from a different game. After consulting the oracle(google) for guidance, I stand corrected."
"Right before the back straight set your active reset spot, then stop and tow.  It should tow you to the nearest tow spot on the back straight (not to the pits) and start your lap from there.  Anytime you want to restart, use the active reset, stop and tow."
"Are you completing a full lap? ie you have your active reset point before start finish, then do a whole lap. It still says incomplete?"
"you can just pull into the coned off area thats right around the last turn if youre running  the gp track by itself, right where you make that left turn to go from the gp track to nords and hit the exit veh/reset button instead of active reset and that will teleport you to the last pull off spot at the beginning of the long ass back straight of nords.  you gotta stay in the area thats between the cones and hit reset.  which gives you time to warm up your brakes and and tires and not have to fuck with AR or have to drive a lap to make an AR point.  you have to exit the pits and drive the little bit of gp track though

thats how you did it before AR was a thing"
Ok cool I try this.
"Yes.  Then I cross the start/finish to start my lap it says invalid, and then even if I continue back around to the start finish again it’s also marked invalid.  So I can’t ever set a new lap for my delta comparisons.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong on it."
Same thing happens with me. I'll try the tow trick like 8467 mentioned earlier. Active Reset is the best practice tool because it saves a ton of time not having to go all the way around or stop and esc back to the pits. I mapped it to my button box.
And the thing is it wasn’t always like that. When it first came out it worked fine. Then it changed
"I just figured it was always like that, which makes no sense. I've only used iRacing since Summer."
"It does work fine, used it on the same track yesterday successfully. Only thing I found over time is that the reset point can’t be too close to the start/finish (needs more than a few meters). My reset point was roughly where the pit lane entry is. If that’s not it maybe your internet connection was just wonky? Since that also invalidates laps."
I just assume it’s me
You forgot track conditions in your list. Many people completely ignore them when a lot of times that's the key factor. 
"If your driving is roughly the same but the lap times vary a lot then its probably different weather conditions and track state.

But looking at results, top of top split seems to do 1:15s in race or even high 1:14s in quali session.

While the fixed series the top split guys were doing higher 1:15s.

So Id say more to do with your driving than the car setup. But definitely encourage you to still learn and explore the garage menu because understanding the car and trying different things out can only help you improve."
"It's easy

It's always me"
"Yeah, track conditions and weather can create a variance of potentially up to seconds in pace. It's something I didn't pay attention to for the longest time. Now I always record my telemetry/session data through tools like Garage61 so that I can reference the track temperature/wind speed/track conditions(grip) in relation to lap times from my sessions. When I practice for an upcoming week, I'll usually try qual laps + race stints in separate test sessions with the conditions adjusted to get a reference of lap times + any setup adjustments I can make to maximize, whether TC/ABS in GTs or actual suspension settings"
"First thing I look at when I join a session is track conditions so I know roughly what lap time to target. 

Set up is worth probably 3-5 tenths of lap time depending on the length of the track."
"I'm an experienced driver with 10+ years in iracing. If you're interested I offer coaching sessions, first half hour free."
"If you don't know, it's you."
"It’s me, it’s always me."
"I’ve always just assumed it was me.. then yesterday I noticed that my throttle was topping out at 90%, so I fixed that.. 

And now I know it’s just me 😂"
"This may be considered a ""hot take"" on the subject but it is 100% always the driver. People either aren't applying the basic fundamentals correctly or people try to adapt a car to their driving style instead of driving the car how it should be driven. More often than not it's usually the first. Pay for a coaching session and have someone experienced tell you exactly what it is you're doing wrong if you can't figure it out yourself."
"Setup? Most likely not.
Car? No.
You? Probably.
Track conditions? Most probably."
"It's always me that's the problem. I'm not slow, but I always understand that someone else on the exact same setup could be much faster than me. I'll always get faster if I practice."
Nah it’s me
Can be upto a second a lap just in lower temps
"Oh for sure there's a skill gap to cross. I'm usually about 1.5% off the top guys. Charlotte just caught me differently last week, either seconds off PB in one session and purple in another. Do you know if Charlotte specifically is influenced by track conditions? I imagine some tracks are worse than others?"
"Can you please stop making me slow?

K thx bye!"
Combos like the iRacing Weekly Challenge with the MX-5 at Road Atlanta this week where the variance of track temp has been over 10C (between 35-45C from my sessions) can probably easily see a range of 1:34 to 1:36 laps from identical drivers/setups just depending on the combo of conditions
It can be worth significantly more on the back half of the stint (tire temps/fade/too tight)
It can be more than that depending on the track and time of year
"I don't drive gt3s so cant tell you for sure but usually its a pretty linear relationship, cold/clean tracks are faster than hot/high usage tracks.

For a 40ish minute race though I'd imagine you'd see more severe effects from poor track conditions if the circuit itself is naturally harsh on tire wear as your stint goes on."
Yeah lower temps are better
do you have some non microsoft antivirus running?
Same happens with my installation.
 It looks like the CDN point of presence for one of the CDNs in the Germany/Austria region cached a malformed version of the installer. This has been cleared so it should work now for either CDN option.
"Nope, nothing besides good ‘ol microsoft stuff. Also checked firewall and other things but that didn’t seem to have anything to do with it."
"Wait, so I should try to download a fresh installer from the iracing website now and try again? I’ll see if that works."

I’ll try it immediately and hope that it works. The installer worked all the way up to the ‘iracingUI.exe’ file for me until the corrupt error popped up. I’ll try to delete all remaining files on my pc now and use one of those links.
Excellent!  Sorry for the hassle.
"My favorite is people who are in their cockpit and start typing report on repeat. 

When I’m driving I think everything is the other guys fault. But that is not the reality. People should wait until they get out of the car to start sending messages"
Report his rejoin in the 1st race then report his text abuse in the 2nd
"This guy spins, waits for two cars to pass, and then drives into my path. Quits without an apology. The next race, he takes someone out in the chicane. Typically wouldn't be noteworthy. Shit happens and a bit of netcode was involved, but regardless, he entered the vortex of danger and they probably would've collided anyway. Last lap he gets a run out of Les Combes and I'm held to the inside. The rear stepped out, I corrected, and we collided. May not have collided if I didn't dab the throttle after sliding, but it's easy to make those judgements in hindsight. We live and learn. I just thought his reaction afterwards was ironic given that he's no perfect driver."
"That’s an easy report for abusive chat FYI, if you haven’t already I encourage you, no just because of the MF part, but if I recall correctly threatening someone with a report is also considered abusive."
We call these types of people “hot lappers” and they only care about going as quickly as possible with no regard for what’s happening around them.
How do you enable replay in the chat? Mine just shows the complete chat start to finish and doesnt change while spooling
"I ran my first F4 race over the weekend. It was surprisingly fun. I qualified P15, made it up to P6 then over 3 laps got 2 4x one of those being flipped onto my halo. 

Ended up DQ for incidents but I had fun. Lots of respect to open wheel guys. Its a whole other animal compared to the GT cars I usually run"
Fucking hilarious. “Eport”. Pathetic worm dick.
I hope you made two separate eports
It’s really sad how many people are like this. But the thing to remember is 9/10 times they simply are just upset with high adrenaline and lack the emotional intelligence to cope.
"Dealt with a similar dolt yesterday also suffering from MCS. He slid in front of me for the lead, and I didn't check up in time and unfortunately ended up spinning him. I should have apologized, but I'd figure I'd wait until after the race to go over the replay. Instead, he decides to throw a temper tantrum under yellow parking his car on the track blocking me, repeatedly running into my car, like this was some $50k to win race. We go green, and he goes on to hit everything but the winning numbers for the lotto. Straight lining his way through, nearly taking himself and others out several times in the process. Funnily enough, he Dq'd out of the previous race for too many incident points... How ironic."
Threatening a report in chat is comms abuse and is reportable. Report each of his actions separately and include the comms abuse. You don't get to drive like that and be toxic. Online gaming is a mess as is and we pay for the service to keep people straight.
iRacing is pretty good at routing these people out. He will get plenty of reports just from the way he is driving and typing in chat.
F4 is the worst series on iRacing. Convince me otherwise.

"It’s the lack of patience that kills me. Im very patient and all it takes is one muppet to ruin my race. Im putting iracing on pause for the moment and moving on to flight sims for now. 
Shit is annoying as hell"
I'm sure I saw that same livery perform a final lap murder at the Bus Stop in my race too.
Eport
"I had a guy like this in Indy last night. Constantly complaining how terrible everyone was and how he usually races leagues ""where people know what they are doing"". During all this he wrecked me under caution, and then ended my race when he spun out trying to exit the pits and just launched himself across the track."
"Every time I get upset for someone causing an accident I find that as soon as they apologise I am not upset anymore and I am fine even if it causes my race to end. Same thing happens the other way round, when I am at fault, admit it and apologise, pretty much all of the affected drivers have accepted my apology so far.

It would be a much better experience for everyone if we just admit the mistake, said sorry and kept having fun racing with each other."
"Exactly. I don't type or say anything more than ""what was that??"" until I've seen the replay. Even afterwards, if you talk to them like they're an actual human being, things are typically so much more productive. I've learned a lot from positive interactions after an incident, and I try to do the same when I think that someone else did something wrong. They can eat a bag of dicks though if their only response is ""you're a fucking idiot""."
My (voice)chat is always off. It’s splendid.
"Yesterday I made a mental note of a guy who hit me and made a dumb move but ended up crashing himself. Was all set to report it.

After the race, watched the replay and it was my fault lol. The only report was me sliding into his DMs to admit it was my bad."
"It's always best to wait to watch the replay before speaking up, unless it's a ""sorry"".  Almost every time the incident okay out how you thought it did"
This is the way
"The best part about it is his chats, are in themselves, against the sporting code and protestable. Lol gotta love it when they nominate themselves for iRacings Darwin Awards."
"Really? Like the MF is 100% protest able 
But I didn't know to threaten (or to me it's more informing that you will be )reporting them would be considered abuse 

In this case it's abuse because of the MF....but without that I find it hard to believe it would win a protest"
"I don't think that I changed any settings. I think that the complete chat shows when I'm viewing the replay in the original session, but it shows up like this when I launch a saved replay."
Fixed Ferrari gt3 I feel is much worst
Six races in a row?
"I encourage OP to avoid answering this question, as Mods can and have deleted post that have identifiers of drivers and this can be a big one. 

If you had raced him his livery (specially a distinctive as his from the video) and others are enough for you to identify him, no need to give one of his names."
"I turned that shit off before I ever turned a lap in iRacing.

Every voice chat on every site / game / whatever I've ever accidentally left on has been an absolute cesspool of sentient shit.  I didn't want to immediately hate everyone else on the track, so, no voice chat for me either."
"Yeah I wasn't even going to protest the rejoin. After all of the chaos, I was just ready for the week to be over. This + the rejoin though? He got a protest."
[deleted]
"Oh ok, thanks. I never save them completely anyway"
Possibly.
I can get in such a nice hyperfocus while racing. And people chatting / chatting / screaming instantly screw it up. Then I’m done for.
"The trick is to insult politely, and say snarky shit that's not a direct insult.  If they're being dramatic play into it and act like they lost the championship.  The drama makes actual rivals you like to battle with."
"I believe the way the rule is worded, yes. Any harassment on any iRacing platform. 

2.1.3. Emotions will run as high in our races as they do in all competitive environments. However, rude behavior – whether in 
actions behind the wheel, in oral communications through in-Sim chat, or in writing on forums – have no place here."
"So reasoning I would say is while f4 starts are a shit show once you get going after about lap 2 or so people know a touch will kill you, so while accidents happen I feel most do at least try be clean 

In fixed Ferrari cos you have ""body work"" you can kind of shunt people outta the way and only get a small aero damage v lost wheel like if you tried f4"
The only voices I want to hear are the spotter and the ones in my head :)
I think it's good to monitor VC because then you know who is raging and must be avoided

"The Nordschleife is a cruel mistress, lures you in with the promises of epic adventures and bountiful ratings but will devour you if given the chance."
"Ngl, I just saw that on the schedule getting ready to do my Tuesday practice session and I noted that one. I'm not too proud to say I don't have the road racing chops for that behemoth of a track"
Looks about right
"It can be done, usually at the back are more respectful, I don't even bother to fight if car at the back is clearly faster.. it just some entitled prick that think must give them the place at any point when they at your back bumper even though the corner clearly can only fit 1 car/line"
"It might seem odd but the way i learned this track was with the pontiac a couple years ago, its slow enough to be simple, then once you understand where you are on the track it does become so much easier."
You would need to render it separately. The easiest way would be to save your replays and take clips from there. I don't think there's a way to simultaneously render all three without a second computer spectating.
"As others have said, record each separately and then drop them together in whatever editing software you use. Tip from my experience:  When you go back record your tv view (presuming the rest is live), try and record it from exactly the spot your other recordings start.  This makes it much easier to line up correctly when you edit."
"i thought when you said i want a video with three views I thought you wanted a video with 3 views on youtube, lol"
Technically you could save the replay of the race then play the replay in TV 1 camera and record that.  Then you would have to embed that video onto the other video and sync the start/stop time so it played during the video you recorded of the wheel and driver view.  Can that be done?  Probably.  Have I ever tried it?  Nope.
Might be a good question to ask la broca sim racing on YouTube. He presents his videos like a broadcast and would probably know best how to do it.
"I won’t shamelessly plug to show it, I have 6 subs and get about 15 views per video but I did one similar a couple of weeks ago. I forgot to record the cockpit view as the race was happening so when I loaded up the replay I used OBS and recorded the cockpit view, TV1 view and Blimp view in their entirety, separately, then I lined them all up together so I could cut between each one as I went on. I’m sure there is probably an easier, less time-consuming way but it was simple enough to do"
"Yes, I too believe if you want to make it live you need two computers, two accounts and two times the track/car."
Can I ask what tools do you use? How do you export the replays to a different file type(mp4 etc)? Or is done through screen capture?
"Thanks, I’ll take that tip on board 👍🏼"
"Yes it can be done but I was hoping to get it all done in 1 hit, purely to save time!"
Thanks mate. I might drop him a comment!
"So far all my stuff has been done purely from replays but I’m going to start recording each race live. Then if there’s nothing to show instantly delete it. And go again. I just wish I could record it all at once it would save bundles of time!

I’m also now wondering if OBS would record 1 window and not full screen but I’ll have to check it out. For example if it did that then you could either play or be editing videos etc whilst it records. I’m just looking to cut out dead time really!"
"Thanks guys, yeah I was wondering how it was done. I guess I could record the wheel live, the onboard live and then save reply and stitch them together. My only issue with that is they need to be completely in sync. That’s why I thought it’ll be easier to just record them altogether but clearly not. I only have 1 PC!

Thanks though!"
"Screen capture is the easiest way. I don't know if Iracing has any documentation of rendering with code, but i assume it can be done."
"Sync can be done easily using davinci resolve, there's a feature that syncs videos based on the audio waveform."
"Another way to sync would be to make a ""clapper"" signal to sync up using audio.   Like when you're about to leave the pits the first time, you stab the the throttle three times, then you can use that in your replay to sync up your recorded footage."
"Thank you sir, I’ll have to check that one out"
I tried audio sync on capcut but it has never worked right. Maybe I'll try resolve. I mainly just try and sync with things on the track. It's tedious but works well.
"To be honest, I have only used the davinci resolve sync feature for my acoustic guitar + vocals recording covers (with video). So yeah it works great, like I never had to do any micro adjustments, the sync just works.

[Here's the video of how to achieve that.](https://youtu.be/lFr-tKBGvTQ?si=L8LcU3G2Xn1dBHTm)"
"I usually hold just about 30-40% clutch pressure right at the drop of the flag for a very brief moment before fully releasing when I'm confidently away. It'll help minimize the wheelspin you get that slows you down and will give you a better launch overall.

I also hold around 90% throttle while waiting for the start then floor it at the release while doing the slight clutch hold. Bit of a blend in inputs but it's what works best for me. I've always experienced more wheelspin and a slower get away if just holding full throttle and fully releasing the clutch.

Like the above comment said, uphills will exaggerate the wheelspin but I found that general technique to help me"
Slight uphill. Try holding max brake and rev up and release the brake on green light. Used to work for me when I drove mx5
Holding the clutch in too far. Only hold it about halfway - so you just hit full rev counter
"I have an old clip of a standing start before I switched overlay apps and stopped having pedal inputs/telem on my screen. On this specific start, I reached nearly 100% throttle (probably holding at 97-98%) before the flag drop then held the clutch for a bit longer than I would at the release now, but otherwise it's pretty representative. I find that the clutch pressure helps the initial getaway and minimizing the wheelspin, but definitely dumping it as soon as possible once you're off the line gives better overall drive away  


[https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxsyBmRQ9CxdIDMn7GfVm4rCh0MSl6mH02?si=f5qKvMG3cXD9m3wh](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxsyBmRQ9CxdIDMn7GfVm4rCh0MSl6mH02?si=f5qKvMG3cXD9m3wh)"
"Surprised it was enough to make so much difference, but thanks :). I'll give it a go/play around with different launches for this track!"
"Weirdly I haven't been able to repeat such a bad launch, even using the same method as I did in the video. Its worked for me hundreds of times, so I was very shocked when it didn't this time. Waiting until I qualify 4th again to see if its something specific with the grid slot"
"Cheers mate, time to try this in the 5 minutes I've got before the next race😅"
haha good luck! I know some drivers who even map a specific button to hit an exact clutch pressure around 40% so all they have to do is hit the button as soon as they release their actual pedal. Probably requires some third party software or mapping it somehow with your wheel software but apparently is possible
"I can do this through the dual clutch on my wheel actually, I did mess around with it but found that dumping the clutch is quicker in the mazdas. Still confused about my launch bc I tried multiple hill starts on cold tires, still couldn't get the wheels spinning like they did on this start though, very strange"
"Extra blur, distraction, takes valuable fps for very limited graphical change"
"I kind of like it on tracks where I have the headroom to add extra graphics. No real reason to keep it off if you're hitting 200fps anyway, but should be the first thing to go when you don't."
"I use them, they make image more realistic. I racing on 1440p single screen on 120FPS (I turn on v-sync).

People said to turn it off for better performance. And yes, this is help a lot. When I was racing on laptop in the past, I turned off this and many other parameters.

But if I can use them now without big impact, why not?"
Because I’m running in VR and need every frame  I can squeeze out of my poor old 2070 Super 😄
"It’s usually recommended “off” because it requires a disproportionate amount of resources for a relatively minor effect. The juice ain’t worth the squeeze. 

But it sounds like you’ve got more than enough horsepower so there’s no need to be stingy."
"1. Because we really don't use distortion except for small bits of fountains
2. Some folks don't like heat haze

That's it. If you got the headroom, run it."
I myself keep the heat haze off frankly because the sim is extremely overzealous with it. I don't really know the performance impact though.
"It's flavor adders. Or the extra toppings on a pizza. You have the game (crust) the content (sauce) and the game play (cheese). Perfectly fine for a pizza. But add the multiplayer, a buttkicker, and a few graphical extras and low and behold you've now made a supreme pizza. Some people like just cheese some like everything on it. It's all just add-ons. Doesn't make anything better or worse for the most part. For those examples it's like adding parmesan cheese to the pizza. Good yes, necessary not really. I'm I going to love it when it's added and I remember? Yes. But is it something if I forgot I couldn't eat it? Definitely not.... Now I'm hungry again."
Big graphical hit for not much benefit and it causes visual effects that can be distracting.
"""Have you tried just, you know, not being poor?"""
I don’t notice them enough at 1080p to make it worth it.
"If I select these settings, I can see the effects coming from my pc."
"I turn them off on my triples with a 4070 gpu & I have almost everything maxed out and get 100 fps to 125 fps consistently. With them enabled, it drops me under 100."
"In replay settings sure. In-car I don't think it's very noticeable so no real reason to, though if you have that much headroom not much reason not to either.

I'd sooner turn on cockpit mirrors though. (although you might not be able to see them on a single screen, even ultrawide?)"
I’m racing on a potato man.
I don't notice anything while racing. I have 300 fps and them off
"Sorry for the noob question, but how is my 144 HZ monitor able to run 180-190 FPS? Is my entire life a lie?

I’m thinking of upgrading to a 240 Hz ultra wide, but I’m not sure if HZ = FPS, or what the relationship is exactly"
"I have them on, no issues.  I do turn off dynamic objects, though. That one setting kills frame rates more than any other setting without (IMHO) much benefit."
"Because if I turn on heat haze I get a real life heat haze from my PC turning into an electrical bonfire.


Keeps the toes warm tho"
"Are you not using any overlays? If you do, max cars should be at 63 instead of 20. You can draw less, but you should let the system compute all the cars positions unless you never use any overlays.

As for your question, I would turn ssr on before heat haze and distortions, and maybe try a cube map and see if your (clearly incredible) pc can handle that."
And more fps = less latency.
"Yes, but OP runs 200 fps+. Plenty of room to enable these options."
I run them. Screenshot closeups of stock cars on track look great.
I do have a 240hz screen though. However don’t think you need to utilise the full potential hz.
Makes me wish we could have graphics settings per track like we have vehicle controls per car.
"Just Upgraded my life to a 14900k and 4090 from a i7-6700k and a GTX1080....it's a lot better but ya still have to turn useless FPS hogs off even with all the power. I don't know how they are going to do rain 😔.

My man! I’m also VR with the 2070s. It’s been showing its age. Looking forward to getting the 4080s and be able to turn settings back up
"i know the feeling, 1080 here"
And now I’m hungry too damnit
Yeah it’s only an ultrawide (LG 45 OLED) so with the right FOV no chance of see more than half the mirrors. I do switch them around (and get rid of the virtual mirror) when it’s a GT car with a centre console mirror for example though. 👌
"Hz is cycles per second, basically how many times the monitor is able to refresh in a second.  Frames per second is then locked to a maximum of whatever hz your monitor is running at.  Any fps you have beyond that amount is excess not being utilized."
"Yep I’ve got the answer to my question. It’s overwhelmingly turned off to save the loss of fps. 

I’ve already turned them on and am getting use to the heat haze. 😉

Wasn’t as taxing as I thought, but for sure only worth it if you don’t have triples and or a higher res than mine (not hard lol) if your cpu and/or video card isn’t up for it. 🤙"
Just an FYI you can have them disabled in game and enabled in replay to get better screenshots.
You don't. For simracing I find 100 FPS to be the sweet spot between eye candy and smoothness.
"You and me both, i hate having to fine tune for every track."
"Are you in VR, triples, etc?  That’s disappointing to hear. I went with to a 14700k in prep for getting a 4070 ti super. Going from a 2070 super tho where I have to turn down a lot of settings on an ultra wide"
Yeah I’m eyeing that new 4070 Super or 4070 Ti Super. I can’t really justify spending nearly twice as much on the 4080 (Super).
I'm running a 2080ti and it still struggles. It could be because I'm running it on a 650ps and am not utilizing every bit of performance.
"Understood, thank you!"
VR Oculus Quest 2. It's mostly the OSS that kills it. But I will say you can tweak it so slightly by only lowering a cpl things and it's 90fps solid.
"Hehe I'm still running i9-9900KF and 1060 on an OG CV1!  To be fair, I can get 90FPS on most tracks via OpenXR with mostly High details, Ultra shader, CAS, 3 mirrors. Shadows are a big nope.

Upcoming upgrade to 7800X3D/4070 Ti Super/32GB for around $2,000."
"Are you on OpenXR? My 3070 does 90fps pretty solidly with decent graphics settings. Seems weird unless you were running really aggressive super sampling or similar that you'd have issues.


I could maybe see using Godlike in Virtual Desktop (which I believe may only be on Q3?) to get a drastically higher base res could do it and then adding on 8x msaa in iRacing would probably murder performance. Otherwise I feel a 4090 should laugh at iRacing in VR when tuned anywhere near ideal settings and not over blowing something like base res + high in game AA.


You can use OpenXR to do fixed foveated rendering and on Q2 you are much less likely to even notice it's on and get a lot of extra performance as well."
"Yeah I'm OpenXR. I was using Virtual Desktop prior to the 4090 over the Oculus App running and that helped a lot freeing up processing resources, especially with DCS. I was able to keep it in the 50s on Potato settings. I'm still tweaking it, but I get a Solid 90 on the highest resolution with max super sampling. I also use OpenXR toolkit to tweak it a bit more. 

I'm just stating that even with a 4090 in VR you can push iRacing into low FPS if you add all the fancy aesthetics."
"If your not aware, you can take part in solo endurance races  every weekend in IMSA and VRS endurance series, which is a fairly recent change. There is also the IMSA Michelin Pilot challenge which is a 2 hour race every 2 weeks. 

Also around April time the Nurburgring Endurance Championship will start up again, which is a 4 hour race which includes the Porsche Cup as a class and  can also be done solo. 

As for finding a team, hopefully some people will reply to this with some options. I joined my team via reddit :) However, I would definitely recommend you also try the iracing member forums if you haven't already.

Additionally, if your in any discord servers for content creators or anything like that, sometimes they have areas within where you can look for a team. 

Good luck!"
"We have a team on the smaller side if you're not looking to join another faceless discord server with thousands of members and no community. We enter 1-3 teams for every endurance race, and most of us do Porsche cup as well. We drove the 911 at Daytona. Member age is roughly 16-35. iRatings from 1k to 3k (and improving), I think most of us are A or B class. Have Canadian, American and Israeli members. We are still in the process of forming a quality endurance racing effort, where we review race notes and work on strat, so it's a good time to jump in if you want to be a part of that. Let me know if you'd like a link!"
"I started the pro-am endurance discord about a month ago and we just ran our first race at daytona. I pair high-level racers who want to teach with lower level drivers who want to improve, all in a fun and laid back environment.

You can look into Team RedX. They have many teams where you get to choose everything from what you want to drive and when you want to drive it etc. They will do new teams for every week depending on how many drivers signed up for this week and what they want to drive.
"I'm in your same situation and also open to find some teammates. Late 20's, around 2600 irating, B class, have raced a little bit of everything. Maybe we should make a team :P"

Our discord server had about 4-5 cars in this Daytona. And we plan on doing every special event. Have people from 1500 IR to 5000 IR. If you’re interested let me know.
We have a pretty good community that revolves around a league that we run! The System Racing league typically has a few teams the runs for each of the special events each year! we're sure to have a team that is around your iRating and i'm sure we could use someone in a different time zone to help out since most of us live in the US. DM me if you're interested!
"I'm interested, did a similar post to the OP's, so I'm in search for a team as well."
And one of those teams intent wrecked my team in the 24!  
"Hey, check the top level comment I just left. "
"Daytona month will do that yeah. People come back for the 24 and will start heading out after the 500. After this weekend you should see road start going back to normal, as the real 24 would end and all eyes go oval. 

Not that the quality is all that different mind you. It's just more people = tighter splits and tighter splits = more chance of multiple cars running similar laptimes, keeping them close but increasing risk."
I haven't noticed any difference
People asked the same during xmas
"Daytona week is always full of people, so yeah, close fields"
"Driver changes are really simple. The driver pits and holds escape to exit the car. The next driver can then press the race button to enter the car. Driver changes take 30 seconds in the pits but occur at the same time as your regular service so if you're taking a full tank of fuel it makes no difference.

If by car config you mean the setup then no, you can't change it between drivers. The car will be on the same setup for the entire race. The only changes you can make are the usual in car and pit stop settings.

You can have a maximum of 16 drivers usually"
"Drivers changes are easy. When driver 1 stops at the pit stall, he just exits. And driver 2 just clicks race.   
The car setups stays the same for every driver.   
And there can be maximum 16 drivers in one team, minimum 2 otherwise you will be DQ at the end."

"So what happens if you crash? I love to do one with friends. Just to do it. Don't care if I finish last.

But if one crashes and the race is over.  Then that would suck."
"If you are completely new to endurance, maybe do a shorter endurance race, IMSA 2.4 or VRS endurance before taking on a 24 hour race."
"Related to car config: if the previous driver had the ABS/TC set to a certain value, it'll stay there. However the pit limiter will **not** be on."
"Question, me and my son want to do it but from the same computer (different log ins) is this possible?"
"PS Spa is a blast, it was my first 24h too. To piggyback off what some others are saying, you mostly can't change the setup of the car after the race starts, but the GT3s that run at Spa have various adjustments that you can make from the cockpit to suit your driving style"
"Are you guys looking for a few drivers? I'm not sure what the chances are of me doing something like this, but I'm intrigued by the idea. 

I'd love to find a community to race in regardless."
"[This](https://clips.twitch.tv/AuspiciousAmusedBottleWutFace-uGShLhKuq--f7p0K) happened to us 14 hours in causing 7 minutes of damage, and 8 hours later we made it back from P8 to P3. 24 hours is *way* longer than you think it is."
"You will repaired, most of the damage can be repaired."
"That's also what makes it so exciting, because it can all end in a second.

We fought from last place in GT3 to P2 in this Daytona 24, only to be sent into the wall by an LMP 22 hours into the race and ended P5. It was devastating, because we hadn't put a foot wrong all race, but shit happens... It was amazing while it lasted."
There's just something about the way this is written that tells me you have experience here lol
Yeah we’d yell “pit limiter” at each of our drivers as they got in haha. Especially on those overnight stints.
"During our Daytona 24, the ABS changed from 8 to 0 after two stints during the race. In both cases, me and the other driver broke for the first horseshoe and went straight off after locking up"
"I hate that the pit limiter doesn't stay on. Doesn't even seem to make sense from a functional stand point, as far as I know"
"The fun part is that is used to work correctly. During one of the first driver swap races, we had a driver forget to map a pit limiter button and be stuck with it on.

Which means iRacing at some point intentionally changed this behavior, but didn't at least make it a checkbox."
The pit limiter thing is so strange sometimes its on sometimes its not!
"You have to exit the car then log out of iRacing, then your son needs to log in.  You are going to lose a ton of time due to the loading times, but it's possible if you don't care about losing several minutes every time you change drivers."
"I would suggest finding a third driver, so that you can swap accounts during one of his stints.

I don't think iRacing will care if you each technically run some laps on the wrong account, as long as both are registered. They have in the past on their social media promoted teams doing physical driver swaps like this, who definitely were racing across accounts for some of the race."
"If you were going to do this I would log out once and into the other account, any other driver charges I would just do during a regular pit stop. Yes of course this is technically against the rules but would minimize time lost switching accounts. I would run the race logged into the first driver until either repairs are needed or towards the end of the race."
"You can do VRS Endurance series on one PC. You will not be disqualified in the end of the race, but it 3h endurance and you can take a sit behind the wheel with son one by one.

Same is IMSA Endurance Series but it's 2h 40min endurance.

But it's against the rules, but I think nobody will know it, if you do this."
"PPS it wouldn't surprise me if we had rain for GT3s by the time Spa rolls around, so just be aware that's a possibility"
"Anyone is welcome to join. We do a Friday night F4 Series, a Tuesday night Super Formula Series, we keep track of results from all of the special events as a little series for fun. We have people from all over the world and a decent range of irating. Join up sign up to join a team for the next special event or join us is one the the leagues."
"We run multiple teams for pretty much every special event, just sign up and commit to practicing and we'll find a place for you 🙂"
"I have come very close to speeding in the pits because of this, yeah. Lol"
"Interesting.  This happened to 2 of our drivers too.  Nobody was messing with TC, but it was set to 0 twice during our race after driver swaps."
Do you have ABS bound to a rotary dial on your wheel? It causes mine to reset to 0 when my wheel turns on and off
"It used to be, that the pit limiter carried over from the previous driver. A decent amount of people, wo usually don't need it, hadn't bound a button for the pit limiter and ended up not being able to disengage it at the end of the pit lane. So iRacing changed it, to the way it is now."
"I'd argue that how it works now is ""correct."" It's really just a minor thing that everyone needs to get used to.

Something new and neat is that the Ferrari GT3 has its hazard lights on if the pit limiter is on, so you can know whether to yell at your teammate or not."
They’d really only need to do one long pit and account switch though right? Otherwise they could just physically swap out in the seat and not be disqualified after the first swap
"What the view  generally on just registering 1 driver and both using the same account. 

I know it’s probably against the rules but it’s not like we’re not both paying members. 

Sorry never done an enduro so not sure whether it’s technically possible or deemed as a huge no, no"
Just had a thought can we just have two windows log ins with Iracing both open and switch windows log ins? Or would PC melt down?
"Yes this!! None of us had binds but the TV kept going down to 1 and 1. We had to manually adjust it (easy driver). Even when the spotter tried to change it, it only went upto 2....it was weird)"
"That migh be it, especially if it's in continuous mode or whatever it's called. Basically the signal is always on so if ABS 0 was bound to it, it got switched the moment you hop in the car. In most wheels you can change it to only activate on the initial motion of rotating it to another position."
Interesting... seems like there was a pretty easy solution to that problem already
"I'd argue that the correct behavior would be how a real car works.

It still catches me out on occasion, because it only happens the first time you get in since launching the sim. So it can't properly become a habit."
Yeah that's right.
"As a caveat, this would be against iRacing sporting code. It would be account sharing. Not that it matters much in this scenario, just wanted to put that out there in case somebody actually wants to do this. Doubt you'd get caught tho. "
You could do this but you'd get disqualified at the end and lose irating. However you could still gain safety rating.
"You’ll get DSQ in this case as iracing only sees the one driver, and most enduro events longer than the ROAR require a team and multiple drivers"
"It's against the tos, the sporting code and (depending on the event) the event rules.  The long endurance races have minimum driver requirements (usually 2 drivers minimum, I think).  You can do it without a driver change but you will get dq after you finish.  It is also against the sporting code and the terms of service to allow another person to use your iRacing account in a competitive session. 

That said, unless you are on the radio and someone notices and reports you for having two different people driving on your account I don't see how iRacing would ever find out.  I also personally wouldn't care at all unless you were actually soloing and fell asleep and wrecked me.  Another user posted about winning his Daytona split solo and said that the other drivers in the split were cool and supportive, your mileage may vary."
"You could try registering your team with both accounts for the race, driving part of the race on one account and then switching to the other account for the rest of the race. That way you would only lose time from one account switch (and if at some point in the race you take damage, you could do the switch while the car is being repaired to minimize losses). This is probably still against the tos, but if both accounts are registered for the race session, you might be able to argue that it is a grey area if someone complains.
Just be aware that team races have a minimum drive time rule where each registered driver has to drive at least 1/4 of an equal share of the total laps (so for a 2 person team, you would need to drive at least 1/8 of the race on the second account) or the team will be disqualified."
"You should try this in a practice session, but I don't think it will work. If it does come back here and post about it."
So the guy that won alone on the weekend. Did he get DQ’d?
"This sounds like it. Cheers.

My son will definitely crash (and then blame my set up)."
Yes.  He says in the post he got notified of his dq about 30 seconds later.
"Ideally you would both spend a lot of time before the event building the setup together, making one that works for you both."
"Yeah, long story my friend. 12+ years of being his mechanic for karting.

When he wins it’s his driving, when he loses or crashes it’s cause the set up is shit.

He’s one of those types that either wins or bins it first lap."
"Tbh, you'll probably want to sit him and down and talk about that pattern if you plan to get into endurance racing seriously. We've had a guy like that on a past team and it was incredibly frustrating. He would expect people to defer to his decisions and setup choices because he was the fastest, but would rack up incident points, slow downs, accidents to the point where he would be have the slowest stints.  Fuel/tire saving, learning to overtake slower classes, learning to be overtaken by faster classes, knowing when to concede an overtake are all things that seem to be difficult for people with the ""win it or bin it"" attitude. The winner of our D24 started from the pits in 45th. Their fastest lap was at least 0.7 seconds slower than ours. We started 2nd and finished 15th because of overly aggressive driving from our faster driver "
Get a coach. Another set of eyes who knows what they're looking at will get you sorted out in a session or 2. Then you'll find other areas you'll want to improve on so you'll get more coaching and the next thing you know you're the alien on the track ;-).
Hi Phil!
Have you tried garage61 and looking at telemetry! You can also compare faster lap times telemetry
"Have a watch of [this coaching video from Suellio](https://youtu.be/dVfCvMcdMxU?si=z3-w3a6QELpR9ynZ). I would imagine you might be doing the extreme opposite of what he’s trying to teach. 

The person in the video is understeering, and he teaches him to use the brakes to rotate the car, even by trying to make him spin initially! 

Maybe try to relate if you’re already doing the spinning exercise accidentally, and then apply the opposite to your technique. Even if it’s not quite what’s happening to you, it’s a very informative video on understanding how braking effects your car during cornering 🙂"
"Hi Phil, first time?"
Hi Phil!!!
"Hi Phil. I'm Bob.  
I don't spin, I just slide straight off the track.   
Don't be like Bob."
Hi Phil!
"Driving: 
- too much entry speed causing understeer then to compensate too much wheel angle and brake causing oversteer (push / kick phenomenon)
- too tighter line
- too much brake generally 
- confusing pedal inputs
- Trying to copy ‘aliens’ exactly. Don’t do this. Bring your markers back a touch and entry speed as well. 

Technical issues / aids:
- FFB not good enough/ set up right / losing FFB through flex in rig 
- Get a buttkicker

Set up issue:
- This should be last step but may need to work on softening up front or stiffening it depending on your issue

As others have said without telemetry or a video we’re pissing in the wind here trying to nail down issue but will 99.5% be skill related."
"A lot of cars do not perform well under braking while turning. I race mostly stock cars on ovals and trail braking is a must since they will not turn or spin out under braking. I just did the Daytona 24 in the Porche and was surprised at how much I still had to trail brake to avoid spinning on entry (which I did numerous times). 

Back up your corners. Brake before you cut into your entry. Some brake pressure can be applied while turning but minimal at most and only for line correction, not speed."
I would bet $100 that it's because you're downshifting into the final gear too early.
"Hello, Phil?

S🅱️INALLA"
It's while you're braking and your foot is still on the brakes? Are you locking up the rears?
"Can you post a replay or telemetry so we have more information to go on? Does it happen to be synced up with a downshift? Is it on turn in, mid corner or exit?"
"I've considered it, any you'd specifically recommend? 

Really I've no care for becoming the alien especially because I'll ruin the racing for my friends I already drag them into higher SoF, unless we all spend a shed of time and money that we have in varying quantities (often you cannot have both).

I only wish to address this one thing."
[removed]
"I use Racelabs and reload a replay with live telem so I can see what it looks like in the sim, but foolishly I've never bothered to do this for a spin and compare to a similar lap like the one before so that's a good start I'll try to keep it in mind."
"Sounds good, I'll watch this later"
I agree it's skill related. Never heard of push/kick phenomenon before and Google just wants martial arts so I'm not sure what that means but it doesn't feel like I'm coming in hot but I'll do some analysis of good laps to check and compare because just because I don't feel it doesn't mean it's not true. Thanks
Nice explanation 👍
"Late in the braking phase just before the apex, but with the almighty ABS on my side I'm not sure if it's still possible 'lock the rear'. I wonder if I'm downshifting to aggressively or if it's possible to just turn harder than the rear can take if I am trail braking but as it's so infrequent I'm not too sure.

I generally move my BB forward Vs the setups we get from Craig's Setup Shop, 53-53.5% in the M4 GT3 at Daytona this weekend specifically in an attempt to combat my issue but I assume they're already aggressive as they show alien lap times."
I'll try to get one as I usually forget over the next few hours racing in an endurance
"No idea. Everybody recommends Suellio because well, the kid is phenomenal. But I don't know how much he charges for coaching. He does have a lot of videos on YouTube so you might be able to find something there to help. He also has his online course which I am considering getting. it's kind of pricey at $200, but my instinct is it's well worth it considering the overall costs of what I've already spent. Maybe you and your buddies could split the cost and all benefit."
Spoken like a true bottom splitter.
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
Id give a shot at self coaching through looking at telemetry before paying someone. But it's your call
"No problem, analysing your braking trace against the video in the areas it’s happening will be really helpful I’m sure!"
"The video he pointed to is long but great and likely your issue.  Along with that, consider at what stage of the race you don't, as a lighter fuel load affects brake bias."
"Push &  kick is just another way of referring to understeer (push) and oversteer (kick)

Here’s an article on the issue at hand:

https://speedsecrets.com/q-how-do-i-fix-my-car-from-understeering-early-in-the-corner-and-then-snapping-to-oversteer-exiting-it/"
"If it's before the apex then you are either:

1. Trail braking too quickly. Your foot is coming off the brakes too quickly without counteracting the weight shift with the throttle. At this point of braking, all of the weight is at the front of the car, so taking your foot off the brakes too quickly without throttle inputs will kick the rear out a ton.
2. Downshifting too quickly

Also matters if it's a sudden spin or one you just slowly feel coming as you round the corner"
"Look at the telemetry when you’ve spun, did you do a downshift after starting to turn in on that particular lap? 

Also maybe you can soften / dampen that last couple percent of braking and first few percent of throttle. Some calibration apps let you adjust this so that those inputs are more progressive and less linear."
[removed]
"Interesting read, I'll keep this in mind when reviewing the telem. Thanks"
"This is the one!

I am struggling with the same issue and took a friend watching me to point out I am coming out of the trail brake too quickly… by doing this the weight is not getting to the back of the car so you lose traction and spin."
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"Congrats, think mine took a few months. But in three years on iRacing, I have three total wins. Been getting close here lately but I still do dumb shit like spin out on the last lap when in the lead. 

I also seem to get several wins on week 13…when they don’t count towards my ratings 🙁"
"I won my first ever rookie oval race. Maybe a few here and there then nothing for a year or two when I won an an open at Dover. Then nothing for a year or two then won 80 something in 6 months and haven’t won since. 

Funny thing bout iracing is the better you get the harder it is to win. Most people win a race or two in rookies then literally never come close to winning again"
"I've won my ever first race as a rooke in the Mazda! Nice feeling.

I've won 26 races overall, but lately my iRating is getting worse."
"Oof! I pulled third place on my second day, last lap I was watching the guy behind me and used the wall as a breaking zone. Went from 3rd to 9th in a fraction of a second."
"I feel like I know exactly what your talking about. I initially got matched SOF of 1200 or so, but every race kept getting lower and lower until I won. The matchmaking seems to figure out where you are skill wise and pair you with others similar. 

I'm not getting my hopes up that I'll win every race. I really just enjoy setting new best times on each track I try out. That and getting used to new cars is fun when you get it down."
"I love the mazda, but a few days after getting into class D I got some new cars and a few races in, I realize how forgiving that little mazda really is. Its insane how you can beat that car into submission. The other cars Ive been racing in class D will beat YOU into submission. through my last few races, Im sitting happily in the middle of the group and slowly working my way up."
"Youd be correct. Every race has a “strength of field” number. It’s the average IR of everyone in the race. If there’s only enough people to fill one race then it’s called a single split race. If there’s a lot of people it’s not uncommon for it to make several splits that run simultaneously. The higher your IR the higher split you’ll get into but the better the other people will generally be. 

For example I never win anymore because I’m top split pretty much 100% of the time so the people in my races are the actual Coke series drivers and other people good enough to be pro. I don’t race enough to beat them."
Ooooh! So it's based off iRating then. I thought it was purely how you qualified. Honestly I'm not bothered. I really just hope that I start getting paired with drivers who won't immediately screw the pooch on turn 1.
"Oh that’ll always happen. The higher IR people you race with the lack of skill gets replaced with too much ego. I’ve been wrecked more by guys with pro licenses than anyone else.

At least on ovals I feel the best range is like 2nd or 3rd split, maybe around 2500-3000 IR. People at that point are generally good enough where they can keep it together but not so good where they think they are gods gift and can wreck people. You usually can’t fake it until you make it that high IR wise."
That's a good counter. I didn't think of that. Fucks sake lol. The amount of times I've been rear ended because they forgot their tires are cold is staggering.

This is a random shot in the dark but you may want to try deleting and reinstalling your audio drivers.

May try this and the audio update the other person reccomended

"Split the axis in Pit House, then go through the same process for binding right then left. 

With combined axis, both left and right will act as Axis A, which would be set to Primary then swap to Secondary as you’ve experienced.

With split axis, left and right are independent as Axis R and Axis L, which you will bind your Primary to Axis R, then your Secondary to Axis L."
"Other responses are correct, here is a simplified version:


1) Set up clutch as dual axis in pit-house


2) Unassign the second clutch in iracing. The clutch paddles work in tandem / are registered as the same axis. So unassign the secondary clutch before you calibrate. 


3) Calibrate pedals in iracing 


4) For brake and accelerator, do as normal


5) For the clutch, you will be pulling in both paddles on the steering wheel. The blue bar which represents clutch should go up 50% with the first paddle and up to 100% when both paddles are pulled in (or whatever value you set in pit-house for each). 


You now have a dual clutch."
"It's presented as a single axis when you're in bite-point clutch mode. So it just gets registered as your main clutch, not as a secondary as well."
So what could I do to remedy the problem?
Just register it as your main clutch...
"Thanks Sassy. Your spreadsheet fu is something I hope to match one day, let alone your pace."
"Hey! I added an in-lap to your sheet almost a year ago to make it easier!  

Thanks for making this and everything you do for the community."
"So is the In Lap the ""one feature suggestion he couldn't not do""?"
An excellent resource for managing the team on an endurance race. Thanks for creating it.
"Great to see a new version, old one was so awesome to use

First issue i notice with new version is driver colours dont match eg in 1 section driver 1 shows up as purple, in another section Blue and in another section pink, not a big deal but i prefer to have them all match and dont know how to change it"
"Thanks for these changes! We used V0.07 for the Daytona 24 this past weekend and it was an amazing help! I really liked how it allowed us to plan our stints pretty much down to the minute.

I've provided some feedback in another thread here on Reddit, most of which seems to have been addressed with this change! Something I thought of since: The driver availability sheet is broken up into 30-minute blocks from the start of the race. If the race starts @ 12:40. I find it more intuitive to plan my life around the hour mark, especially in a country where our electricity provider implements ""load shedding"". I'd prefer being able to say I'm unavailable from 14:00 - 15:30 instead of needing to mark the 13:40 to 15:40 blocks as unavailable.  


It feels like it would make more sense to start from the timeslot of our race, which tends to be on the hour or half-hour. It also helps to know who in the team will be available to do qualifying."
"Sassy this is brilliant job. I was trying to build something similar for the past couple days and how glad I am to stumble upon your creation.

I know that you work on moving it to proper platform, but I have a request for existing excel solution and idea for the new one: I'm missing maximum stint duration, since without it there is no proper way (at least I can't find it) to get required number of stints. As a nice to have it would be great to have number of mandatory pit stops and pit windows :)"
"Turns out a lot of people were but nobody thought to ask me for it until this weekend lel. About 1/4 the people I showed it to initially mentioned they were already adding it themselves. I don't blame them, *way* easier."
Dunno why you're getting the downvotes but yes. It makes *so much* more sense and I would have done it that way in the first place if I had thought of it. I've been annoyed trying to do the math or reverse engineer lap count from the in-session logs myself plenty of times and it still never occurred to me.
"Huh, don't know how I missed that. Dealing with updating the conditional formatting rules is silly complex. Thanks for the report, I'll figure it out!

Edit: Fixed! There were some conditional formatting rules that were overriding things they shouldn't have been. Managed to eliminate another handful of rules in the process."
"I believe there's something weird with the driver availability too. Trying to set up a new sheet for a 2-driver race and the available in the ""schedule"" tab does not seem to be coming on correctly from the ""driver availability"" tab"
"You could, if you wanted, re-seed the start time for driver availability by changing the value in Driver Availability!D3. It doesn't ***have*** to point at race start from the Overview sheet, nothing else should know or care that you manually changed it. Just make sure it's before the actual race start or the formulas that map clock time to stints will fail.

Also, availability intervals are controlled by the config tab. I think it's column I on config for all versions. You're looking for ""AvailInterval"" which is the interval, in minutes, that you want to use as the basis for everything on the driver availability tab. You could set that to 15 or 60 or whatever you like more than 1/2 hour increments."
"Endurance events are timed. You are given an exact amount of time and the goal is to run as many laps as possible, with as few stops as possible. There is almost never a reason to pit early or short fuel other than *possibly* the final couple stints (which the utility provides a calculator to run scenarios for). 

With that in mind, stint durations are calc'd like this:
`([tank size] / [fuel per lap]) * [lap time]`

Total number of stints is:
`[event duration] / [stint duration]`

To model an event where there is a mandatory amount of pit stops would require an entirely different approach, and is likely a much shorter event with a couple stops. For that sort I usually do this on the fly based on current race conditions with the aid of a fuel calculator like Joel Real Timing, which tells me total fuel required to complete the event, how much fuel I've got in the tank, and when the pit windows are open."
"I did not consider that! That's a great idea. In that case, I'd recommend putting a little ""config"" cell at the top of that sheet. You can add a conditional formatting rule that ensures the time is before race starts to help guide people.

The 30-minute increments are perfectly fine, but having the option to change them is useful."
I never considered making it user configurable but it would dumb easy to make it a configured value now that I'm aware it has value. Will get that in there. Basically just relocating what that hidden field pulls from to elsewhere.

"Well you haven’t really said what you’re looking for. You just said you know about the traits of some cars. 

It’s hard to give a suggestion if you don’t say what you want lol. 

That being said the Ferrari is a pretty good all-around car and makes fun turbo sounds."
"Right now iRacing test drive is available. You can try all GT3 cars for free (maybe not a AUDI from last patch) and more understand than cother person experience described by words.

"Oh sorry. We're looking for a car that is pointy on exit and overall good handling. 

I have ruled out the merc, and the lambo since we all don't like it in general."
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't test drive only available when the servers are down, right?"
"No, around 24h after shutting down main servers."
Thanks that's what I thought. Maybe I'll be lucky and get home and be able to test the gt3s.
Mods let’s get this man his own custom flair
"I've thrown together a little certificate for you. I also have a PDF version if you'd like. Not my greatest work but you deserve something to recognize your greatness.

"This is the most mind fucking thing I’ve ever seen in my life.

iracing disqualified you because the rule was put in place exactly to avoid these scenarios, you knew it, and yet you chose to pay the price to achieve eternal glory.

It must be really uncomfortable to go around with those massive balls of steel."
"You are most definitely insane, but I admire that. Congrats :)"
"Celeritas 88 here, great race man! You deserved the win! 

My invite to the team stands. Shoot me a pm!"
Ffffffff. Kudos!! Someone make this man a PDF award!
"Without even considering the fatigue factor, I couldn’t pull this off because there wouldn’t be enough time in a stop for me to take a shit at some point."
"Lol we were talking about you in our team chat debrief, compliments from us all at Celeritas Sim Racing 🏆"
"How the hell did you even survive, i guess you go numb at some point😂"
"Genuine question, how do you do that with eating and bathroom breaks ? Absolutely mental doing a 24h solo."
"Well done, I usually hate solos because they quit after 4 hours and take up a slot. But sticking around and finishing is awesome."
Where do you actually finish if you get DQ’ed after the finish?
1x away from a drive through penalty too. Good fucking job dude
"Mods, crown this man!

![gif](giphy|okLCopqw6ElCDnIhuS|downsized)"
"This is seriously impressive, what a strange hobby we have"

"Iracing, give this man back his win.  Bro dersvers it"
Bro I watched this race one of my freinds was in it.  We were talking about how freekin crazy it was that a solo won.  Congrats you crazy beast
'99x team incidents and a second driver ain't one
And here you are making me feel like not having friends for a team is just me making excuses…
"That is.. amazing. Well done! What's funniest to me is that you said you hit the wall at 17 hours, yet your fastest lap was 662 out of 896, so that's probably not far off that. Imagine setting you best lap that far in lmao"
"carefully, he’s a hero"
That was a great race matt. You deserved that win after all the code browns
"ok, so your statistics page show that before this split, you started at the first split and already do 92 laps in almost 3 hour. 

so overall  27 hours and almost 1000 laps in one seat , and after all you keep chating in reddit in hours? i hardly belive it, this is not a real world driver swap."
"Lmao 

I am simultaneously laughing at you for your excitement

But I also 100% get exactly how you feel and I am impressed


Pretty fucking insane 😂"
This is so insane that it’s hard to believe. Even several hours straight is no small feat. Congrats you crazy mofo! Must have been a hell of a feeling!
"Full Tilt Virtual Motorsport would be happy to support you solo the Bathurst 12hr coming up in a month if you are interested. This is the kind of crazy shit we can get behind dude.

DM me if you are interested. We can get you set up with setups, livery... hell, I'll get you a custom team IMB jersey sorted for the event if I can."
Jesus christ. Congrats! How many pee bottles? 😂
"Nice job!  And a helluva story. Question though...would you have still won had your original driving partner participated? That is, was he as quick as you or would he have slowed you down, ultimately?"
I expect the rules are in place to avoid controversy with potential health issues? Regardless congrats on the achievement.
You absolutely did. You beautiful fucking legend of a man
"24 hours. 

Ahead by 46 seconds. 

Which means the car behind was actually pushing. But with rest and teammates. 

Sir, please, if I may he so bold to ask;

From what planet do you hail and how long have your people been here?"
Adderall is a helluva drug
"Hats off to you, I did 14 hours of a 24hr Daytona during COVID.

I suffer with muscle problems and it damn near ruined my shoulders.

Have a long rest after a beer (or a non-alcoholic beverage) to celebrate and smile like a champ for a year."
The navy seals are interested in you as a drill sergeant
"I was in your split, mega job man"
So glad I got to be a part of it! Congrats once again on behalf of Camp Jangles Racing Academy!
Someone get this man a watch holy cow. Ref. 116503 Daytona if anyone’s got the coin for it. Congrats OP!
"Absolutely insane, I did a 12 hour solo once and felt like my shoulders were going to fall off. Well played sir"
Bravo and well done. You are insane though lol
You crazy bastard 😅
You are absolutely insane. Congrats dude!
"That’s insane. I don’t have enough mental discipline or stamina for that matter, for a regular driver stint!"
I thought a two man team was tough. Congrats.
"Cracked, congrats"
What food did you manage to eat while driving? Congrats btw!
Dude 😨
Mate well done! Thats an epic effort!
"Started iracing early march and my plan is to do a daytona 24h and a nordscheilfe 24h as well both in LMP

This post makes me wanna farm my SR ASAP to start training"
This is amazing. I wouldn't manage to pull the 24h off by themselves let alone the win 😂 kudos and congratulations!
How to you go to the toilet? Do I want to know?
Just here to say I’m extremely impressed. Hats off to you sir.
"GZ man, sad for DQ.  


u/rhilXD i understand how hard it was, did 18h Spa solo on Assetto Corsa myself (GT3 porsche) on VR, 12-14h was the hardest part for me as i had to fight sleepness"
🤘🫶
"Congrats. That's impressive. Just finishing solo is an accomplishment let alone a win. 

Now do Nurburgring 24 and tell us how you feel at the end of it. :D"
"Fellow Matt here, this comes as no surprise a Matt did this

Seriously though, absolutely amazing. You're insane lmao"
"Holy shit, Matt. Great fucking race."
"I'd like to add to this achievement, Matt not only won it by himself but also managed to get just 6 car contacts the WHOLE 24HR RACE! As a post you'll see by me recently it shows a particular team getting over 600inc and most were car contacts. 
Mate well done and your skill to do all 24hrs without totalling half the GT3 field should be commended."
iRonMan.
We were in your split Matt! It was crazy seeing you make it. Congrats bud!
"Have you finally gone to bed yet? 😂

Massive congrats, “The Insane” title achieved."
"Am I seeing it right, did you also finish with 99 out of 100 incident points? You must have been shitting it being at 99 knowing one tiny mistake would cost you the whole thing."
You genuine fucking beast. Congrats. I hope someone makes a YouTube video on you.
" Congrats! Also, 1x away from the penalty which probably would have put you in 2nd."
What a legend
Make a YouTube video about this it would go big
This man fucks.
Bruv….legend shit. I’m glad the lobby was hyping you up instead of being asses
"Now this is (sim)racing! Congrats, mate, that's insane. Team iR better give you *something* for a performance like that."
![img](avatar_exp|78562874|bravo)
"Holy shit, congrats dude! 

We had a solo legend in our split as well, except he really turned into a zombie past halfway until about 2 hours from the end where he picked up the pace again. He crossed the line P36 overall

Insane achievement, even tho you got DQ'd i guarantee everyone in your split will remember this performance. Certified Legend"
Someone get the dev team to paint his number on the start finish wall because he just made history
Holy hell. Thats one hell of a feat. I saw the comment where your partner dropped. Insane if you to decide to do it solo and win. I hope they give you the win somehow!
Look at this guy winning 24h. Meanwhile me after a 45 intense session at brands hatch I'm sweating and feeling tired. Hats off.
What a legend 
"I was in this race/split. Was absolutely amazing watching OP drive the 24 hour solo. I did 2 triple and one quad stint and thought that was alot. 

Was a middle split but holy shit was it clean and fast racing. I've done almost 20 various special events in iracing and this was by far the best one."
"Wait, your surname is Sherlock? And 24 hours without shitting?

It gives a new meaning to “no shit Sherlock”!

Congrats on the win."
I dont play but this is legendary
"Uuuu great achievement! I remember driving for 16hour straight in real car ( sound 1200km ) and it was devastating for me… 24h… on simrig that is less comfortable, while racing… mate great job!"
"There is a streamer who does Bathurst 12 hour solo. Never come across someone do a 24. Amazing effort and to win, well fair play. You are crazy 😂 I’m tired just thinking about it"
"Not an official series, Basic Ollie (YouTube streamer) did a 24hr hosted race at nurbs last year with 60 of us, not all made it to the end. We raised 11k for charity and the race rules had mandatory rest breaks for health and safety grounds. No driver changes.

Congratulations on the effort."
"I say we sign a petition for him. If they can allow cheaters to keep their victory, they can do the same for him."
I was impressed when Matt Malone did Bathurst 12hr solo. This is next level!
"Congrats, OP! Major achievement!

I also did it solo this year, but in VR. Granted, i didn't win it like you did.

I drove GT3 and got 701 laps done. Also, 23 and half hours driven. Finished p8, and immediately got DSQed because the driver requirements. It's what it is.

Congrats again! 👏"
You’ve won chad of the year and we’re only in the 1st month
Madlad. That’s awesome
Dude congrats!!! I've had 6 individuals since 2015 run our 24h kart races solo. However they didn't win!! The amount of focus needed to keep a pace going to win is insane. You should be on the iracing wall of fame.
"We were in your split, nice job man! Congratulations!"
Well deserved! I was going to make you a certificate but some-one already has
"Just for you to get DQed for your accomplishment. What a joke. I get it, its a team race but you shouldn't get punished for doing it imo. It's not like the driver change takes longer then not."
i was in your split. we started on pole lol. tech issue caused is to slip back to the back. fought through to 10th. we were all amazed you kept going
"This is now my all-time favorite iRacing story.

Hell ya, dude"
"Don't want to rain on your parade. Congrats OP! This is wild. But for people in the future, please don't do this in special events.  


I get that this is impressive, but it's kinda fucked up at the same time. It's not following the rules which is why you get disqualified. So you maybe had an entirely clean race but if you had ANY incident with any other car in those entire 24 hours that caused them damage or ruined their race, it's kind of rude.

Props to you for doing this and I think it's really impressive, but I think this should be protestable in events.  


We had LMP2's in my split that joined solo, caused accidents and then left. I'd be furious if I got in an accident with someone solo because they're not actually competing at that point within the race rules."
W
i ran it with 2 others and it was hell. your a fucking legend.
"Amazing effort! Wow. Congratulations! If you are disqualified, does that mean you don’t get any Safety Racing or anything at all either? I haven’t been on in over a year. I’m itching to get back though."
Insane & futile. But sometimes that's what this world needs. Kudos to you!
"absolutely brilliant stuff Matt and I've already added you to my ""Studied"" drivers :)

btw, here's an idea for the future should you ever decide to do something this insane again.  set up a second iRacing account, register both, and then switch \_accounts\_ half way through the race while pitting."
Please telle me you're joking about this being a waste of time and the balls of steel was referring to the complicated toilet situation in this story...
This is pretty amazing. Also 1x short of a drive through must have been a bit nerve wracking. 1 tire off in the bus stop and you might’ve finished 2nd after all of that. Really awesome job!
"I was there, congrats good sir!"
Dang dude. You’re cracked! I’m in a discord with a bunch of endurance guys from all over and we do all the 24s so if you still don’t have a group PM me I’ll send ya the discord.
You’re a legend Matt!!!
"This is now number 9 on the most updooted posts on this sub reddit. It should be 1st, just like how you finished. Mega drive!"
"i once drove for 3 hours race solo, it was hard. imagine 24h solo 💀💀"
"You freaking legend, Matt. You won that race and won our hearts in that. Looking forward to racing with you again

I should make you a custom livery sponsored by Tylenol, Imodium, and Red Bull"
"Sponsored by

Cocaine"
You win iracing!
If u didn't drop ur iRating before the race to stay with 1k guys u did amazing job ! Cause there was a lot of weak dumbs who usually have 5k and before the race droped to 1k just for the win.
"Dude that's amazing, congratulations."
Goddamn man that's nuts.
What you did could be fatal as it may result with ceased blood circulation etc. There are many examples in South Asia that youngsters are dying just because over hours in front of games. At least better you do some exercises during pits 😊
"I was crying on the Reddit about my team mate leave the race early I have finish the race for last 3 hours, you are truly amazing, 3 hours straight is so hard for me 24 hours straight omg"
"YOOOOOO MATT WHATS GOOD BUDDY CONGRATS AGAIN, I WAS IN YOUR SPLIT IN THE STEPPING STONE MOTORSPORTS CAR"
"Love it man, console player myself,but one of my buddies let me check out iRacing on his setup a while back. I was just in a practice session in the MX5 Cup car on Laguna Seca, but surprised him by turning good laps after 2-3 laps and not completely losing it until 11 laps in and trying to overdrive the chicane. Told him it helped that I have turned so many laps on Forza and GT that I knew my corner speeds already"
"Congrats on the win! Sorry iRacing doesn't allow solo entries. If you're looking for a team to keep you from DQing future events, you should take a look at Purple Sector Motorsports! We have a year long championship where we compile our results throughout the year. We also have several teams running each special event, and we have guys running other endurance series like NEC and BMW Sim Cup.

"That’s insane man. I was doing it in a 2 man team and by the time morning came, I was so tired I was driving on autopilot not even realizing what I was doing. Congrats!"
Crazy... Congratulations. this is a win in my book !
"DQ or not, nobody is taking this away from you.

That is both clinically insane, and impressive as hell! Congratulations."
They disqualified you because you won alone. Why did it let you join then
This should have been a Mr.Beast video
This has to be some kind of sim racing world record winning this event solo!
"Nobody is asking so I’m gonna, how did you piss and shit?"
So you were disqualified and won nothing?
I thought you can solo these long events?
"congratulations man, great achievement.  But I can not go without saying, you HAVE to fix your way of making screenshots. taking a screenshot, on your phone, of a picture taken by your phone, does not count as a screenshot."
No you got Dqd. Also you had a 2nd team member whom had a significantly lower Ir than yourself that didnt set a lap. So you tanked the sof and they didnt complete the fair share rule. So you got Dqd for two separate offences
Who's going to tell him?
You might have finished 1st but you didn’t win if you check results 😉 good job on solo a24hr race tho
">And yes sadly you do get disqualified about 20/30seconds after you win!!

Sounds like you didn't win, then

Haha but seriously, well done"
That's an incredible achievement! I would definately join your team 😆 congratz!
Did you wear a diaper? How did this work
Crazy
Insane man. Huge congratulations. I need a smoke break after a 40 lap race….
How the hell did you do that ha. Amazing.
What in the actual f-
did u piss in a bucket while driving?
Ooof. -97 irating :(
"Legend, I’ve always wondered what it’d be like to try that haha"
My iracing team is looking for drivers so if you are interested then we have a spot
"Were you in the Friday -5GMT time slot by chance?   We had someone in our split soloing the race, and our team was definitely rooting for him…not sure who it was or how he finished."
Did Max Verstappen end up winning it?
"Um, where did the pee pee and poo poo go?"
Did you lose irating from the disqualification and if so how much?
How much Adderall
"Just how underrated are you?! It's damn near impossible to win as an accurately rated team with all the smurfs, let alone solo.


Definitely not taking anything away from the accomplishment of running a clean race solo, but just seems unlikely to even be possible to win if you're accurately rated these days.


Also definitely not accusing you of tanking or smurfing, to be clear. There are plenty of people who just haven't reached an accurate rating yet."
couldn’t he have just done a real world driver swap? Not that hard to fake
"Shame you'll get DQed but nevertheless big congrats! Most people that go for ""solo"" endurance wins get someone to do a stint or two until they cover the min lap requirement so that their win still counts."
Don’t you get disqualified for doing it solo??
I want to see the results page for that event. For what happened to your SR and IR.
How the fuck
"Everybody worried about this man's shit, like are your bodies that messed up that you can't easily go 24hrs without shitting if you had to without discomfort or shitting yourself."
"Congrats thats so badass. I wanted to do this for years and so have a few of my friends, now that i know i wont get kicked, and only be disqualified by iRacings Fun Police... I will take on the challenge and stream it live why not! If i die i die"
Why do you get DQ'd after you win?
"Great job! How did you not simply fall asleep after the first 16 hours? I find that I get very tired after a few hours in the zone. I managed to do a 4 hour NEC, but it was hard to concentrate in the end."
"103 incident points. Very impressive, but ah man just over the limit. That must've been annoying."
"Shame you got dqed
Mat Malone handled it by creating a second account for himself to swap with so he could both drive solo and swap drivers.
It was legal, at least back then, to have two accounts
Congrats anyway 👏"
And so close to a penalty too!
Wait what. So did u win or not? Why would it allow you to race it all to kick you at the end? Hope it didn't take that away.

Odds are it was multiple people on one sim. Do we have any proof of that? Lol
How is that even possible?? Is there a break at 12 hours or something lol??
"How did you not eat, drink, or poop in the race for 24 hours"
Thought it required a minimum of 2 drivers to even be able to participate and you need to give the other person fair enough time to even make it official?
Has anyone ever solo won a 24 hour special event before?
"we need an exclusive ""this guy fuckkkss"" flair for OP"
YES!
"Thank you so much!!

That means so much and yes please to the pdf!

🥰🥳🏆"
"Yess, this is absolutely needed for this man. I was in his split. Was a blast of a race all around. 37 out of 46 cars finished the race. Clean all around both gt3 and gtp. About halfway through it turned into a party. Everyone bullshiting in all teams and cheering Matt on. The 88 car and myself friendly taunting eachother as we tried to claw back from a 5 lap mandatory repair and 2 lap optional. 7 laps doen, we finished within a minute of 4th and 3rd place. Best race I've had on iracing in 11 years."
"Dude you include the date on there too!

Edit:never mind I'm stupid lol."
I’m not familiar with the rules. Was he DQ’d for not swapping drivers at any point during the race?
I’m offering the rest of my life to try and carry one for him. Anyone else?
"> It must be really uncomfortable to go around with those massive balls of steel.

I'm failing to see how wasting 24 hours of your life constitutes as ""balls of steel"" instead of a tiny brain."
Deffo insane after the last 24 hours! 😂
Hell yes 🙌
"#774 ferrari here.. congrats on 3rd, we tried for 20 hours to catch back up. Just couldn't get it done lol. Good job beating the #78 who wrecked us like 3 or 4 hours in."
Please 🙏🏻
And custom flair
I do graphic design as a hobby. I'll get one made all nice. Reporting back soon.
Why a PDF award? Because he a-do-be crazy!
"All that caffeine would lead to a big dump, for sure...

But maybe he had a bucket under the bucket seat?"
Imodium is the secret to stop the need for poo’ing 🫡
Dont need to shift when you all you do is drink liquids haha
Thanks 🙏🏻 I’m glad I completed the 24 and was still driving up to standards….unlike some of the mad people in our split 😅
"Red bull, painkillers and yeh the 17 hour mark is the wall and then it’s all physical pain! I was massively supported by loads of people from other teams"
"Good question, eat/drink while you drive. Toilet during your 48 second pit stop and as I’m a loon take Imodium so you can avoid the..longer toilet trip"
I was actually registered to do it with another person but they dropped out last minute.com. It was either do it solo or not do Daytona and that ain’t an option
First in my mind but yeh I think 5th from last or something like that. You loose irating
I did a daytona 24hr where the winning team didn't complete fair share and it was a little weird seeing the leaders for the last 10 hours get zorched from the standings as they crossed the line.
I got 99 problems but a drive through ain’t one! 😉
And then the GT3 P2 driver just absolutely obliterated his car after he crossed the line.
It was amazing getting to share the hobby while doing an insane thing with so much support from people in the split. Was like having a huge team :)
Please 🙏🏻 gona send a cheeky email tomorrow morning and test the waters 😅
"I hope your friends had a great time!

It’s still sinking in!

I might have been racing solo but most people in the split were supporting me and I dedicated the win to all of them as our team win 🏆"
Honestly i made so many great friends during the event. It was such a great group of people. The banter and support was none stop as well as the odd explosion when someone was sent to the shadow realm 😅
It's because temps are at their lowest then. Makes faster laptimes. Still mighty impressive to be able to drive fast enough to make use of the low temps when 17 hours in.
Damn!!! I hadn’t looked at the stats yet 😂 apparently I have a damn good auto pilot 🏆
-#21 caddy
"Fooook! When you put it like that :o 


Hand on heart no real world driver swap. I was chatting while driving with everyone in the split throughout. 

That’s all me baby and I loved it!!"
Might have had an ‘small’ crash in the 3 hour race if small is the car being totalled on the tires on the inside of T1. I was carefully of them for the full 24 hour one!
Honestly still sinking in. I didn’t believe it would happen until the last couple of mins!
Message sent 🫡
"😂😂 lucky zero, had my trusty pee bush just outside 👌"
"Thanks 🙏🏻 

I would love to say yes as in honesty I didn’t win because I was fast. My average lap time was a 1min 36 which is nothing to shout about and nowhere near the fastest in the split. I got very lucky with really light damage from the accidents I did have which was just luck of the draw and easily could have been meat balls and going lap downs with required repairs. 

Faster cars in the loby got into a lot more crash’s and would then be closing me down before crashing again, while I plodded on letting people past and trying to survive. A proper tortoise and the hare!

 I’m not sure if my original partner would have had the consistency over the 24 hours. But we would have then had two people to share the workload which would have helped as some of my scrapes where due to fatigue. 

No driver swaps also meant that I knew the car, track and the other drivers which is an advantage. 

A lot of luck involved in this win in the first place so you never know we could have got lucky again 🤔"
"I can deffo believe that! It’s not the healthiest thing to do, but once in a blue moon 😅

Thank very much 🙏🏻"
"No way, you’d crash so hard and make a ton of mistakes after that long."
"Pro plus, red bull, Imodium, Tylenol, kitkats and a steady amount of water 💧"
"Thanks!! 14 hours is no joke either so hats off to you to!! Can only imadgin the pain if you had problems be for you did that in sore enough as it is!

One bottle of champagne and a chinese takeaway to celebrate in style"
Thanks 🙏🏻 everyone is the split gave so much support. It was an epic team win! 🏆
Thanks very much 🙏🏻 I hope you and the team had a great race!
"I might have had a little look at fake Daytona watches, feels like a once in a life time achievement. Thinking of framing my shoes gloves and a picture of the car. The watch would be the cherry on the cake!"
"Thanks 🙏🏻 
I feel you! 
I turned the force feed back down from 6.5 to 3 to try and save what I could 😅"
Thanks!! 🙏🏻
"I kept it stupidly simple food wise. Kit Kat chunkies as there easy to eat while driving and a decent size. 

I think I had 10 of them and 4 cans of red bull"
Thanks 🙏🏻 I can’t believe it came together in the end!
"If your new I would highly recommend starting with the Daytona 24 hour as it’s a much more forgiving track. The Nordscheilfe isn’t called the green hell for nothing :)

My whole mantra with iracing is P10 racing. Race safe, fun and be consistent. Let other people make the mistakes and you can wave as you drive on by!"
"Yh do the Nords 24 in an LMP, an exclusively GT event"
"Thanks 🙏🏻 it’s honestly still sinking in! I’m buzzing 🥳🏆 

Honestly the 24 hour on its own was insane in both enjoyment and how physically and mentally challenging it was. 

Being in the lead and the win being on the table and dangling in front of me ramped up the pressure to another level. It was epic nuts. Always thinking am I going quick enough, how quick is everyone else going and I was not the quickest driver by a long shot so people were closing me down and a lot of traffic wanting to unlap itself. 

The split were brilliant at supporting me and we had an amazing time!!

Best iracing event I’ve ever done!"
‘Simple’ 😅 you get a 48 second pit stop every 50ish mins. I was drinking water very slowly when I knew I was going to need a wee on the next pit stop I would drink a load of water so that I was bursting for a wee when I stopped. Run outside very quickly do the business and then dive back into the rig in time for the crew chief to say go go go!
"i'm picturing this
https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/fxyxt7/24_hour_race_all_sorted_i_guess/"
Thank you very much 🙏🏻🏆
"Thanks very much! Honestly I agree so whole heartedly, just finishing would have been enough and honestly I was nowhere near the fastest and could feel the win slipping through my fingers for hours!

😅😅😅 I think the N24 would be a whole different animal at least Daytonas only got 5 real corners and lots of straights for trying to ‘relax’"
Thanks fellow Matt! As a Matt you know we are built of strong stuff and yuppp I am deffo a bit crazy!
Thank you very much!!! A once in a lifetime race! Couldn’t have done it without the support from the other people in the race. They were great from start to finish has made me fall even deeper in love with iRacing….if that was possible
"Thank you so much for pointing this out to me!! I really try to be a gentleman racer and race as fair as I humanly can! 

Thanks again!!!"
Love it!!! 🥰
"Thanks!! I hope you and your team had a great race. 

I couldn’t have done it without all the support I got from the split!!"
"I slept like a log!!!
Thank you very much!! 🥳🏆🥳"
Honestly it made the last 30mins absolute mental torture because I could feel the win slipping through my fingers! So many highs and lows emotionally
"Thanks 🙏🏻 

Haha I have saved the whole recording so if someone wants to they can 🫡"
"Thanks 🙏🏻 

I know right! I was bricking one as I got closer and closer to 100x I was driving so carefully and letting everyone pass to be double sure no silly contact. 

The other cars in the split were deffo faster so if we had been close on track it would have been over for me"
Thanks!
"I’ve got the replay saved. But I’ve never made a YouTube video before!

It would make one hell of a video tho!"
🫶
"Thanks!!!

Honestly the lobby was one of the best things about it. The best group of people I’ve ever raced with and a couple of nuts like myself sprinkled in for good measure 😂 I couldn’t have done it without the love and support they gave me!"
"Love it!! Thanks very much!!

It would be epic for them to give me the nod! 

iRacing are hero’s for successfully running yet another bug free 24 hour race unlike their competitors 😂"
Thanks very much 🫡
"Thanks very much 🫶

Hell yes!! I deffo understand that zombie auto pilot bit! I deffo flagged after 17 hour but the lobby kept supporting me and believing and I got very lucky with how it panned out!

Thanks again!"
Thanks man! That would be foooookin epic. I guess 27 is my lucky number now! What a way to find that out 😂
"Thanks very much!!
Yeh real world shits always got to be done over sim racing so it wasn’t an issue. Just meant it was time for me to step up out on my big boy racing shoes and then leave them on for a lot longer than I thought I would have to 😂😂
Move emailed iracing just to see what they say. God loves a chancer!!"
"Thanks 🙏🏻 
Haha I was sweating and so far past tired and broken it’s hard to put into words. I don’t know if it’s an over share could also smell myself which wasn’t the most fun as I was ‘trapped’ with myself for along time 😂"
Thanks 🙏🏻
"I hope you and your team had a great race!!

Thanks very very much 🫡 triple and quad stints ain’t no joke either!! Especially with the pressure that if you mess up your messing it up for your team at least I could roll with the if I die I die. 

It was such a good split, the best group of people, banter, support and the highs and lows. 

Best race I’ve ever been involved with"
"😂😂😂

Honestly it’s the first time I’ve approved of no shit sherlock jokes as it’s sodding true 😂😂

Thanks 🙏🏻🏆"
Thanks 🙏🏻 iRacing is the ONE if you want to get as close to real life racing but without the risk to life and your wallet…..well maybe a little risk to your wallet
"Thanks very much 🫡

Damn!!!! 16 hours in the real world is no joke as there’s real risk! Most done irl is 10hours in Austria all on the Bruce highway…pulled out of the campsite and the sat nav no joke said in 997km turn left 

Can confirm sim rig not as comfortable, I’m gona be making a lot of changes to the rig to get it much better for endurance"
"Fair play to them, 12 hours with no mistakes as the wall as just waiting to welcome you to the shadow realm! 

Epic if I have a world first 😂

Thanks very much and yeh the tiredness is real I’m not gone lie. It’s going to take ma a couple of days to catch up!"
"I love Basic Ollie 🫶

That would have been an epic race and sounds like for an epic cause!!
Glad they had mandatory breaks….makes it a little bit more human! And deffo makes it safer!!

Thanks very much!!"
"Hell yes 🙌 
I have sent iRacing an email about it because you miss every shot you don’t take!"
"Another extreme Matt 😎

Thanks!"
"Thanks 🙏🏻 

Holy shit I can only imadgin how sore we were from doing it in VR! I take my racing cap off to you!!

An epic achievement!!

Thanks again"
I do my best 😂🥳
Thanks!! Amazingly crazy when you look back at it!
"Thanks very much 🙏🏻

Fair play karting for 24 hours is insane, the physical side of that must be intense!

Would love to be on the hall of fame! iRacing might thing it’s a crazy dangerous tho :S"
Thanks!! I hope you and your team had a great time 🥳
Thanks very much 🫶
"also you can join our team. we had great pace and qualified on pole, but one of our drivers pc froze in the bus stop, from there it was pretty much a fight to get back to the top 10"
"Thanks 🙏🏻 

Proof you can win whatever the odds and even when your not the fastest in the split by miles"
"Thanks very much! I lost 91 irating and gained 1.6 safety rating which I will be spending at the Nurburgring this week 😂😂

Hope to see you back on the track"
"Thanks very much!!

What is a studied driver??? 

That’s not a bad shout and would mean I could keep the win. Doubt I will ever get a special event win again, 1 used all my luck and damn near broke my nerves 😅"
"Cheers! 🥂 

Yeh the 1x to go was like the last 20 laps. It had me shitting myself that I was gona make some tiny mistake or get clipped by the faster cars unlapping themselves as I was not the quickest in the split by a long way!"
Not only did he legit race the whole time he talked cheerfully the whole time about it. The whole lobby was in awe!
Thanks very much! I hope you and the team had a great time!
Cheers 🥂
"God damn!!! It’s increadible how much it’s blown up!!! 

Thanks!! It’s gona be the best drive of my life!"
"Thanks!!! Everyone in the split won my heart as well!!! The love and support powered me on!!

Hell yes!! 🙌 I would love to see that livery 🫶"
Thanks 🫡🏆
"No tanking for me, it would just feel wrong. I train hard at karate as one of my life’s passions and when your sparring/fighting there is no satisfaction from beating up people who are less skilled only bully’s get a buzz from that, you want to test yourself against people who are your skill level or above. I generally hover around the 2k irating. My whole mantra is P10 racing, P10 is the target anything above that I see as winning, this leads to me being all about consistency and often I come in P5 ish due to others crashing fighting and dieing for positions. From seeing other threads it looks like iracing is getting a load better at punishing people who tank which is great news as we want great skill matched races which leads to close racing which is the best racing :)"
Thanks very much 🙏🏻
"It’s deffo not healthy. I was getting out of the rig at every pit stop and moving and stretching. I also had a second accelerator mapped so that I could stand  and stretch or do gluet bridges while driving. I’m also in pretty good condition as I do karate/gym almost every day. 

But deffo unhealthy. Met some great people who invited me to there team so this might be my one and done 👍"
"Yh, they sat a lot more than 24 hours"
I’m really glad you stuck in out and finished the race!! 3 hours straight is still hard and the end of the race is the most intense part when your already tired!!
"Thanks 🙏🏻 enjoying a celebration chinese meal and bottle of bubbly after I had a shower to wash off the grime!! 

Hope you and your team had an epic 24 🙌"
"I can vouch for PSM, I joined their community some months ago and their network of teams and league entries is phenomenal"
Thank you 🏆
Thanks very much 🙏🏻🏆🙏🏻
I had a team mate when we registered but they dropped out before we started  So then it was either no race or give it a go racing solo as we were registered for the last start time
I have the full iracing reply saved if that helps…it’s kinda long 😂
I kinda hope so! Haven’t heard of anyone else managing to win a 24
"Critical question really!
For pissing you get a 48 second pit stop every 50 mins ish

I took a couple of Imodium so didn’t need to shit during the race. A little bit extreme but you gota do what you gota do!"
"Sadly not. Minimum 2 people for the super long events. 

I believe that you can now do the 2.5 hour races solo but could be wrong!"
I knew that I was gona get DQ’d so I was actually filming that while driving over the finish line. The video is crap with so much engine noise
???
The lobby counted it as a win and that’s enough for me 🏆
Thanks. Was meant to be running with another person but they ditched last minute.com. It was solo and get dq’d or no Daytona and I knew instantly what must be done!
Imodium….no poo no problem 😉
Thanks 🙏🏻
"Nahhhh, no piss near the rig. You’ve got a 48 second pit stop every 50 odd mins 

Run outside and be quick about it 😂 and by run I mean hobble like a broken drunk person (drunk on tiredness not booze)"
Yupppp. And not even 4.99 safety rating!! Kicking a man while he’s down!
It’s an adventure with many chapters and a lot of highs and lows! I don’t think it would be for everyone and it’s only gets worse the longer you drive! After 17 hours it gets real sucky and the added pressure of leading and so desperately wanting to capture that win made the last hour torture!
"That mad person wasn’t me.

 I was in the 4pm GMT Saturday 

I’m glad your split were cheering them on tho 🥳"
Sadly I’m in a much much much much much lower split than Max Verstappen
Pee pee in the bush outside during 48 second pit stops. I went all in and took Imodium so no poo poo 💩
I lost 91 iracing from the DQ but did gain 1.6 safety rating
"No adderall but a lot of red bull, pro plus and a couple of Imodium near the end and of course water to keep my poor body alive!!!"
"I’m around 2k irating which I thinks about right. My whole mantra is P10 racing. I’m never the fastest but I’m consistent and very good at accident avoidance. To highlight that my fave tracks are Bathurst and Long Beach Island because they are all about safe lap times not ultimate speed.

There were plenty of faster people in the split they just had more crash’s and got unlucky with the required repairs, I got very lucky and my crash’s were light and only a couple of 45 second repairs where I would just add fuel and double stint the tires so I could get full repairs in one pit stop.

A lot of luck went into this win and I was being caught relentlessly by the people behind me another couple of laps and Ross and his team mates would have got me and another couple of hours and other would as well.

I could have…but didn’t. I’m a stubborn man not a smart one 😂
"Thanks. A shame but it hasn’t taken the shine off it, well maybe 0.0001% as you know we love those achievements and the stats, I’ve sent iRacing a gooey email to see what they say 😂"
Sadly yeh. 20seconds after the finish line. My team mate had to drop out so it was either no Daytona or do it solo. Just finishing would have been good enough for me. The win is just a whole different beast
"https://preview.redd.it/lljg68cw3zdc1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ada90d27a9f8782b08d7091480c4479359f0680a

For you good sir"
Unbreakable will power and foolish over confidence 😂
"Thanks 🙏🏻 

Get ready for some ‘mild physical discomfort’ 😅😅
I was taking strong painkillers and they didn’t stop the pain In honesty. 

If you do go for it solo hit me up I will happily be your hype man and share any learns I can to get you ready to become a legend or die trying!!"
I got DQ’d as you need minimum 2 drivers and both drivers need to do a minimum amount of participation. As I did it solo I got DQ’d 20 seconds after the finish line
"Thanks 🙏🏻 
A lot of pro plus and red bull to keep me awake, after 17 hour you kind go into auto drive. The lobby were amazing and kept checking in with me and supporting me throughout so I dedicated my win to everyone in the split as they were my team for that event so we were all winners!!"
Lmao it was 99 incidents at the finish line. After I stopped someone crashed into me to give me the 4 but the race was lucky finished by that point. Thanks goodness!!
So so so close. Lap 873 was my 99th incident so I was bricking one for a long time!
In my heart and according to everyone in the split I won. However by iRacing rules my team didn’t meet the mandatory minimum participation (you must have at least 2 people doing a minimum % of the race each) I was DQ’d 20 seconds after the finish. According to iRacing I didn’t win but they can’t take it away from me :)
"Ye of little faith. A fair few of the people I was racing are in this thread. No driver changes in real life or in the sim.

I honestly take it as a compliment that it’s that unbelievable 😂 makes it all the more magic/insane"
Grim determination and a lot of support from the other people in the lobby. No break. You get a 48 second pit stop every 50mins ish
I was eating Kit Kat chunkys as food while driving…can’t waste valuable pit stop time 😂 I was drinking water steadily throughout as hydration is half the battle and then red bull but I waited till about 12/14hours in to start drinking the red bull as it makes you need to wee even more. I was running for a wee when desperate during the 48 second pits stops. And I’m crazy so took some Imodium so I wouldn’t need to poop which is a trick a friend taught me at the last days of music festivals when the toilets are grim take Imodium and skip that hell hole!
You’re the only one until someone challenges the claim
"I thought Matt Malone did it a few years back, but was disqualified because at the time they required a driver change? Or was leading when he found out he would be DQ so he quit... Something like that, several years ago."
I came 3rd at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring in the Caddy last year. That's probably about as good as it's gonna get 😂
We've done such things in acc. All people had to drive 24h solo at monza
"Wow, 37 out of 36. You were so clean you synthesized a car out of the aether."
Absolutely had a blast with you guys! That's why we love the enduros and Daytona in particular always seems to be an absolute blast especially with the chat!
"Yes. Longer races require a team ie. Different iracing profiles driving the same car.
There are some races like the imsa endurance that lasts only 2:40 hours where you can register a solo team."
Correct. iRacing requires at least 2 drivers for events like this
Yes. Team Racing events require a % of team sharing the laps.
But so so so pumped with the Win 🏆
I agree. Mans deserves his own custom flair … MODS!!!
MAAAAA! BATHROOM!!!
Probably not caffeine...
"As a former Infantryman, I concur."
"Can we call you ""No Shit Sherlock"""
"I think you still need to shift, tho :p"
"I heard you spoke to Marc during the race, he's the one who invited me to join Celeritas a couple of years ago, it's been a blast so far 👍"
"lol @17 hours being the wall. Huge props dude, I hit a wall around 4-5 hours of straight racing."
You also said Immodium
Respect! You must be exhausted now
"I was going to say! Some Imodium, some Fiber Gummies, and only eating protein bars, might stop you up long enough to get through the 24 hours lol. Congrats!"
Did you wear a diaper?
I’d be emailing iRacing support if I LOST iRating 😂
"Last year my friend and I did the 24 as a 2 driver, it's not the first time, but we agreed it would be our last time as a pair and we would do minimum 3 in the future. I can't even comprehend how you managed it, my body was broken 16 hours in while sharing"
Hopefully you get it
Pitstops must have been intense :D
Yessir nothing but love and respect from the 982 GTMR team
And you got under 100x inc! Dude you totally deserve a trophy for that!
Woops. Thought the multiclass type race IMSA? Did a race there oosie
"I've been on iracing 11 years and hands down that was the best race if been in. From other drivers being safe, well relatively safe for most lol, to the competitiveness to just the bullshitting in chat. 

After doing the quad, I feel if be okay for 6. Anything more than that I'm not so sure I could do. Let alone 24 lol"
"I was driving with refugees when the russo- Ukrainian war started. In Poland to different cities from the country border.
So I had a good reason to drive for so long… average 1 thousand km for several days…
Yeah I was devastated after that…"
"Watch the replay on his channel, some cracking moments like the anom £3k donation for the top 30 to tow back to the pits at turn 1!

It was July 2023 Basic 24. We will do it again this year so keep an eye out and try and grab a slot! You have started your training already!!!"
"Damn that is one hell of a blow :( I’m really glad your team stuck it out to get back to the top 10!! 

24 hour races really are a full adventure with so many twists along the way! 

Thanks for the invite. Ping me your discord 👍"
"yeah and in the end you already did this, we already know, and the DQ is almost an added bonus, a badge of honor.

p.s. Studied driver just means I'm following you in iRacing because you're a damn legend (:"
"Thanks 🙏🏻I’m taking peoples disbelief as a compliment! I couldn’t have done it without the support of the lobby, it was like having a massive team. The banter, support, competitive jesting was next level!

My head of 6th once described me as ‘unfailingly happy’ and I am 100% a chatter box!!

Hope to see you at the next endurance event 🥳"
I will send you the link when I'm done with it 😁
How many pit stops did you make?
Ur busido is respectfull !!! Well done !
And they were playing games with a lot less physical movement of the body that driving a racing game in a cockpit.
Great job by the way
I see. But to disqualify a guy whi wins a 24 hour race is absurd. Iracing and their rules
"You got DQ'd. You didn't win anything. You just crossed the line first.

Impressive performance. But not a win.

Edit: the real reason it's not a win is because you were a 2k driver in a 1.5k split. Your teammate was 1k."
Genius 😂
"Hey congrats to you,  that’s fuckin awesome.   Wish they didn’t strip your W afterwards.   But I’m sure you’re gonna have plenty of offers to join some good teams for future events.   Congrats bro."
"Wow. In my experience, one of the fast but inconsistent teams always gets lucky enough to win a special event. Or there's a smurf team.

We're similarly of the consistent type rather than fast, and we've never won a special event in 10 years."
"I can imagine, trying to stay ahead of the pack after a race that long whilst knowing the slightest offtrack might fuck you? The nerves alone would have probably sent me into a wall."
That sounds miserable haha just find an iRacing league to join and get yourself a team. Remember there is no “I” in iRacing! Wait that’s not right 🤔
"oh my goodness you really went crazy, as they were saying, get you a custom flair and please undisqualify you"
"how did you feel after right after finishing, did you just quit and go to sleep, or id you run to the bathroom faster than usain bolt"
Did a quick google and the closest I can get is an even crazy man than me - Edward Ramaden Hall. He is the only man to have completed the real lift le Man 24 hour race solo in the 1950s!!! What a guy!!
"Oooo. You do get disqualified post race if you don’t meet the minimum participation which is at least two people for the endurance races. 

Damn if he was leading and quit he should have seen it out!"
i think he won the 12 hrs of Bathurst
"From what I remember he won it Solo, but Iracing didn’t like it, which added the implementation of min 2 drivers I believe."
"Matt does the Bathurst 12 solo... he knows he's going to be dq'd but likes the race so much...

He did the 24hr at the weekend with Tony Kanaan's team at TK's som racing centre with Quirk, Tony and a South American who's name escapes me."
"Jesus that an epic effort!! Daytona is an easy track compared to the  Nurburgring!!! 

I tip my hat to you!! 🎩"
"Lol, meant 46"
"Originally it should have been a two person team, but the other drive dropped out after we registered. So it was either solo or no Daytona. I wasn’t missing Daytona"
Makes sense. Thanks!
"His pronoun is us, there are several people in there. LOL"
Does the second driver actually have to do any stints or is it enough just to have another driver registered for the event?
So is your seat covered in all sorts of human excrement now?
![gif](giphy|D5Y3HZfoyF7fG|downsized)
After that you’ll shit bricks.
OG MRE trackpads and peanutbutter..  no need for immodium..
"Normally I would say I’ve heard every joke about no shit sherlock before. But damn you. That is GOLD!!!

Take a gold star ⭐️"
"Oh SHIFT! Lmao, im leaving it lol"
">Celeritas Sim Racing

Hey I did a google about your team, the discord link on your website has expired :("
I wasn’t gona quit and was getting so much support from the people in the split
Yup physically broken but totally buzzing from the win and a lot of caffeine
No but we were joking about that in the split 😂
"I might email them in the morning just to test the waters. 

#givememyWIN"
Why would he get it? Rules are clear. It wouldn't be fair to everyone else who followed the rules. He was a 2.1k driver in a 1.5k split.
A man can dream
"Very!!! 48 seconds of freedom! Do you want to pee, get more water, stretch or get more pain killers/immodoum/pro plus as with racing gloves on it’s hard work!"
I was bricking one about the final 1x as Ross was closing. Could feel the win so close but could so easily slip away!
You a legend!!
Hell yes 🙌 my kinda vibe!! Will deffo check it out and try for a spot
https://discord.com/invite/8GkEeGFw
"Good question! I would have to double check the replay footage to say exactly. 

 But I think it’s gona be 28/29 full pit stops and maybe one more as I did a 6 gallon splash and dash at the very end. 

The fuel lasts around 50 ish minutes. And then the pit stops last 48 seconds stationary time"
I wouldn’t have it any other way. Thanks very much  🙏🏻🥋
Yeh I would really love it if they gave me my win back! Would be special!
So what's to stop an 8k driver to get a bunch of 0.5k drivers on his team just to get into a 1.5k split and just let no one else drive?
"It’s a win, DQ comes after the race. Should email iRacing and argue his case"
"> You got DQ'd. You didn't win anything. You just crossed the line first.
> 
> Impressive performance. But not a win.

He raced a race, didn't cheat, and came in first. I think in every rational person's mind, he won the race - even if iRacing isn't going to display it as such."
"Thanks 🥳. I wish they didn’t as well, but I’m a glass half full guy, I know and the all the drivers in the split know who won and we celebrated as a split as I counted them as my team for the race and they were epic! 
The only let down was the DQ is quicker than everyone thought it would be and we didn’t get our group picture on the start line which is a shame!! 
I have a few tasty offer already. Looking forward to the next team event and doing a slightly less insane endurance event. 

It’s still an epic box ticked and it’s going firmly on my CV as I’m proud as fuck"
"Yeh it did make the last part of the race very very stressful! The pack were chasing me for the last 4 hours and catching quickly. The mental battle was probably harder than the physical one!

I have always struggled to stay composed when leading races and normal do end up throwing it in a wall. The split were epic for cheering me on and encouraging me, I couldn’t have done it without everyone! I dedicated the win to everyone in the split as they were my team!"
"That's because it's ""eyeracing"""
"😂😂😂

I’ve found a couple of great teams so that my next experience will be a little less grim!

However I’m also be approached about doing the 12 hours of Bathurst solo for a team to stream which should be interesting 🧐 much harder track but much shorter distance as I was kind of ok till around the 17 hour mark when I became a bit of a zombie 🧟‍♂️ 😂"
Yeah but even he probably took time to poop
"There was a guy who won LeMans in the early thirties or something like that. Forget his name sadly. 

He drove 23 1/2 hours. The half hour break he took, he used it for a bathroom and tea break. While his son took the car around for two laps.

Pierre Levegh attempted this is 1952. He was leading with a hour or so left and his engine let go.

EDIT: His name was Louis Rosier, he won the 1950 race with his son Louis Jr, who indeed only drove 2 laps. Minus the 2 laps by his son and mechanical hiccups, he drove 23 hours 10 minutes overall."
I think there was a race won by a dad/son pairing irl where dad drove for 23h 45min. But can not recall what year that was
"Bathurst hella hard!! 

12 hours looking back now not to bad 😉 

17 hours plus is where it really gets grim."
That might have been it. I knew it was an endurance race he got DQed for doing solo
"To be honest I think it's way easier to stay awake on the ring since there's always something happening and every lap is so long that you don't get bored of it. I would've fallen asleep on Daytona for sure haha. 
Congrats and hope you join another 24h solo driver with PSM ;)"
"Don't back down, the Ghost GT3 will live on"
"This is the way.

Now create the Imodium Sim Racing team and drop me a message, i want to be part of it 😂 we even drive the same car."
"Frankly, I think 2 drivers is already insane and probably should not be allowed for the exact same reasons as soloing.


But I guess the upside is that you were already preparing for long stints and not enough sleep."
"They have to do whatever minimum drive time is, based on total team laps divided by the number of drivers, divided by 4.

 For example, a team of 4 that completes 400 laps total would need to complete a minimum of 25 laps each."
😂😂😂 I used my 48 second pit window very efficiently!!

I can confirm I have sent the email….now just to wait for the reply
As a driver from this split amd watching him do it. GIVE THIS MAN HIS WIN
You don't like rooting for the underdog do you?
"I shared your story with my team, applause all around 😉"
Ollie gave you high praise in today's stream around the 3hr 37 min mark https://www.youtube.com/live/EqSbz9U3b14?si=_dnD_t9ay_3OUuZ4
Accepted 👍 thanks very much!
I would protest and protest more until they gave it back. A win is a win and you were at a disadvantage. It's like winning an indy car race in a go kart and then them disqualifying you
"What case? He's required to have 2 people drive. There's nothing to argue. 

Results say he was 21st. 21st is not a win."
Well he did cheat since he didn't follow the rules. Kind of the definition of cheating.
"Keep that screenshot forever and plaster that at the top of your team application if you ever go for a more organized team. I'm sure you have a million offers but if you just want to meet some friends who happen to get together for all the enduros when able drop me a DM. Endurance racing is love. Endurance racing is life.

Congratulations good sir/ma'am. I salute thee 🫡"
Fuckin A brother.
"Yeah, I usually get an adrenaline spike in those sort of situations, big issue for me is that adrenaline physically makes my legs start shaking, not at all what you want when you're trying to keep the foot firm on the accelerator!"
Very true. I just knew that sacrifices needed to be made and if your doing something insane go all out. A longer toilet stop and the win would have been flushed down the loo 😂
"If this is the story I’m thinking of, he let his son drive two laps while he ate lunch and used the restroom

If anyone is curious, [this is the story I was thinking of.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcars/s/fUaawLfeuY) looks like he did 23.5 hours which isn’t solo but it’s close."
"2 drives would have been just as nuts in honesty and maybe it’s only challenge as you would be stopping and starting driving as once I started I just kept going and got in a rhythm. 

I was very ready for no sleep and had so much caffeine I probably could have powered the computer with my energy levels 😂"
"I saw in GTP qualifying that this is the final year that the real-life race will allow a team to field only three drivers, next year four will be required. The Action Express GTP is the only prototype with three drivers."
So not a pitstop but a shitstop?
I will have to have a go at clipping it. Will have so much footage and many code brown moments!

Pretty sure the 2.1k driver isn't an underdog in a 1.5k split.
Thanks!! I hope you and your team had a great time as well!!
Holy shit! Oli says I’m a King 👑 Cherry on the cake!!!thanks for sharing this!!!
Disadvantage on rest. But big advantage on IR.
the results clearly say he had the fastest race time 💁🏼‍♂️ 21st or not that’s a win in pretty much everybody but you’s book. It’s a bull shit rule that has no reason to be enforced here. For about 30 seconds there he was on top of the world as he should be.

What advantage did /u/rhilXD gain exactly?  Him racing non-stop is an advantage? This is an advantage against teams racing in 2-hour stints? 

We can say he broke the rules, sure. Technically he broke the rules and that's why iRacing doesn't count him as the winner. We all understand that. But rule braking does not equate to cheating, and we as humans *with ability to rationalize* can look beyond the black and white rules. We can look at this situation and see that, for all intents and purposes, he won the race. 

I'm not sure why you need to be pedantic ^(*read: a prick*) about this. It's an outstanding achievement. Just treat it as such."
"I really will do!
I’m going to be adding it onto my CV so future employers knows what a madlad I am!

Thanks very much for the offer, I may well reach out in the days to come. I turned my pc on this morning and looking at it hurt my eyes something awful so may need a couple of recovery days first 😅

Thanks very much
And yes! Endurance is love, endurance is life. 
It’s the full adventure book with so many chapters and twists and turns. You couldn’t write it!"
"I know exactly what you mean!! I was literally saying to myself it’s a long race continuously to try and calm myself down and trying to do long breathing. But the adrenaline and the caffeine ect were making me shaky. 

My mentality shift of late has been to do P10 racing. Anything above that is epic which helps to take the pressure off when your in 4th and you get passed rather than go shit now I’m 5th I would say I’m still lots of places above 10th to try and calm myself and try and have less desperation to hold onto a place at any cost, as not every race/place is winnable and not eveyone you race with is clean and respectful. Some people it’s better to surrender the place and live to fight another day and sometimes they then take themselves or another person ahead out which could have been me if I fought with them"
So you peed in a bottle while on the sim? Lmao congrats on the goal

Then it’s not truly solo unfortunately
"According to everything I can find he definitely did it solo, officially he did have a nominated co driver but he never got into the car.

He finished 8th, 20 laps down in a 14 year old Bentley"
OP's got a [shitbucket](https://youtu.be/i5HDQWrmVq0?t=109).
"Would love to see clips. I was in the 774, awesome race."
"
*
This split was higher than 1.5k. It was a 1933 SOF. I've been on iracing 11 years and this was the cleanest race I've been in."
![gif](giphy|Cz6TlrRVVyv9S)
See you in July for the next basic 24hr. I think you get a golden ticket lol
"Everyone except me and iracing.  They're kind of the ones who make the rules.

Also he was a 2.1k driver in a 1.5k split."
"The advantage was that his presumably much slower 1k teammate never had to turn a lap. Even if he had run the minimum 3 hours losing only a second a lap it wouldn't have been a win. 

I mean what's next?. Having an 8k driver team up with seven 0.5k drivers and having the 8k driver do the entire race in a 2k split? Big win right?

Originally I was merely pointing out that it wasn't a win. Because it's not. He crossed the finish line first. It's impressive that he drove 24 hours. BUT IT'S LITERALLY NOT A WIN BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RULES! But you all are just determined to call this something it's not and targeting me for simply pointing out the obvious. It's baffling. 

If you don't like the rules then petition to have them changed. But don't just break them and say ""well he won even though he didn't."" Why can't you all just accept that?

Again, for those who still don't understand: I think it's it's an impressive achievement. But it's not and never will be a win."
Nahhh ain’t no pee bottles going near the rig. You’ve got 48 seconds for a pit stop. Run to the loo quick time. I was very slowly sipping water through the race but when I knew it was gona be toilet pit stop I would drink extra water so that I was bursting and could we straight away….no time to waste 😅
"You have a point. But I believe that’s the closest it’s gotten unless someone has another story

Edit: guy below me has the correct story it seems."
"Interesting. I was told the story as he took a break, but maybe that was one he did before, or maybe a different person entirely. Thanks for sharing!"
I’m gona have to try my hand at video editing as I have the reply saved!
I would love it if I was able to take part!
And he still placed higher than you or anybody in that split after 24 hours straight of racing. Guess we found the one guy who crashed out in both of his splits
You are insane and we love you
"48 seconds for a loo break... this is no challenge for old men, it seems."
For a laugh google stadium pal
My question is did you wash the hands in the 48 seconds or did you skip that for the 24 hours?
So most of those incident points were because you didn’t wash your hands. You really have to drive safer in the post Covid world.
"I do video editting for Esport events (mainly Rocket League) If you have any way of uploading the replay anywhere, I'd be keen to go through it in my spare time and find some cool moments. I'll just sift through abnormal lap times to start and if you have particular moments noted down, I can have a look at them too!"
Could you send me the replay file from iracing please. I had to close out of sim like 3 or 4 times due to it bugging out. Every time I tried to save iracing said replay file Could not save.
Deffo won’t be winning that as I’m consistent but not that fast at all!
Wow so angry. We actually scored 7th--while following the rules.
"Reading this post, while on a 5min toilet break"
Ooooo that could save some time and stress……..I mean *cough cough* who would get one of those for racing 😅
"😅😅😅 negative ghost rider. 

I was wearing gloves while in the rig if that makes it any better 😅"
"I will look into how to get the recording available as it would be amazing to get a highlights video out of it!

Will have to sift through my abnormal laps to get going. Might get some scary flashbacks. At one point I did an over take, thought I was passed them….turns out I wasn’t, did a double spin on the straight and some how caught it before the wall! As well as many more code brown moments!"
"Hell yes, of course I can…..if you tell me how to send the file over 😇😂

I haven’t watched the reply back to double check it’s worked. It it said file saved as normal

Sorry your one bugged out!"
On the ring consistency is 👑! 🤣
I think you’re just missing the point and lack the ability to be happy or impressed by anybody but yourself. Go back to your dark hole in the wall you call a room
Sebring at sunset. Blind him. 😅
"Maybe start with Lime Rock, it's like 5 turns to the right and 1 to the left. It's easy to remember and short, so you can do quite a lot of laps in a short amount of time. I've noticed with friends that they loose interest fast when they crash every 5 corners, because they can't remember the track layout.

After that, some new track like Zandvoort or Mugello for the full experience."
"Maybe one of the new or recently updated tracks that’s has better graphics, like Okayama, Zandvoort, and Mugello."
"Rudskogen is very pretty, nice trees and cliffs"
"Mount Panorama at sunrise? The view from the top of the mountain is pretty spectacular.

Very tricky track for a beginner though."
"Road Atlanta. I’m biased cause it’s my home track.

It’s fairly short, has a great mix of corners and elevation change, the esses are fast and can be scary especially in VR."
"I'm a big fan on the nurburgring but it's a tricky track has you know, any gt3 gt4 track should be nicely. I've seen mount panorama up here and imo it's a very challenging track but I'm racing in the lmp3 car sa I have no idea how the gt3s handle on there but very pretty map nontheless"
"Road Atlanta, Donnington, Nordschleife at sunrise or sunset should work"
U can sell ur rig and demo any real track in the world with a track day on rent gt3 car.
Motorland Aragon at sunrise was really nice during Week 3. Especially around turn 13 when the sun rise bloom was blinding for just a second or two. I really enjoyed the flow of the track as well
Okayama hands down.
Sebring definitely.
Sebring just before sunrise/at sunrise
ViR
sebring in teh porsche.  or the corvette gt1
But the track itself is shit. Feels more suitable for karting than gt3.
"Not mount panorama, man. He will be towing more than driving. I would go for a small easier track that has been recently updated. Knockhill should be easy to learn, all corners are quite unique."
"Maybe it’s just me, but this is the one track the highlight the dated iracing graphics. I mostly don’t mind it, but there’s something in this track  specific that makes it stand out to me."
Ok 🙄
"OP wanted something to show off his setup. Knockhill is a great circuit, but not the most picturesque. 

Most memorable (for me at least) because the Knockhill loading screen in Project Cars 2 is a massive pile of old tyres."
I finally got it the other day and I agree with you. There’s so much open space and poorly textured grass you get to see when you’re not on the mountain.
"Went from A1.66 murder SR at Daytona to A4.99 in 2 races of 0x last week in this, was great fun as well! Onto IMSA this week and the 2:40hr at the weekend! 😬"
"I fucking love the IR18 wish more people would drive it, ages ago when I was ranking up in C class I managed to get into a 10+ person barber session and it was bliss. At the time I didn’t realise how rare that was for my Timezone."
"I got to A license doing a nords race. Kinda wish I hadn’t. There’s no A class racing I’m currently interested in so I’m mostly just dealing with a more fragile SR! 😂

Nothing like having your SR go down because of a 3x and the guy behind you gets 6x and it goes up 😂😂"
"Lmao yeah that's true. Though imsa is at nords this week for GT3 so it's actually pretty great I got A tonight. 
But yeah that's also true. Just gotta try and be safe, all you can do"
"Eh. I’m not too worried about it. I generally don’t have an issue with incidents. Just the occasional netcode or dingus from behind kind of thing. 

Worst thing that’ll happen is a demotion to B class. Which won’t change anything for me 🤷🏻‍♂️. I’m not currently interested in racing IMSA or F1 and those are the only things an A class license opens up for you."
"Afaik the game runs on DirectX 11, for it to be compatible with RTX Remix it has to use DirectX 8 or 9 with a fixed function pipeline, also it has to not use a shader-based API for rendering.

If you really wanna ask the experts though, [go here](https://discord.gg/rtxremix)."
Ah. Doesn't sound positive!
Looked like you saw someone grilling brats and stopped off for one real quick.
"To whoever took this escape last year and shared the clip here, THANK YOU.

My rear stepped out and I was sliding right at the edge of that barrier. Having seen that clip gave me the confidence to smash the throttle and go all-in to avoid totalling the car."
I was hoping to see debris and bodies as you drove thru the RV lot. 😂
"WOW that works? :D  
Did you get an offtrack for this?"
"This exact same thing happened to me, i got a 46 second penalty"
Holy shit you made it back?? I got spun into that area last season and got lost in the campers and couldn't find my way back in lmao.. maybe a different spot
Did that during the IMSA endurance race last season. Stopped right in front of the bathroom. When you gotta go….
Wonder if that's ever happened in real life. I've also wondered if a car has ever lost control on the straight and spun into the pit lane
"LOL thats hilarious, I was able to do that in a practice sesh one time and saw all the spectator camping areas"
Had to grab a beer
Wow. Actually going to practice this
Happens to the best of us really.
"Well it is a 24 hour race, gotta stop for chow and a deuce every now and then."
maybe we can reenact this once GTA VI drops
Black flag and 46 second stop and go
If you go back through the same hole I think you just get an off track unless they changed it
Same. If you uncheck all boxes before pit stop it will drop it to 15 secs.
"Pretty sure these roads are fenced off IRL (and I think fenced off but without collision on the fences on iRacing) so you couldn't do this in real life.

As for the pit lane not sure IMSA's rules about it but it happens so often in NASCAR that they actually have a rule on the books that they won't penalize you for wrecking into the pit lane or using it as an escape road to avoid an accident as long as you make every effort to get down below pit lane speed limit once back under control."
"that´s hard.  
Propably better than 15 Mins fixing the car"
"Yeah it is but honestly it should be like a drive through, because if you cut straight on to the oval you get the same penalty and dont lose much time in comparison"
"I think this experiment would've massively benefitted from using a track that is in the sim and/or giving the drivers much more time. 

This unfamiliar track in a 200k car for such short drivetime. It's still an experience i'd kill for. But it's going to affect the results as the fear of crashing is very real."
"Some of the timid laps were not a reflection of skill, you get a few laps in a race car on an unfamiliar track you can’t expect to be out there without a care."
3 warmup laps in a 200k car on a track youve never done then timed….what
Next video can we see sim racers on tracks they know please?
"Even on a familiar track a sim racer is going to have much more fear of crashing than a real life racer. That just takes experience to overcome, there’s no getting around it. As far as skill is concerned I think it’s obvious that a good sim racer will be a good IRL racer. And there’s plenty of evidence of that already out there."
"Yeah the whole video is complete clickbait if you ask me. It's not fair to compare these drivers, at all."
"It's no fault because in real life it is no fault. 

Safety rating is iRacings version of money. That is how it should be viewed. Doesn't matter who caused what, if you got a 4x worth of damage, you're fronting the repair bill. 

The SR system is designed for you to have a bad race now and then, just like how you have a crash budget irl. But a trend of bad races will reduce your license and now you have to race cheaper cars because you can't afford the big things. 

If you're getting in so many crashes that you're about to lose your license, even if a rulebook says none of it is your fault, that's still a reflection of your driving. 

You can protest an unsafe rejoin by the way, it's halfway to being an intentional wreck which makes it against the rules. That's how you give them the extra fault you seek. But they can't un-crash your car."
"I've seen accidents where someone has been punted off track hard enough that they've then re-entered the track at another location without actually getting control of the car in the meantime. Sure, it would be nice if the car that got collected after the ""re-join"" didn't get any incident points for that, but the car that sent them off-track in the first place should absolutely get 4x for the resultant heavy contact.

If you see someone doing shitty re-joins or other reckless driving then protest them."
"I think there probably could be some other systems. 

Personally I wouldn’t change anything about incident points. Safety rating is a measure of how often you’re involved in an incident. Some people are at fault a lot, some people are rarely at fault, and still others just straight up don’t get wrecked. There is some merit to incentivizing avoiding incidents even if they wouldn’t be your fault. 

However I would like to see a penalty system. Like getting black flagged for an unsafe rejoin, for example. But I’m not sure a system like that would be very feasible and wouldn’t be subject to abuse or false penalties. It’s fun to think about I guess but I have yet to hear a real proposal that is genuinely better than what we have now. 

Shifting some responsibility on all drivers is, ultimately, a really good thing."
"You already gave a reason why it wouldn't work for an extremely simple case. Every single time someone rejoined the cars nearby would just nudge it back off the track or into the wall, knowing that they'd be forcing the other driver to get a penalty. You'd then have to consider how long after the rejoin the penalty could be gotten, speed differential, what counts as a rejoin Vs just going off track a bit, the detail involved would be a lot to cover all cases, and that's just for rejoins. The same applies to brake checks, rear ends, side swipes, and then for all those how do you handle the logic when more than two cars are involved? Simply put, the effort required would be massive for basically no benefit."
6x for causing a meatball on another car.
"That is an excellent way to look at it.

Still doesn't take the sting out of it when you get hit by someone completely out of control with probably all 4 tires off the ground.

Or worse yet is you get a 4x from a car that doesn't exist. (Car was heavily blinking and was disappearing and reappearing all over the place as they tried to regain control of the car and rejoin in the most unsafe manner possible. They were off track on my left, disappeared, then reappeared directly in front of me completely sideways, I didn't even have time to react before they were gone again. I got a 4x and my car had no reaction or damage to any kind of impact.)"
"This is obviously not the case since you get incident points for off tracks, spinning and other infractions that do not cause any damage and would not cost money in real life. In real life there is fault since this is not just a simulation of damage."
"They do. 

If you hit someone (0x) and then they go off track or spin or hit someone else, you also get a 1x/2x/4x as you're deemed to be ""part"" of the sequence of events. 

Doesn't happen often, but the mechanism exists. "
"These are all good points. It's also important to consider that the current system also bakes in the fact that many incident points are received by innocent parties. If we had some at fault 4x, then the math behind the SR could be adjusted to reflect this. Also, even without the incident points, the innocent party still has every incentive to avoid contact since it will ruin their race."
"Time to begin training GPT or any AI to take care of the penalty system? I don't believe it would do it worse than FIA stewards at F1. If we set them as a standard, even a random penalty to any car involved in an incident would be good enough."
"> off tracks, spinning and other infractions that do not cause any damage and would not cost money in real life.

Spinning wrecks the tyres, offtracks can ruin the splitters, shake the car up vioently, and also ruin the tyres. What do you mean its free?"
"I may have worded my post awkwardly; I know that the current system works that way. I was saying that under the system proposed by the OP that the punting driver may not get the 4x when the punted car comes back on track and cleans someone up because the ""at-fault"" system thinks the punted driver is rejoining the track and is therefore solely responsible for anything that happens afterwards, completely ignoring that someone else kicked off the entire debacle."
Nothing in real racing is free and you can damage the car by just driving around the circuit. The idea that someone getting a 1x (because they went a few inches outside of the line) is justified because it simulates damage is silly.
"Take your car to a track day. 

In the first session, keep it clean, take a note of the wear and tear on the car. 

In the second session, throw it sideways into the grass. You'll notice how not only has the wear and tear amounts increased, but considerably so. You'll be going into ""costs I didn't want to pay"" territory. 

And yes, even going a little off the track is going to scratch up your paint at a minimum with all the lumps of old rubber attacking it or grass painting it green."
"Not necessarily and even if that were the case, it does not cause as 25% of the damage as someone going airborne because someone rammed into them. I agree with with that simulating damage is part of it but its clearly not the only reason for the SR."
"SR can also represent your reputation according to the rumour mill. Do you want to be racing against people that can't keep their car on the track and pointed in the right direction, or always seem to be caught up in accidents?

Sure, a lot of the time off-tracks don't cause any damage, but all it takes is a one slightly wrong input at just the wrong time with half the car off track and there's car parts everywhere."
"I'm telling you rn as somebody who raced for nearly a decade professionally, off tracks cause a lot headache and time and will cause damage (that isn't simulated by any racing sim) about 9/10 and if you go off track repeatedly it will eat into your budget just like one big crash would."
Congrats... Next track is Bristol which I'll probably avoid due to the carnage that awaits. I finally dug outta the SR and iRating hole doing Gen 4 at Talladega. I won a couple races there this week. Did you qualify and stay up front or lay back? I don't even qualify there just to try to survive the first few cautions.
Congrats!!
Short track racing is my strong point and I’m in A class oval finally
"I think I'm a few safety rating points from getting promoted to B. I was 3.88 but I thought I'd try Draft Masters an hour ago just to run 20 laps and stay clean 🤣 Wow, that obviously didn't work out after a giant wreck in lap one. I ended up losing both ratings just because I'm an idiot and should've avoided Draft Masters."
"Btw, I love Bristol but I'm only meh there. I'll probably practice against the AI, then ghost race with Gen 4 to gauge my lap times against real drivers. Good luck there this week."
"After ghost racing with the Gen 4 series at Bristol, a few things come to mind. There are way too many drivers who need to practice before trying Bristol. There were at least 10 cautions at my ""split"" and the same for the other splits. Also I need to work on my line on entrance & throttle control on exit. It's so easy to get loose there... duh."
At least warm up the tyres
Which car?
"Any of them, I'm struggling with them all at the start"
"All of the low horsepower cars you should be able to just floor it when it goes green, especially if you're not in the slick. 

The high horsepower cars, you'll have to be a little careful on the throttle to avoid wheel spin"
"Okay, I'll keep trying that, I'm sure I'll find the sweet spot eventually... right? Haha"
"I think copying the 'rendererDX11OpenXR.ini' to the 'rendererDX11.ini' should do the job if i recall correctly.  
Make a copy of the original files beforehand"
"
Start with Ray 1600 Rookie, then Ray 1600 Trophy 

Don’t rush to choose between fixed wings or GTs

They Ray is the best of both worlds. Mechanical grip depended like a GT but you have to be careful as it’s an open wheeler. You can’t drive like a thug.

People underestimate how good this car, you will get so much out of it and Ray Trophy is by far the sim best racing I’ve encountered, anywhere. 

90% of the drivers are respectful and aren’t a bunch of wannabe next ‘Next Max Verstappens’ like some other classes. 

The dirty hotlappers also seem to give it a miss. 

Best of all the car is free and are the tracks in the Rookie series. Trophy a lot of free tracks as well. This season it has been at Tsukuba and Phoenix legacy. I think at least half the tracks are free. 

After you’ve mastered that class then decide."
"If you like both equally, I’d go with open wheel. I’ve heard Ross Bentley of Speed Secrets fame say you learn more with open wheelers and it can all be applied to tin tops later. Having taken that path myself, I’d probably agree."
"It really comes down to which you like more. 

I love open wheel cars so that’s what I do. Other people hate them. Luckily; there’s free options for both. 

My advice is spend a good solid amount of time in the FF1600 and the MX-5. Those are free and each will give you a vague approximation of what racing in open wheelers and GT cars, respectively, will feel like. My guess is after a few races in each you’ll feel drawn towards one more than the other. 

There are way too many factors that go into which series. 

For open wheel, I happen to be a huge fan of the USF1000 and PM18 series. They are D and C class respectively and have much cleaner racing than other open wheel classes. They also tend to mostly race on shorter, tighter tracks which, IMHO, are far more suited for those cars than the big tracks like Spa or Monza."
"I'd say just buy the top X road tracks and just pop for one GT car and whatever open wheeler you're wanting. The most popular tracks frequently get used between GT and open wheel, so the incremental cost is only the cost of one more car, as long as you don't mind switching back and forth depending about what series you own the track for that week."
"Just try the cars out in Assetto corsa or rf2 and find out which you enjoy more, and then commit to buying them in iRacing."
"You didn't really frame a question there.

My advice is to appeal to what you like. Driving a down force car is a different challenge to driving a heavy GT car.

If you love the F3 and hate the mx5, choose open wheel and vice versa.

I alternate - generally I'm better in GT and worse in down force but I very much appreciate the challenge.  I will say graduating to the SF (eventually) means driving one of the most delightful cars on the service.

In the end, figure out what you enjoy and follow the thread."
"if you only want to do sprint races, i'd say go open wheel, maybe buy a single gt3 car or someething to give it a shot once in a while.  


if you're interested in doing endurance things once in a while i'd say go gt's or prototypes"
"They are so totally different to drive that it's very difficult to be competitive in both, so it's good you want to focus on one. What I would say, is don't feel that you need to race every paid track, every week. I've been down that hole - gotta get the race participation credit at the end of the season. But that $10 isn't worth the stress of getting a race in, across both series for a given car, every week. Some weeks you are too tired, ill, busy, and it just makes it feel a bit like work. There'll be weeks where you bought a track at the start of the season, it's come up, and you are in bed with the flu.

All that to say, pick a series, buy the tracks you love, try to race them. If you are enjoying it, buy some more later in the season. If tracks come up that you don't own, or don't love, go back and do some Rookie Vee or FF1600 for a week. Don't feel you need to buy and race everything. It'll cost you less, and it will probably be more enjoyable. Oh, and each season most of the tracks change, so you can end up buying a track that you will race once per year. Hence the comments from others on buying top tracks that come up all the time.

I'll end this comment with this, I own the PCup, a GT4, the F3, and a couple of GT3s, and some prototypes. I've raced all of them over the past year. I enjoy the GT4 the most (maybe because it's my most recent purchase). GT3 is great, but people are fast there. The F3 I enjoy, but it's bottom of the list."
Whether**
GT
Or split the difference and go with prototypes.
"My favourite series are F4, GT4, Porsche Cup and FF1600 so I feel your pain! I swap week to week but try not to change within the same week. 
Personally I find Formula way more fun and a lot more depth to the driving skill. 
Unfortunately good close racing is in GT cars."
"I started off in the mx5 way back when.. then moved to gt4/gt3. Still love myself the Mazda though and will jump into production car challenge races. 

It's all ypur preference tbh, I prefer gt or sportscaster over open wheel."
Downtime is today.  You can test all the cars you want.
">Ray Trophy is by far the sim best racing I’ve encountered, anywhere

Same experience here. I couldn't believe how the racing could be so close and competitive, and still be the cleanest racing I've ever had on iRacing (or anywhere else for that matter).

Someone on here told me that it's possible to race the rookie and Trophy back to back so you don't have to wait between races. If you switch back to the UI after qualifying in the Trophy, forfeit the session, and then enter the next rookie race, you will be able to join the rookie session just in time for qualifying. N.B. forfeiting the current session from the UI doesn't actually forfeit it - you can still finish it, and the results are counted.

I've not tried it myself yet, but I'm planning to next week."
"Plus 1 for the US Open Wheel series. Really fun, clean racing in each for the most part. Came into iracing expecting to run just formula cars, ended up falling in love with indycars and IMSA prototypes."
"Good advice - but caveat with the MX5 feels nothing like any GT cars. The GR86 is closer, but there's nothing until D class GT4 that feels like a GT car, really. Even then, GT3 have way more grip than GT4, leading to higher pace through corners and just a different drive. GT4 is a great balance for novices hoping to be competitive."
"Came for the Formula Car, stayed for Indy. Excited they are back and going to watch Undy Car Racing now"
I'd be into Indy if they ran more in Europe time. And had two or three splits - I'm never going to be quick enough for top split competition - learned that in TCR where there's often one split.
"Well the same is true for the FF1600 compared to high downforce open wheelers. 

But like I said; it’s a vague approximation. It’ll give you a bit of the “feel” and experience. At least; as long as you can with the free base content."
"Theres a 15 min fixed setup race that follows the 7 road 5 oval series starting next season, thatll probably go official a lot more often"
"Totally planned 360 drift into the corner that only pros drifters can do.

Nicely done!"
"To be fair, it wasn’t planned. I went from the baseline setup to Ringmeister fixed setup and I had to find out to eventually need to lift a bit. But yeah, once I started drifting it was more or less controlled 🙃"
The irony of complaining about people not braking appropriately; by using an entire paragraph that doesn’t have a single period in it.
"They don't realize the faster they go the sooner they have to brake (like when in the draft), they don't understand cold tires, they don't understand cold brakes, they don't understand that if you're behind someone you can't brake at the same point you normally would, etc."
Why can't people drive lol
"Yep, most drivers don't know how to follow closely. They follow the same breaking points in an empty track as they do when they are 0.2 seconds behind a car. 90% of my incidents are someone running into the back of me breaking into a turn and most of those are when I myself am following somone else closely and I get rear ended."
Too many People drive hard since there is no real repercussion on themselves witch means that you reset and forget. In my opinion there's a lot of faster drivers than me and I don't hesitate to let them by if they have the pace for it but most of the time they crash by themselves so you end up with +Sr and +ir with the position you were in
"Yes, it annoying to get murdered by hards especially on the first couple of corners or laps. 
Unless you are at high Irating, you will continue to encounter people who don’t know their equipment well, are unfamiliar with their chosen car and are trying too hard. You can’t make them better, but you can watch for them and avoid them - this makes you better.
If you are trying to get the irating up, keep in mind that mostly speaking, passing the erratic guy won’t give you that many more irating points,
and if he gets pissed and wrecks you, you will lose SR and IR. Pressure then and let the wreck themselves, especially when you are in the lower splits."

OP probably in bottom split ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
This is a huge problem in any car with downforce. They don't understand that these cars also use the downforce for braking. So they get super close to you and brake where the racing line tells them..... Except that's not right because now your braking distance has increased because you have less downforce from being behind a car. Aaaannddd we've pushed someone off track
"I've been in the PCUP exclusively this season. Coming out of Road America I've found imola way easier to lock up on, especially with a full load of fuel. If I forget to push my BB forward at the beginning of a race I lock up more and often slide out. If I do remember to change my BB before the race and pull it back as fuel burns off then I'm all good.


This PCUP season has shown some circuits to just be really tough in the car and imola so far has shown a lot of people just haven't found balance in their cars yet. By the weekend I find it sorts itself out. 


Also if you can see a car drafting and have a worry about them defend but off the racing line. I'll usually take a mid track position or a wide position to cut back on, but allows them to lock up and not risk hitting me if I offer them the optimal line. If it's just lap one T1 issues then... Well that's PCUP problems. "
If you're trying to improve SR get the hell out of Porsche Cup.
"The trick is to not instantly slam the brakes when someone is right behind you

Start braking a moment early and build the pressure slowly, this gives the car behind you time to react and do the same without hitting you."
"It takes 2 to have an accident and if you're perpetually having them, I suggest you look inward."
Heh
Because they have ARCA brakes?
💗
"You missed a big part the true issue. These cars use downforce to brake, not just turn. You have less downforce in the slip stream so your braking distance increases"
Exactly! So frustrating
"I will never not be terrified when the car behind me misses their turn because they didn't think i'd brake for the corner, so they panic, brake harder, which triggers abs or a lock, reducing their brake power."
"And then they’ll scream at you for “braking too early” because they don’t know what a slipstream is and think they were just magically faster than you. 

OR— scream at you to get out of the way because, again, they’re catching you with the slipstream and somehow think that means you’re in the way and need to yield."
"> there is no real repercussion on themselves 


This is why everyone needs a high torque DD base. Hitting someone should break at least one wrist. "
"The problem is that if you don't pass the erratic guy in front, then the guy behind will catch up and rear end you into a turn. I don't mind the no fault system that much but there is enough data to be able to determine fault in some situations."
I wish Reddit could interface with Iracing so you’re IR and SR automatically show.
Nu uh split 2
Lol I'm frequently in bottom split and this isn't enough of an issue to for me to complain about it.
This is the correct advice. I lost 25% of my iR and 40% of my SR in a single week of the Porsche Cup.
"This is true but you're completely disregarding his also true point. Morons don't understand these cars use downforce to brake. Then they get in the slipstream with less downforce, decreasing your braking distance.  So then they slam into the back of you and blame you for it."
Oh I don't know about those cars specifically. I was just mentioning general truths.
"You can’t fix stupid. 
My view, channel your inner motorcyclist, assume everyone is out to kill you and use defensive driving as much as you can. Happy racing."
Gratz
It's all cars with downforce.
"That’s really good going. 
For some context, I hovered around the 1400 mark in rookies. Then dropped to 850 after leaving rookies. 
I’m now on the cusp of 1600 and I’ve been iracing on and off for 12 months

Haven’t got any tips on how to improve as you seem to be better than me already. I would say get some load cell pedals when you’re set that this hobby is for you. Much more consistent"
"IR is for matchmaking, if it raise you're stronger than your actual opponents.

SR will raise by itself if you're not a reckless driver, I had B license after 2 weeks of iracing, but I was still noob with low IR.

Don't focus on numbers, have fun!"
"It's nothing. This iRating is a tool for matchmaking. If you better you will rise it, if slower, you will lose it. Let's take random number, 2000 iRating. Let's say person have it driving FF1600 or Mazda MX5 and 2000 on Mazda not the same as 2000 on GT3 car, or GTP, or F3. Probably person will quickly learn new car, but definitely will loose his iRating in first few races, or even fee weeks or months (depending on how quickly he will learn new car). And this is working on opposite side. 
It's never mean someone who have 2000 is always better than someone with 1800 on iRacing in general. But mostly accurate if we talk about... ""Person with 2000 on (car name) mostly better racer than 1800 person on this same car"".

So, iRating is tool that trying to put your with people with similar skills as you, but can be wrong when you change a car and correctly working if you stay on one car. If you change a car, iRating will ""calibrate""."
"That is a very good IR for a rookie, means the best 30% of i-racers. Bear in mind that the classes tell how safe people are not how fast they are.
But if you are winning with 1600-1700 IR races you are doing well. Not sure how the competition is in F1600, you could have a harder time in other series.
You might want to check out F4 if you like open wheelers. GT4 and Ferrari fixed are good classes to progress to for tin top cars."
"if you want more competition do the ferrari challenge.    
I was at 2000iR after 2 months in rookies in ff1600, because the driver level isn’t as good as in other classes.    
When i started in GT3 i instantly dropped to 1800 iR and i have to practice way more than in ff1600."
Yh well atm im using a Logitech g920 I know it isn’t the best for sim racing but looking to improve when it gets to summer time.
Ty Yh makes sense tbh but the numbers make me want to be extra cautious and stuff
Yh I have bought the f4 and hungaroring had a little test drive yesterday but noticed how oversteering it is idk wether it could me overdriving it but yh. I’ll have a little go tonight in a race and see how far off the pace I am. Plus I’m guessing damage and crashes happen a lot in f4 seems as the are open wheel. I’m hoping to get to 2000 irating by the end of the week idk if this is realistic or not. Plus all the tracks and cars are so expensive
Yh I heard that they’re hard. I really like single seaters though. The driving style and elements of singles seaters just suit me. I would probably get into that once I’ve had enough of the increased contact in single seater races. Thanks for the reply
I used that up until I replaced the pedals for the Logitech g pros 3 weeks ago. So well over a year and it served me well. I still use the wheel
"Be patient, drive safe, respect other drivers.

Train your weekly car track combo, have fun.

All numbers will grow"
"That’s a big goal, 2k will almost be best 10% of everyone. Normally rookies drop in irating once they are out of it. But i feel like you must have quite some experience with other sims so you might have proper pace.
My advice is to not look at your irating too much in the beginning and just enjoy races and try to stay out of trouble to progress in classes.

For reference I am 2.5k which more often than not means top split in the Porsche Cup with 4-6 splits running."
Yh I have decent experience. I have around 200 hours on assetto corsa but it seems quite different. I’m still on a Logitech g920 but looking to upgrade them later down the line. Thanks for the reply
"The good news is that PROTO/GT is C-class. And if you think GT3s are fun to race, you haven’t tried the GT1 yet. PROTO/GT is one of the best multi class series on the service - you should really give it a go!"
I second this. GT1 is infinitely cooler than GT3’s.
Maybe in fiture :D for now I already spend some money on tracks and BMW M4 for 3h VRS endus and gt3 sprints
The HPD (LMP2 predecessor) is only $2.95 by the way. And this season the PROTO/GT calendar reads like an iRacing’s greatest tracks compilation so you may already have a few of the tracks. 😃
"Not the Porsche, rear engined car throwing yourself down the mountain is a hand full. Historically Audi and Merc do well at Bathurst."
Stable will be BMW or Merc. Ferrari is pretty tame too.
"My least favourite GT3 is the BMW. It just drives like a boat and I don't really like understeery cars.


After trying the Ferrari, McLaren and the Porsche last time GT3 ran Bathurst I ended up running the BMW all week included VRS endurance. 


Make of that what you will, but as someone who intently dislikes the BMW it felt very stable and easy to drive at Bathurst. "
"This post made me check myself really good lol.

My initial thought reading this was ""Do tests in each one then find which you prefer and drive that one, duh""

Then remembered that not everyone owns every GT3.

Then remembered how much I've spent in iRacing......

But to answer your question, the BMW M4 GT3 tends to be considered the easiest and most forgiving to drive of all the offerings."
Mercedes.
I want to try the Bathurst 1000 this fall but I’ve heard the Supercar is very difficult to drive.
"From a BoP standpoint we won't know until the week of the event. From a general car handling standpoint, the more stable, netural (oversteer vs understeer at corner entry) cars are the BMW and the Merc. I'd also say the Ferrari is decently neutral. If you need a car that has more initial ""bite"" and ""rotation"" then look at the Audi, Lambo, and Porsche though the Porsche has a tendency to really lose the rear end due to it being rear engine. 

It's honestly way too soon to tell imo what you should drive for the event. I think the best course of action is to race in one of the GT3 official series and find a car that really feels natural to you. Then use that car in the Bathurst 12H regardless of the BoP because the BoP doesn't matter unless you are in the top like 5 or so splits."
I found a team and we are going to run the Ferrari. Been running laps the last few nights and its fun. Handles better there than the LMP3 did last week
"So since not everyone owns every GT3 they should download them NOW and then next time the test servers open up, jump on and try to test as many as you can.

Merc i think is normally best at Bathurst, BMW prob easiest to drive but last year it was a bit too slow"
"It is difficult but it's an absolute blast once you get the hang of it. Massive amounts of power, difficult brakes and not great handling.

If you can drive that thing you can drive anything.

I did the Bathurst 1000 last year, was great."
That's what we call the money shift. Downshift at too high RPM and popped the motor.
"ooof.  


Code brown, code brown!!!!!"
"This happened to us except we were a GTP passing on the outside and a GT3 abruptly moved up and clipped us. Spun the same way, had 1:40 penalty for crossing the pit lane which sucked, but it could’ve been much worse."
That kinda looked Intentional
"I'm not blaming you.  But this is why you should try to put lapping cars to the inside. Just saying this is avoidable with good traffic management.

Edit: people downvoting accident avoidance explains a lot."
Wow that was very close! Lucky lol!
He was perfectly fine where he was. The GTP is a complete knob that should have adjusted himself appropriately leading into T1.
"The reason we did this was to stop them from diving while we're in  the middle of the corner and it literally worked for the entire race and  most of the GT3s did this during the race as well. All but a couple of GTPs got the grasp of what was happening and it actually led to the split being mostly clean. 

If we we're expecting them to get to turn 1 earlier than they did then we probably would've allowed them to but they weren't and we wanted to make it clear that we were taking the inside line. 

Also with a bit more looking outside the clip we figured that the GTP that hit us was, at that moment, worrying about where the other GTP was and not focusing on what was in front of him hence why I think he made a sudden left in the steering because they just weren't focusing on where they were. 

They had a clean race for the rest of it so it was just a lapse of concentration for one moment from the green car"
Not saying the GTP isn't at fault. But what good does fault do? You should be trying to avoid the incident whether you're in the right or not.
"There was no incident to avoid. GT3 was doing nothing wrong. He moves up - he now blocks the blue GTP and causes him to move into the green. Staying exactly where he is was the best course of action. The GT3 is actually offline to give way for the GTPs.

Maybe you should be giving adivce to the 1.5k GTP, about to lose his A license, making a dumbass move into the turn and not the GT3 holding his line just fine.

edit: responding and blocking me before I have a chance to see what other excuses you can come up with is weird."
"That's why it's called an incident. They happen even if you're doing nothing wrong. 

Just saying that staying on the inside and making the GTP go around the outside is inherently more dangerous than putting the GTP on the inside. That's my only point. You don't want to do it fine. I'm not blaming the gt3. But the fact is if he had been on the outside the GTP wouldn't have hit him."
"We retired after 14 hours due to irreparable wheel damage. Porsche GT3 spun in the bus stop and hit the barrier back wheels first. Wasn't a big hit at all.

Came up on the screen saying ""We can't fix it, you'll still have major wheel damage.""

After all required and optionals the car was super loose in the back end, kicking on the TC all the time like crazy. We decided to call it then."
"I’m not 100% certain on this but this weekend during our first attempt we had a hardware failure and someone lost their brakes. Huge impact into the tire barrier coming onto track at nascar turn 1. Crew chief came over and said only some of the damage was repairable, after all required and optional the steering wheel was still off center by a good margin and we retired the car due to it. I think you may have gotten lucky but it was also like 4am so maybe we made a mistake"
More damage can now be repaired back to 100 like body panels and wings. Other stuff can not be repaired back to 100% like it’s always been.
"There is still some unrepairable damage, but they have made significantly more things fixable. Aero damage is generally 100% fixable in most (all?) of the endurance cars. Suspension damage is definitely fully fixed a higher percentage of the time now too."
We had to retire due to major wheel damage that wasn't repaiable.  Then we got disqualified because one driver hadn't met their requirements yet... but wecoukdnt finish 🤣🤣  so someone who only did 32 laps of the race finished higher than us who did 17 hours 🤣🤣
"Yes. About a year ago they made changes so that most endurance cars could be mostly repaired (within reason), even if it took a long time. "
I think the only thing that can't get 100 percent now is the engine? I'm not sure. Also depends on the car.
"Interesting, thanks for your feedback! Sucks for your race though :("
"Definitely the steering can still be affected after all repairs, it happened to us in the 1200GMT race so we parked it and did the 1600GMT one instead (we crashed 15 minutes in because our setup was straight shit xD)"
"Oh that sucks, thanks for your input!"
"Makes sense, thanks!"
"okay! That would explain a lot, thanks!"
Wow that sucks haha! Sorry to hear that
Thanks but thats racing hey.   some times you win sometimes you lose
"Or do it the dirty way like me: no clutch mapped, rev up in N and upshift to 1st on green light! "
when you add your pedals choose use a clutch and calibrate your clutch then change settings to auto clutch (or auto blip etc)
Clutch is a must have for standing starts. If you don’t have the pedal map a button you can reach to be the clutch.
What do you mean the clutch does nothing with your setup? I use the paddles and I just use the clutch on my pedals for holding 1st.
This is pretty much what I have been doing so far. Usually I lose a couple of places which is why I was trying to find a better way.
"Today I learned that this is the dirty way, I’ve been doing this since I started LOL"
"Ahh, so simple when you know how. Thanks"
"I have a clutch, just didn't know how to get it to work as I didn't calibrate it as I knew I was going to be driving auto only and didn't need clutch or gears (or so I thought when I joined)."
"My clutch does nothing is what I mean. i.e. I press it and nothing happens.

But as macmanluke said above, this is because the clutch has never been calibrated whereas yours obviously has been."
"Yes I also lose some places but also sometimes gain some. I am always mid pack and don’t fight that much! But you are right this post is actually prompting me to try and improve, so I’ll map the clutch and try a proper start! See you at the start!"
"Yea got me as well, not sure why it does not let you set a clutch pedal when you choose auto clutch"
A good number of the road cars like the Mazda have a clutch but you don’t need to clutch to shift unless you want to down or up shift earlier than the rpm’s will let you
"Ah, yeah I could see not realising that if you didn't know it, glad you got it sorted!"
"Yeah, I shan't be using a clutch once I pull away after the lights going Green. I don't fancy buying a manual gearbox just yet either, I'd like to try and stop spending money like it's going out of fashion for a month or two, this stuff gets expensive."
"I race on a controller and mostly race nascar which is why I have a clutch button always mapped. Why spend hundreds or thousands on rigs when you can be competitive with a $60 controller.

All the money I’m saving allows me to buy more tracks and cars"
"Just an FYI, as the Mazda they use follows the real car, it actually has the sequential shifter so an H pattern wouldn't work with it regardless."
"This is most likely the release of the 2024 Camry and Mustang Dark Horse Next-Gens (which I've been waiting for - gotta get those paints ready for the new season!)

iRacing ""accidentally"" released the new templates on Friday - if you go to the Camry or Mustang in the UI paint shop and click ""download template"", you get the new one.

https://preview.redd.it/hh77nhf3n0ec1.png?width=2249&format=png&auto=webp&s=13d7d61f2dd8988b6d00fc2b841ea72c3c90909f

If you have a Toyota, you will have to make some changes to your paint (the rear quarter windows have moved, the hood area is elongated, the nose part is shorter; however, the roof/sides/decklid still line up.)"
"ok now the Daytona 24 is out of the way, make it rain!"
"Ok this makes me really happy
> [Legacy] Mazda MX-5 Cup & Roadster - 2010
This car, including both models (Cup and Roadster), is now FREE to all iRacing Members. This car is now part of the base content for iRacing, and has been added to all accounts."
"Have vehicle artwork updates been done in the past? I can't recall if they've left the performance alone and only modified the look of a car.

An artwork update would be great for the M4 GT4 car. Give me those big kidney grilles!"
So this just a body shell update for the existing content?
"Mustang is still the same template, only the camry has the new template in the paint booth"
"As someone who only does NIS and A class Cup, Ive been dying waiting to get the new Toyota. I have a few paints ready to go to transplant.  Lets go!"
"I wonder what the impetus for this was.  Are they doing something with the car?
Though I'm also confused, wasn't this free content before the ND version came out?"
I don't know whether it's an update to the existing Camry if you already have it (even though current paints won't completely work) or an all-new purchase.
"Unless they switched it back (I haven't looked since Saturday) - there was a Dark Horse Mustang template when you downloaded it.

It's not easily visible in this pic, but the license plate on the rear has a 2024 sticker.

https://preview.redd.it/cfx70vol91ec1.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&s=f734e4af30214fb4aa9b8bf394a9cc5f6bf84ee2

The Camaro also had the same modified date in the template pack (1/19), but I didn't see anything significantly changed on it."
"Surprisingly it wasn't, while I doubt iracing will personally be doing anything much with those, I'd always kinda wanted them for showing folks the sim with a free road car with an h pattern.  

The only way I see these getting raced in officials is if they put them in the series where the car changes every week, like Ringmeister or Weekly Challenge."
Most likely they'll erase the 2022 model and overwrite it with the 2024 model for free. That's what happened to Toyota Tundra.
"Now that's odd. I've had 2 people check today and both said the new camry is there but still old mustang. Not that I'm worried, I use the camaro, all I'm expecting (and hoping for) is updated stickers"
Can you somehow post this file? I know a lot of people who are getting the wrong file from iRacing
"What? It's been many years, but I'm pretty close to positive they were free content."
There are no changes for the Camaro for 2024 (besides maybe stickers) so all paints should be good.
"I think they were free if your account was old enough when they were official, but I can confirm as someone who never raced them, that they definitely were not."
"Oh yeah I saw someone else talking about that just now, I had no idea as an ""old timer"", the NC was my rookie car."
"Yes in the options there are settings for text chat and voice chat when you are in the car. It's not specifically for green flags though, it applies anytime you are in the car and not the replay screen."
"
You can also bind a button to mute so you so you can chat during yellows and mute during green."
"Come outside and join me on the lawn where we can yell at clouds at shake our fists at them.

I have no idea. I just turn everything off."
"Okay thanks, I'll look again. I knew I could turn off the spotter text but I never saw driver text chat."
"Yes, I need to bind a mute button to my button box or Stream Deck as well. Thanks."
"This is the way, love hearing the transition from friendly greetings to total carnage after few cautions!"
Okay but first I need to stop by Kmart to get me one of those uncomfortable 1970's aluminum frame & nylon strapped lawn chairs to sit in.
Can I join? These damn kids.
Bravo! 👏👏👏
That looks clean!
jj abrams approves
That amount of flare would impress even the manager of Chotskie's ...
beautiful!
Good shot brother
All of them seem to be glitched at the moment.  Even my old previous results have no words saying what it’s for
It's not all glitched goto your profile and then the awards it'll be better
you will benefit from either a CPU or GPU upgrade. Iracing frame time is a culmination of both render and graphics times. i suspect you will gain more from a gpu upgrade.  i know my 1080ti was starting to struggle when the 3000 series came out and moving to a 3080 was a big jump. that was on a 3700x so a similar cpu. i wouldnt spend any money on your existing motherboard/cpu unless it was the 5800x3d. the x3d models are a MASSIVE increase in VR performance over non-x3d models. it can be over 20-30% on cpu extensive tracks like long beach
"Yeah, I've been reading a lot about 5800x3d performance on VR, for now it's impossible for me to get one, but I would like to get one in the future.   


Looks like I'll get a 2060 then, hope it helps a little!  


Thanks for the comment!"
"I'm using a 5600x with 4070 and it's fine, don't worry about the X3D for 90hz, I get 90hz at Daytona night."
The intro was 1/3 the length of the clip....
Protest it and move on. Nothing more that can be done.
"bro, this is your content? ooooof."
"Well thats 30 sec ill never have back. An intro, for this? Really?"
Ok got it. Thanks for telling me to stop. /s
Google some breathing exercises
One car pulls off the track to logoff. The other car followed him off of the track and rams him. Which one should stop doing what?
"Generic intro, I guess I could have cut it out."
"Protesting doesn't give me back my SR.  I don't even think iRacing will do anything about this.   I see people stopping before the scoring stops, but rarely have I seen someone stop in the middle of the track while there is a car hot on their backside."
I would just wreck into a wall if you want a 4x that bad.  Why push your pursuit of a .99 SR on someone else?   It's just plain dumb to stop in the traffic line of an active race.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
"That is the issue, he did not pull off the track, he was right in the middle of the track.  I guess you don't run Legends at the Charlotte Short Track.  If you think he pulled off the track then you don't know what track it was.  You just made yourself look silly with your lame attempt to troll."
I’ve never ever watched a youtube video and thought it needed an intro like that. I appreciate when YouTubers don’t waste my time making me watch an engine rev for 10 seconds or whatever. Just my advice for your channel.
Making a terrible video about it and posting it here won't get your SR back either. Yet here we are.
"A single 4x is not going to significantly affect your SR. If you’re struggling to maintain SR, the issues go beyond the other knuckleheads. 

Protesting helps prevent it from happening to others."
"You're right, iRacing won't give back any SR lost. But if they're reported, they'll be sent an email detailing why the incident has occurred, why they are at fault, and how to avoid this issue in the future. If subsequent reports against this driver are sent in, then further diseplenary action will be taken."
I can get your SR back for $500
"I was not trolling. He looks like he is off the track in your video. He is well off to the side. He is off the black pavement across a yellow line into an area that has horizontal yellow lines. There is no further off the track he could go because there is a wall. I have never raced this track, but if I were, I would think that was off the track."
"No, he was in the race line, that is my frustration.  Most experienced guys pull off on the shoulder to keep from getting hit by traffic, they don't stop on the finish line while others are still approaching it. If you see the video, there is a car on the far inside who stopped, well out of the line of traffic."
Did you see dead people?
"They need to work on that the 12:00GMT start had 3.5k+IR GTP and GT3s and then sub 1k LMP2s, I get they fill the lobbys from the top but maybe when the irating disparity is that high they should put the lmp2s with a similar SOF"
"Same here. Session 2, split 4. We had a 300iR LMP2 driver and multiple under 1k. There were 12 of them and almost every crash in session had one involved. It was honestly astonishing. 60% of their field retired by hour 12."
"Is the LMp2 considered hard to drive ? I'm 1k4 and love it, but not too much participation indeed in IMSa and fixed LMp2"
I had an LMP2 in my race that was so unprepared that they were over 30 laps down from the lead LMP2 by like hour 6. After the race the first thing someone did was tell them to drive GT3 instead next year. They made a LOT of enemies in our split
*Time… to die.*
Which time slot?
There needs to be a DQ limit.  You cannot have teams rake up 400 incidents causing crash after crash after crash and just carry on.  It opens up for trolling as well.  There needs to be a DQ limit.
"Damn, my team was bottom split LMP2 for our time slot. Honestly a calm race, most of the large crashes in the first half are GTP on GT3 violence. 6 Lmp2s retired but mostly crashed themselves out or got murdered by back marker  GTPs sending hail marry's into the second horseshoe or bus stop. Otherwise it was a good race."
"Timeslot 1 split 4, we had 1.0k lmp2s, they were a danger all race. Bloody terrifying."
I noticed that the lower ones only had GT3 cars. Was this a license thing?
I really do love the LMP2 but I hadn't been able to do a special event in the GDP class so I was hell bent on doing so for this Daytona 24H. It's sad to see their participation drop so much but other than restricting what cars people can drive what can you do? I was in the low 20ish split range (no lmp2s) and I saw questionable GT3 and GTP driving (cars squeezing you up at the wall on the oval as you try to pass them like wtf!?). Maybe in the future iRacing could take a look at having iRating requirements for each class with GT3s having the least requirement (or none) and increasing those requirements as you step up to faster classes?
we lost bumber on black and purple caddy on split 16 and many momentst with lmp2.s
"We were close to the bottom split. top 5 were fine, the rest were wildly unpredictable and indecisive"
"We were in session 3, one up from the bottom split and we were all GT3s."
"I feel bad for those LMPs. I think I was in a GT4 but it may have been the Miata when I did a 4 hour NEC and the GT3s were at least twice my iRating. It was awful. I’d be trundling along and a group of what seemed like 15 cars nose to tail would blast by me and I’d almost have a code brown. Thinking about it, I must have been in the Miata because the speed disparity was crazy. It was like I was standing still compared to them. 

I hated it. I have no idea how I didn’t cause a wreck. "
Not people but I saw plenty of dead prototypes
"My split had 6k iR GT3s but 0.2k iR LMP2s.. yes, it was funny"
"Well tbh I much rather have a bad lmp2 grid in my split than none at all, being usually somewhere around in the upper quarter to third of the grids. Yes, it can be frustrating but part of endurance racing is dealing with drivers with lower skill level as well. I would be royally pissed being a mid tier guy and not getting all classes in my endurance grids tbh."
I was in this split as an lmp2 driver (my team actually won because we were the only team not to crash) while I do agree the lmp2 caused alot of issues this fact was brought up early on in the race in the chat and in my opinion alot of the higher rating gt3 and gtp drivers used low irating lmp2 driver as an excuse to send it into a corner when they shouldn't have or block on parts of the track you have no right to
"Yup we were in the same lobby, where'd you guys finish lol?"
"Same lobby. Actually were P2 in GTP for about 20hours until we got murdered by a GT3 4.1K who decided he didn’t want to stay on the racing line T5/T6.

Good race guys!"
I was in the same split! P2 in GTP
"Same split here, my only crash was lap 7, rear ended by a gtp while trying to avoid the two gtps crashing together in front of me.

Those LMP2 were slow, yes, but i had no contact with them. :D"
"No. If anything it's the easiest prototype to drive.  LMP3 requires a very careful braking technique or you will lock up and spin. And GTP is also easy to lock up in corners. 

P2 is even nerfed in power compared to because at full power (IRL as well) it's nearly as quick as GTP/DPi/LMH. "
"Nah the skill floor to be competent is pretty low, though like most cars that have a lot of downforce the skill *ceiling* is pretty high. Gotta drive it to find out though. One person’s east is someone else’s impossible. Like on ovals I find the wild Gen 4 car easier to drive quickly than the C Truck, but the C Truck is supposed to be the “easier” one."
"Its reputation is less about how hard it is to drive and who chooses to drive it. Less experienced, lower skill drivers like to jump into the faster car because *faster*, while more experienced drivers will drive GT3s because they're not enamored with a car being faster. 

Add in a lot of lower iRating drivers who tend to be lower iRating because they take it less seriously, and you end up with a car that's not necessarily difficult, just too difficult for the skill level."
I don't think its too hard to drive.
"We had one in ours that was literally 400 laps down and kept reconnecting and killing more people. Their laps were all over the place to the point i suspect they may have actually been wasted. 1:40 one lap, 1:50 the next. Killed multiple people deep into the race. Should never have taken part since they could barely do a clean lap."
12:00GMT Split 16
"Most likely popularity thing, a *lot* of people drive GT3s. Happened to me and my team last year at Sebring, 49 car GT3 field was wild"
"What time slot / split was that? We ran Friday 23:00 GMT, Split 2 and had these SOFs:

GTP: 2900
LMP2: 2400
GT3: 4300

Nothing bad happened, I think in 7.5 hours of driving I saw one crash involving more than a single car."
"endurance is dealing with traffic yes, but traffic isn’t driving vs ppl that can’t do 5 laps without crashing.

also, it’s a 24h race. no one wants to get murdered 10h in because the 0.2k forgot the track layout"
How to deal with drivers that just ram into you because they missed a corner completely? It's basically just gambling on survival with such low rated cars in a 24.
"I felt this way too until our 1.7k GTD split got paired with 0.9k GTPs (some as low as 0.2k). It was clear many of them had done little to no practice. Just about every GTD team got taken out by bad drivers in the faster class at least 2 or 3 times. Most of the GTPs would make scary passes in the kink (despite the gentleman's rule to not pass there). Some of them completed the race with almost 400x and less laps completed than back of the field GTD teams. We watched the same car crash in turn 6, pit for repairs, and repeat the same crash for 4 consecutive laps, I wish I was kidding/exaggerating. Really hope this doesn't happen to us again."
"easy to say this until you experience it. the skill disparity is way too high, some of those lmp2 drivers probably shouldn’t even be doing the 24hrs, let alone share the track with competent drivers."
P4 in the GTP class.
"We saw the replay, that porsche was all the race doing shit no matter which one was driving it."
Nice congrats. You guys were quick.
"We made contact with one of them. The funny thing was every time we came across him, he’d lock up or spin on his own. When we made contact the 1 time, he of course locked up ahead of us but rejoined really suddenly and hit our right side. Basically no damage but it made me laugh because I warned the current driver at the time that he would have an issue and less than 3 seconds later that happened."
"> No. If anything it's the easiest prototype to drive.

Honestly, as someone that drove the LMP2 a fuck load last year and the year before, I disagree. I think the Cadillac and the Porsche GTP are easier to drive in all aspects to the LMP2 (slow corners, mid speed corners, and high speed corners). They also are VERY driveable as TC is kicking in whereas if TC kicks in on the LMP2 it is VERY abrupt. Driving the Cadillac in the Daytona 24H was like skating on the slip angle with TC barely kicking in at all points within the infield."
"We where in 14... Even there, it was unbelievable how little race craft and car control one can have when having to go slightly offline/need to adjust braking die to traffic. Got a 7 mins repair due to one guy crossing right in front of us after spinning out in the turn back to the oval."
"This was Split 16, Timeslot 2 (Saturday, 13:00 German time for me), GTP was 3.5k SoF, LMP2 was 1.2k SoF and GT3 was 4K SoF iirc

I saw plenty of LMP2s not using the racing line, spinning constantly, locking and spinning, crashing people, taking the racing line with damage, swerving around, you name it"
Never heard of such a gentleman’s rule
">gentleman's rule

lmao, if passing there is a problem, then it's a you problem"
"Oh trust me, we did experience it. Multiple sub 1k p2's in our split. GTP had 3.2k and GT3 around 4.3k soft. It is what it is, and like I said, since immersion comes above everything for me in simracing I rather have a terrible p2 grid than non at all."
"Ahah no way, we were p3 and we crossed the line together"
"Yeah, not who we expected to take us out haha. Had fun nonetheless"
"We had two meatballs, one from a GTP rejoining on the racing line and another from an LMP2 literally stopping on the exit of T1 while me and 2 other cars where battling. Nowhere to go so I hit him.  


EDIT: Heres the stopping incident.  
[https://clips.twitch.tv/DiligentFancyMonkeyKevinTurtle-wt172wL6txH9B2ye](https://clips.twitch.tv/DiligentFancyMonkeyKevinTurtle-wt172wL6txH9B2ye)"
"We actually made it work without issue, but the GT3s run low downforce at Daytona so it tends to be a tricky spot for them to end up off line (especially so for the rear-engined Porsche). It's also just a terrible spot to make the pass since there's a braking zone immediately after and the prototypes are generally worse under braking than the GT3s. There was a pretty lengthy post about the ""gentleman's rule"" after last year's 24"

Oh nice haha. We were happy to get another Porsche up into the top 5 after we were in an almost all Caddy split. There were a couple BMWs and 1 Acura but I think they died early on.
"Oof, yeah we were in that split, that dude was a weapon crashing everywhere while they were 100+ laps down."
"I was interested to see what team had the most incidents over the course of the 24, and unsurprisingly it was the team with this chap in it at **346**.

This guy did 123 laps and accumulated 124 incident points, with a fastest lap of 1.39.228. Woefully, woefully underprepared. They were still running, but 162 laps down; the next placed LMP2 team were 73 laps down.

I get wanting to do this race as a team and doing it as a 3 is hard (I did it in GTP with 2 others; it's a slog), but this guy clearly did not have the skill to race safely around others. I know iRating is not the be all and end all, but his 3 teammates were 1150+, he is 352. Big shame, sorry this happened to you."
"Congrats guys, I was in the P7 Caddie (IBN Racing)"
Caddies just did so much better with fuel we found
"This was just one example as well. I saw LMP2s braking in the kink and take the bus stop in second gear and this isn't mentioning some of the moves on traffic they were making, just unreal stuff.  I really think iRacing need some kind of 107% rule or even a multiclass permit or just something. The thing is I don't even mind if guys are slow but a lot of these LMP2 drivers were \*bad\*, really bad and as you've mentioned just woefully underprepared. Also I appreciate the kind sentiment but its cool, we went into the race with no expectations and finished P11 after two meatballs."
Yeah there were a few teams making 29 laps work pretty well. We stuck to 28 laps for the most part but we really only saved fuel into T1. In hindsight we probably could have made 29 laps work if we worked on our fuel saving more prior to the race.

There’s a mirror view on the desktop. Used OBS Studio to capture that.
You can calibrate your 0 position. So you can move aside a little bit so one eye is in the middle.
Ah. So I assume move aside a little and reset HMD center position? Though does that mean while driving your actual viewpoint in VR is then off to the side?
Yeah but it’s barely noticeable. And for one lap its fine. Just recorded this to show some friends. For real racing I reset it again.
Got it. That makes sense. Thanks!
"Take a moment to read the sporting code as it is really helpful at answering these. 

In neither road nor oval are lapped cars required to move over or slow down or otherwise compromise their race to allow a faster car to pass. They are merely obligated to hold their line and facilitate the safest possible pass. 

However, a courteous and prudent driver will take in their surroundings and do the right thing. If you’re a lap down and the next driver in the standings is another lap down further, there’s zero reason not to just lift and move so the leader can get by cleanly. But if you have the people you’re racing right on your bumper then no, that’s silly, you don’t need to sacrifice your race for the leader. Again; just hold your line and race cleanly. 

Absolutely should not be blocking or making aggressive defensive moves."
"In races without caution, it is very bad mannered to not let the leaders pass (and might get you dumped). With cautions is a bit different, as they try to stay on the lead lap. 

Blocking is always questionable though, even when fighting for position. It's not as bad as in road racing, but don't be surprised if you get the bumper after blocking somebody."
"As a rule with me... if I'm slower, I'll move over and let people pass especially with no yellows and at non super speedways. Lots of drivers use up their tires early trying to battle up to the front which can allow you to move up if you saved your tires or due to those who wrecked being too aggressive.


If I'm running Talladega or Daytona with yellows and I'm down a lap, I'm doing everything I can to get the lap or laps back since the lucky dog can put you back on the lead lap.


Usually if you're a lap down at a super speedway with yellows, it's because you received damage from a wreck and you aren't going to be keeping pace anyway. I definitely get the hell outta the way if that's the case since I'm just churning laps for rating purposes."
"Led the leaders pass and get in their tow. Good way to make up some spots late-race, especially if other lapped cars are nuking their tires or took damage."
RKO outta nowhere!!
"Should’ve left more room there, he definitely deserved the space"
"Someone please overdub some WWE onto this.

watching this i realised it was in the same split i was in i saw him crash but because pits black out for me i could not see him crash into you i just saw what happend before it i was right behind him[my onboard](https://gyazo.com/24639744afe01cb5ee59d2a7905e8a0a) and this is [his car](https://gyazo.com/6abd04bedd94da99ee46b27050da42a7) till he blacks out

"Ooof, thats heartbreaking to see but laughed."
Wonder if the game thought the Merc was speeding in the pit lane?

That's actually the example of the terrible track design. Where's the pit wall?

Some metal parts would help on that part of the track tho.

I saw yesterday one guy loosing the back of the car there on that curve and enter on the S of the pits exit lol , and other (me) lost the rear grip braking and turning abit to move to the side of other car on that curve also and hit the wall of the pits exit .  But it was just practice , not race ."
Omg 😳
I’ve always wondered what it would be like watching a race from the infield
"  WTF? Did he ever lift? And he just continued down pit road and back into the track? Pffff, I hope he at least got a speeding in pit road penalty."
"Wow, that’s crazy. You can see when your car pops back in. Was that a tow, or just a pop back from the netherworld."
The least he could have done was at least keep you in the pit Lane. Then reverse to your box!! But geeze what a douche!!
"If only somebody could invent some kind of system or dispositive to separate the racing traffic from the pit area... I am trying to think. Something hard. Not so tall, but tall enough to stop an incoming car. (f\*daytona!)"
At least towing was short? 54 min needed repairs apart.
"You’ve just got to laugh, because otherwise you’d cry. OP - you must have been fuming at the time."
I LOVE how the other car just keeps on driving like nothing happened. Makes it seem like an assassination.

Certainly wasn't instant   


I guess having the fetch the manged wreck of our car from the paddock took some time"
It happened in the pit but he got punted all the way to Long Beach!
Somehow I think the tow was the least important bit. The wrecked car seems to be a bigger problem.
"My team always enter with an attitude of we finish the race no matter what so when the repairs came back as less time than the race had to run I knew I was going to take the flag.   
Actually I took both the green and chequered this year"
"Thank you, that is appreciated  
Sounds like your team came off worse in terms of repairs needed from that incident.I think for our team it was around 10 minutes including the tow, I feel partly due to us not actually landing on a solid surface after going over the wall.

I'd certainly hope your driver doesn't quit, accidents happen and I've had my fair share.

The new day with a fresh head it is rather funny how unlucky it was for both cars to be there that exact moment.  
For me I laugh at the fact I was in the car partly as I was the teams ""safe driver"". In the near 6 hours I'd done in the race, which included me taking the start and first 2 hours, I'd gotten 3x. All off-tracks for dipping one or two wheels in the grass. Then probably the funniest 4x I've ever got  


\*Edit\*  
Had a chance to actually watch that bit of the stream.   
The car vanished for my team too so I think I may have been the only person to see/have a full replay of what happened.   
I did actually see the front of your car in my side monitor but it was a split second before impact so too late to react.   
Ended up getting hit pretty much dead center of the car. Actually I have an alternative camera angle looking out the side window and at one point it's just filled with the front of an AMG"
"As im newly starting off in sim racing, im wondering about ""the team"". Is it common for teams to compete in iRacing races? is it just a le mans session thing? I assume its possible for multiple drivers to take over a car, when one driver is on break?"
Called hold the break instead of full throttle into the pits. left pedal is breaks.
That's only in the stalls themselves. Contact can happen in pit lane itself.
In Daytona you can.
You are doing God's work. This is going straight to my squad.
"I believe it actually happened the same day that The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table."
"I do believe I recall it either happened or nearly happened a few years ago. I distinctly remember thinking ""I've seen that in iRacing"".


But I don't recall if it was a near miss or an actual hit since my memory is probably influenced by seeing it several times on iR."
"Would you be able to share the replay file please, we don't have it."
"In propper Grand Prixs, in Europe."
"They did brake as they were loosing control but it was a really weird incident  
they basically dropped it by themselves with no influence of other cars  
The accident itself was funny but also disappointing from a 3.4k iR driver  
Like mistakes happen and I get that but with what happened I'd have maybe expected a ""sorry"" from the driver or team  


\*edit\*  
Going to come back and say credit to the team owner they messaged me post race about this.  
Especially a day later there's no hard feelings towards the team."
"It was a tow   
2ish minutes, I don't really remember the exact time but it wasn't short."
"Towing was a full laps worth as our pit box was before the start line   
Repairs were actually short but I put that mostly down to the car never actually landing"
"My head was in my hands for sure when I was suddenly back in my pit box, mostly just in shock.  


When that happened we were pretty far down anyway due to a rough race. My job was just to bring the car home safely and enjoy the experience of taking the chequered flag myself for the first time (I've finished 24s before but I've never been the driver on track for the end).  


Right before the moment of impact I was checking the right dash pages were selected on my DDU and talking with my team about the difficulty of reading German."
"Have a look through this thread, they lost control of the car. It wasn't a deliberate crash"
"Nope, Looking at other views the AMG driver made a mistake and dropped it   
Just pure luck they hit that spot"
"I was driving the P2 when it happened and I spent a good half hour laughing at it post race, as did my team.  
Ok we'd had a bad race but it was just too wierd a crash not to laugh   


Best bit, the Merc actually left the pits and did a full lap back to the pits.  
We were teleported back to our box and towed since the car landed on an area of gorund that turned out to not be solid (after wiping out an entire pit crew)"
"iRacing always tows forward, so it has to take time since you're gaining a lap."
"Teams are required for these longer special events and endurance,   
As you said like real world teams it's so you can rotate drivers. My team was 4 drivers doing triple stints, around 2h worth, then resting before their next rotation.   


I'd say generally teams in iRacing come in two forms,   
Esports style teams will probably run under a team name/livery in official and hosted events and then come together for bigger special events like Daytona. They'll generally have social media and stream races.   


The other kind of team I think is common is a group of friends/drivers from a league get together to run a special event, this is how my team is.   
So unlike Walk racing we don't have any social media or promotion outside of having a discord for our league and most of the drivers don't use that livery outside of when we run together.   


This might also be useful in explaining how it works in iRacing.

It’s any pit lane. The fast lane has contact. The stalls ghost the car out. It’s like this at every track.
Do you have a replay from their view?
So sorry for you but the way he throws you over the wall and go on about his day is absolute comedic perfection.
"We are sorry as a team, we still lack an explanation that was very weird."
">(after wiping out an entire pit crew)

That was my second thought while watching this. It's like some Death Race shit."
At least tell us you protest him. Dude should of held his breaks or quickly hit the tow button.
"Ohh, that sounds cool! Thank you for the help :)"
"So if you drive down the stalls, it would avoid a situation like this? Or is it only parked cars that are ghosted?"
"The other team have it on their stream of the event  
[https://www.youtube.com/live/xVe97x\_ESVI?feature=shared&t=18961](https://www.youtube.com/live/xVe97x_ESVI?feature=shared&t=18961)  
The car vanishes for them, actually it did for the rest of my team as well. I think at the time I may have been the only one to see the full impact."
It was your team? Damn… GG…
"Unless I'm mistaken towing wouldn't have been possible leading up to the crash. You need to be stationary for it to activate and at no point was the car stationary before impact.  


As for holding the brakes, Yes I do think the driver should have held their brakes for longer and probably tried to keep the car against the wall on drivers right. That said seeing their stream it sounds like the driver lost control of the wheel by that time.   


Also given the team from the AMG have reached out to me post race I'm willing to trust they will learn from this experience."
"Whether stopped or rolling, all cars in the stalls are ghosted. It’s often best to go straight for the stalls if you’re battling into the pits to avoid a collision. As soon as you exit the stalls into the fast lane or lanes, full collision is turned on."
First one
"Yeah, with that speed you are not stopping that car that fast. Holding the brakes I'm sure was already being done, probably with both feet lol. But sliding out of control at 170-180mph and trying to stop the thing in 300ft isn't happening lol. 

Tough and hilarious break though. Props for handling it with honor and seeing the hilarity in it. Instead of whining like crazy about a situation that's just 100% ""Shit happens"""

"I've used it pretty much flawlessly as well for quite some time. Nothing has changed except normal Quest/iRacing/Driver updates. That's what's so weird about it. It just started happening.

I always launch a session with the option for Monitor, Open VR, Oculus, and OpenXR. I almost always choose OpenXR, but I'm pretty sure I've got Oculus set to use OpenXR by default. Maybe it's that.

Today, after I dropped out of a race a few laps in when happened, I quit iRacing and the Link UI was shaky. On a hunch, I reset the guardian, and everything was smooth. I have not tried this between sessions, so I don't know if that fixes the issue or not."
"When you say turn the Q2 screen off, do you mean turn the Q2 screen off then on, do you mean put it in power save by pushing the power button? I've done that and have had some success but not 100%.

It's at least good to hear I'm not the only one. 

While I troubleshoot, I switched my link USB cable from USB 3.2 back to 3.0/3.1 to see if something happens there."
"Yeah it sounds like you tinkered a lot with the settings so it'll be hard to give feedback. 


I would suggest you reinstall and work with the basic Quest mode in iRacing. It was entirely developed to work with the Quest 2 and there are simpler ways to improve performance directly in the Oculus software. 


For the guardian question I'm assuming you're using the stationary mode yes? I've never hard guardian issues at all. "
"Pushing the power button.

I have a narrow fov multiplier in debugtool, so it might be more forgiving when having bandwitch issue (horizontal:78/vertical:50)."
"It's not hard to get a prompt for a different display type. All you have to do copy your redererDX11.ini file and name it something different.

Yeah, I've always done either the stationary guardian or just turned it off altogether. I had issues with the guardian off, so I just started using stationary.

I'll keep digging around and I'll play with some of the things that I've done.  If I find something, I'll post what I found back here.

Thanks for your input."
what is iracing quest mode and where do i find it
"At the top right of the UI to the left of your licenses you can choose between monitor, openxr, openvr, or Quest"
Because it’s a sequential shifting car. Same reason you can’t use your H-pattern on a GTP
"You can on the legacy version which is now free for everyone as of the latest iRacing patch this morning.  You won't be able to use it in any official races, but if you just want to drive an MX5 with an h pattern shifter in test drive or something you have that option."

A brick with too much down force.
"The trucks are momentum focused. Not much horsepower so even a little bobble or mistake it’s hard to recover from. They are very draft dependent too on bigger tracks, so generally the racing is very close. That makes it very exciting and super popular, but also turns into an absolute shit show 90% of the time. 

Open trucks are solid though. The field spreads out so you can actually race instead of every track being Daytona."
"They’re very areo dependent, low power and high down force pretty much make them point and shoot vehicles, at least for me that is. Definitely fun to drive if you’re in a good lobby with people who actually know how to drive!"
Tight
Thanks for all the input. Sounds like a similar drive to the Late Model Stocks. Gripped up and lower HP. I think I will give it a go.
Much like my jumpshot
And what lobby is that? 😁
The once in a blue moon lobby lmfao. Took me jumping into an xfinity race to realize 90% of truck lobbies are filled with weapons
"Somewhere between bottom and top split.    


Bottom has no talent   

Top has too much ego"
"Does xfinity require B license? If so, are there more series choices than C? I assume if I get to 4.0 on safety and already have the minimum races, I'll get promoted? I need to bone up on sporting code again."
"If you're at C 4.0 you can already race XFINITY, it's a B series but >4.0 C counts."
"I'm around 3.88 SR. I made the mistake of cruising around Draft Masters earlier to try and see if I could avoid mayhem to improve on my safety rating. As you'd expect, it went south on the first lap and I lost SR. I gained it back in the Gen 4 series. Man I'm an idiot."
"Your ergonomics are wrong for one thing, you're making steering very hard on yourself.  Check out Daniel Morad's YouTube videos on ergonomics, make adjustments and you'll have far more fine control.

Or maybe it's the camera angle, but I don't think so..."
Am interested. Just started iRacing in December after years in ACC. I’ll come back once I get my iRating up.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
"Sounds like you already know the issue. GT3 have basically no downforce in comparison to open wheel/prototype cars. 

Just slow down more. Brake trace is more of a high plateau instead of a peak and immediately bleed off."
"Brake more

GT3's have more power than downforce, so you want to V shape your corners. This will give you a slower lowest speed, but a better exit.

Brake earlier, brake more, turn in later."
Why not turn the racing line back on so you can learn the braking points for that car?
Similar path here. Learning how to throw GT cars around versus high downforce cars definitely takes some practice and change in mentality. You really want to roll the GT cars through the corner as opposed to just pushing the car deep.
"Yes you are too used to drive cars with a lot of down force.

I also feel it, worse, when switching from f4 to MX-5. That poor Miata eats sand even in a track I know well.

That's why some people say to keep driving only one or two cars, because you need to learn it again for some laps when switching."
"You need to slowdown car more and early in general on GT3 cars. Ferrari 296GT3 more than other ""don't like"" initial cornering, but good on exit. Porsche better in cornering.

Today is a patch day, test drive must work (i can be wrong), and you can to try other GT3 for free. Maybe Ferrari not for you and you will find better car."
"Ferrari has abs and traction control, if you are triggering either, you are losing quite a bit of time. Try taking it slow and feeling where those points are and try to get as close to those as possible without triggering them"
"Is it a brake hard and slowly trail brake off and coast through corner and get on the throttle. Or do you usually build up to the highest brake pressure.


Im sort of trying to find the sweet spot. Because high downforce cars you can pretty much slam the brakes drop them pretty fast and immediately get on throttle. Only very few corners do you need to leave time before u drop the brakes and get on throttle."
"Yeah might five the brake more a chance. I pretty much race f3 then in between practice the gt3, and I think switching between the two completely different types of cars is not helpful"
Ehh. More like brake brake brake brake brake then bleed off until the apex. GT cars really benefit from trail breaking.
"In an open wheel car you're probably used to losing grip under braking since the downforce comes from aero, and less speed means less aero means less downforce means less weight on the tires means less grip (think about how snappy the steering of a formula car is at 200kph and how you can snap the steering and the car will bite). That (and the lack of ABS) is why you bleed off the brake quickly and then get back on power while the car is still rotating into the corner.

But as we've established, GT3's practically don't have any downforce, especially at the front end. So you need to give more grip to the car when you want the front end to bite. You can do this by moving the weight of the car forwards by braking for longer. So yea, still brake hard and in a straight line, but as you're turning into the corner just keep a little bit of brakes on and see how that affects the car turning in. If you want to try something, Suellio Almeida (who you should totally check out) recommends trying to get the car to oversteer on turn in by using the brakes. Basically you turn the wheel a very small amount and control the rotation of the car using your brakes by releasing them and then holding them at a small amount to let the weight transfer help the car turn in but not overslow the car.

I think you will get it in no time, it's something I struggled with when I made the jump from F3/4 to GT3s (starting out with the Ferrari 488 GT3 EVO back when that was available) and now I really dislike the way open wheel cars turn since I've lamented the GT3 car feel into my head. Wouldn't change a thing though!

For example, this is a very badly and quickly put together example of turn 8 at Spa in the Formula 4 (red) and the Ferrari GT3 (blue):

EDIT: Grammar and spelling (it's late)"
"Absolutely, I did a season of w12 and had to completely relearn GT racing after that. I've been advocating for a separate SR/IR for open wheelers for years."
hmm yeah I think practice is key haha. All sim racing and games ive played till now (3 years) was open wheelers. So not understanding how a car moves is frustrating a little. Im just gonna practice and focus on brakes brakes brakes

Watch this I think it will help"
Congratulations
That’s gotta feel good. I’ve only ever won one race and I felt about the same.. but it was just a regular Tuesday night gen 4 cup race haha
gratz from car #112
Nice post Karma farmer!   /s.     Good win
Love u buddy
Congratulations brother! Must feel amazing
I can’t even get my best friend to race with the wheel I bought him… I need some friends like this lol CONGRATS!
I hate to be this guy but does a team win anything if they take first?
"As Jimmy Broadbent likes to say, it may be “just a game” but the racing and emotion is very real. Congrats brother, enjoy the high that comes with a 24h win❤️"
damn good job
"Congrats! One year I'll find a team to do this with.

I did one IMSA endurance and the Roar solo and ended up winning The Roar so now I'm hooked on endurance racing lol.

Definitely want to do more in the future."
"Well done to you and your team!! I love seeing emotions like this, I felt exactly the same way winning Sebring last year. Like a wiseman once said ""the cars aren't real but the racing is""."
Congrats!!!
do anyone know streams from this split i know only my teams and other finnish stream
Was watching abit of it last night congrats
"This is what it’s all about. Congrats, my guy"
HOLY AHIT BRO NICE!!
Congrats!
Congrats homie!!!!
Congrats!
![gif](giphy|3oFzmrqh43AvYwn9Cw)
Good job win your split with a smurf account in your team.  😂
Wait who is your team? I don’t see it on the stream……
[deleted]
"Congrats, you most have incredible team mate and work together, my team mate all left the race early I my self finish the last 3 hours race along not the best experience but finishing the race is also important IMO"
Thank you!!
"Someone downvoted you but I know how much of a joke this is LOL, thanks kev!!"
"Love you too man, from the first one in 2021"
"It is insane, thank you!!

We won the 2022 PETIT LE MANS but that was a relief really and the celebrations were mild. With the Daytona race we always had bad luck, so it was a big surprise to finally take it"
"Cuttingcorny was in this split so he streamed his GT3 POV and the Team ""MSC Puma Kuppenheim Gold"" had a commentated stream in german on twitch, their channel is called ""MMSTVlive"""
THANKS!!
Thanks man!!
Thank you!!
"Not a Smurf but alright, fairs :-)"
"En hoe kom je daar dan weer in godsnaam bij, je zou d'r niet verder naast kunnen zitten😂 maar iemand moet altijd wat te janken hebben🤷‍♂️"
Probably not top split. Were other splits streamed on the official?
"We were in another split from broadcast split ofc, we were in Split 16 with the name XEVIOUS RACING"
bro what?
You just be a happy go lucky guy 
Last year I finished the race for my team at Sebring and we ended up winning. I ran the last few hours myself while the rest of the team ran a 2nd car in another session for fun. We figured we would finish P2 but P1 crashed out with an hour to go and we ended up winning the race.
"Thank you!!

It is lots of teamwork ofc, we were preparing two weeks before the race since the driving styles by each was so different in the Porsche, leading to us having to change our setup a bit to compensate

Then again, another aspect is that we started doing endurance races together, so getting the Daytona 24 win was very special after the curse striking on us before"
tnx
"I mean homeboy has 1.2k ir with only 37 starts and a bunch of them are endurance events with you a 5k guy and your 3k buddy, seems pretty smurfy"
Oh I guess not
"He has no other account, started racing in 2022, barely raced online and only practiced, he got accused of the same thing by a team we were battling with, i didn‘t drive with him since sometime last year and even I was surprised he kept up with my times, even mentioned it in my stream"
They were official split 16 and placed 1st.
naw both you and your buddy have a slight obligation to make sure you are racing with IRs that are fair to your skill. maybe thats not the case here but.... it doesn't look like it.
"I'm new to iRacing so I apologize.

So you won your split, but you're also saying you won the total overall race (regardless of split)?

So what's the shade being thrown your way here? Smurfy?  What did the other team question about your buddy's irating? If you're fast you're fast right? It's not like you were a 5000 rating in rookies."
"No worries, I’ll gladly help you with understanding things!!

We won our split (which basically means the server we got assigned against the 49 other drivers), we won the race overall (overall win implying being the actual P1 finisher)

They just asked about him being an actual 1.2k driver (which he isn‘t IMO, he just barely gets to drive), I was surprised by his times aswell, as mentioned"
[https://www.iracing.com/nascar-game/](https://www.iracing.com/nascar-game/) updates will be posted here when ready.
Seems unlikely until 2025 tbh. They're standing up a new engine and so there's likely not a lot to show yet. 
Thanks for sending me the link. I don't know why the head of iracing couldn't reply on x with this link ?!
"I love when people scratch out the names like they are hiding something, when anyone on iRacing could look this race up in 2 seconds."
I just saw other people do it so I did it too lol
"I haven't seen this anywhere, I've seen references this could be done but I didn't find direct instructions for iRacing so I thought I'd share what I learned.

Firstly, the problem I was trying to solve was I'm getting a VR headset again but I do not run voice chat in sim and do not want to run voice chat in sim. I do however find it useful to still be able to communicate with other drivers, especially on pit stops. But I didn't want to just be bound to the quick chat messages during a race. I've heard people using Voice Attack to do commands, so I did a digging and figured this out.

Voice Attack is available directly from their website for $10 which is a little cheaper than it is on Steam. You want that program to do this.

Once you download, you want to run through Windows to have it learn your speech. I may have to do it a second time, sometimes it still doesn't quite get all of what I'm saying but commands have been flawless.

See the photos for instructions and prompts I have setup in my Voice Attack program.

If you need a walk through beyond this, I found how to set this up from this video starting at 10:25 mark

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-NZjzDj-Xk&t=625s"
Crash avoidance is a skill. I always say this and I stand by it.
"Netcode giveth and netcode taketh.

You have been giveth."
Seems worthy of submitting to iracing for their next top 10 video!
Those are some solid moves!
Net code would have taken me out in this situation
"Man that was close, great awareness! Were you keeping an eye on them down the entire start straight?"
"This happened to us at least 5 times in the 24 hour.

If the Prototype is too far back but looking to send it there's a 50/50 chance they lock up and kill you.

Best to brake more, and turn in late to let them fly by into the barrier, then go about your business actually racing.

You will see them again in 4 laps when their 3 minutes of mandatory repairs are done, rinse and repeat (they will do it again, and again)."
I wish I had this kind of sense to avoid crash. Did you hear that or see that first?
"Brooooo I'd love some of that netcode 🤣 car crashed in front of me at Spa, I was literally a good meter or more away and it still damaged my car.."
Yeah mr white! Science!
"You ever play Madden late 2000s? When quarterbacks had that total Vision passing cone?

Yours is Peyton Manning with the 99 awareness."
"What's wild is that iracing will still give you a 4x for your bumpers touching. They really need to invest in some collision technology that can take some of the data as far as braking zone, yaw angle, brake force, steering angle, direction of travel etc... and assign some blame. Or since they are lazy and like I have said countless times; just like skiing, the downhill person should never get the same amount of blame as the person behind.  At least give the car in front, half the points at least, jesus. Why would they not experiment with different methods in week 13, that would be too thoughtful I guess."
I strive to have that amount of awareness. Great job.
"The wild thing is that he moved to the inside before braking, as if he thought he was going to overtake you."
Someone has vr or triple screens haha. No chance of me doing this on a single ultrawide. I’d be straight KO’d
"Uh sounds like an idea, I will check it out, thanks mate 🫂🖤"
"I saw the replay and I still don’t know how the hell that was not a massive crash 😂

https://preview.redd.it/ay1frocj5vdc1.jpeg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5faa6dd165b06f016f394f823699d2404eeabd1"
"Not all the straight, but because I saw that weird divebomb attempt move and LMP3 tend to be a bit impatient, I raised my awareness for that guy a bit.

As soon as I heard the lose of control and lost him in the mirror, I just let Jesus take the wheel 😂😂"
"Yeah 100% to be honest I was not expecting that massive attempt of a dice bomb, at least not from that car.

He was racing alone at that point, he was not following or being followed by anyone 🥲"
Then you get the guys that fake divebomb from really far back but you need to avoid anyways because half of the time they really do divebomb from that far away 😂
"I think in this case, as I’ve been racing a lot of multi class lately, I learned (the bad way) that LMP3 tend to be a bit impatient.

In the video showing the rear view you can see that he was kinda aiming for a really weird dive bomb 🥲 (I say weird, because he was not racing anyone at that point, he was far from other LMP3 😅)

So at that point I was aware of the mirror, when I was aiming for the turn, I heard the lose of control of his car and when I was not able to see it in the mirror is when I reacted.

Btw something that helps a lot in this case, is turning the sound of your engine down a bit, I did it a couple of months ago and it does help in some cases like this."
"Yeah, this time the gods of netcode were on my side hahaha"
"https://preview.redd.it/i150uiv630ec1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4027d199f6a4bc1ee767275ba46c27f92cf4a84f

Not for me on this one 👀

About the safety rating, for me it does work as it is. It is not a blame system, just an incident system, something happens that you are a part of, you get it too.

If you race clean at the end of the day, your safety rating will improve.

For sure there could be better systems, but forza motorsport has proven that it does not work that well 😅"
"Yeah he 100% went for a divebomb, he regretted it last moment and did a panic brake (or at least that is the feeling that I get from watching the replay) 😅"
I have an ultra wide only 😂 This was virtual mirror + sound + Jesus listening to my prayers  💀
My golly
Lmao! Well definitely a lot more impressive now! 🤙
"I mean yeah most people would know not to do that lol. Well, maybe not most...but some would!

&#x200B;

At least you realize you were in the wrong here and hopefully don't try it again. :)"
"If you were fighting like that because there were other lap cars that would've otherwise taken your lucky dog, I feel ya. But otherwise yeah the best course of action would just be to sit comfy in the 2nd train and hope people wreck away from you. 

Did you get friendly and supportive pms in your chatbox after that? The superspeedway regulars are always the nicest people I hear"
"I’m sure by now even you think your name was changed to dumbass after being called it for so long lol. 

Shit happens. Yes it’s a simulator but it’s just a game. No one died. No one lost their sponsor. And everyone gets to race again."
"Why did the other guy go up,  and then right back down? Maybe that's a shifty move?"
"unpopular opinion but you should be able to race the race regardless of laps down, you never know what might happen and anything less than trying 100% to still win is just giving up. There's definitely the caveat of being smart, trying to finish, not getting penalties, and not ruining other peoples races sure but a genuine mistake while racing is just that, regardless of being laps down or not imo. No-one is suddenly more entitled to the track and space because of their position. By extreme opposite case you can't take risky moves on backmarkers because you believe you're entitled to the track more than they are, which also happens all to often imo.

I totally don't understand ovals though, so there's possibly things i'm missing here too."
This is far too oval for me to understand. Congrats to you. Or I’m sorry that happened. At least it sounds like you had fun and that makes me happy
"I don't have a problem with healthy lap cars running up front especially when there's still 25 laps to go. I would've been content to just run laps near the back and watch half the field take each other out. Then you can maybe get a top 15. FYI, I never register and then eat because at some point there will be an issue that delays me. Every time I try to squeeze in a meal before a race, I'm always eating twice as fast and I still never make it in time for the grid."
"The real problem is the drivers in ovals more than anything.

The only real etiquette as a lapper in oval is if you're slower than the leaders, stay out of the way when they come by.

Unfortunately, in some of these folks' eyes, that is less etiquette and an absolute rule and if you're a lap down you're supposed to just pull over and not exist. Of course, watch the same guys when they're laps down and they suddenly remember they're entitled to exist.

There is something to be said about not racing leaders super hard, especially if you have no chance, but twenty-five laps at a superspeedway? I've won races when being multiple laps down with good pit strategy and lucky yellow flags."
That’s going to be one very aggressively worded protest by that caddy team
FFS its a 24 hour race. Will calling for a tow REALLY cost you THAT much?!?
What a dickhead lol. Glad to see unsafe re-entries happen at every level lol
Honestly that should be a ban. No reason this dude couldn’t back up if he was hellbent on turning that car around. Complete moron.
Rejoins like that should result in lengthy bans from the platform.
So much stupidity in these races. In nearly every endurance race I have done only the top couple of cars are on the lead lap with nearly everyone else down by multiple laps. Just keep it clean and you will nearly always get a good finish.
I feel the pain.. thhis happened to us at 22.5 hours... [https://streamable.com/0a1p7k](https://streamable.com/0a1p7k) taken out by a crazy GTP driver
"That's disgusting.

The GTP in front of me murdered P2 in GT3 with less than 10 minutes to go. Zero apology for it to. Twas straight up murder."
What’s the SOF ? Always wondered how many splits there were during this race. Too lazy to actually look it up
Yup
"And... even if he hasn't killed the GTP, he would get a 40s. penalty... he took the worst possible decision... what a fucking moron!"
"He could have just pulled onto the grass to let the GT3 by, then did an Austin Powers."
"The best part, he didn't even need to tow. There's enough space for an awkward back up and turn around on the pit exit road there. And he chose entering the track and ignoring relative instead."
"If you're spinning on pit road, calling for a tow here should have zero noticable effect on your race. "
"I mean tbh it depends on the split. Realistically, in a high split that driver shoulda towed and quit the race because no way they’re making up 3+ minutes.

Think about how fast being 5 seconds per lap faster than the car ahead feels. Then realize that to make up a tow you’d have to maintain that for 36 laps, or like 72 minutes"
Right? I’d rather be a lap down. We almost got taken out at the bus stop where a GTP panicked and parked it on the entry.
"Nope, there is a “push to pits” discount you get if you have to two while close to or in the pit lane."
Uh yeah it will. It will put you outside of the top 10 for sure. Not defending this moron btw.
well I mean if the overlay is accurate this driver was only 1.7K so it's more expected here than anywhere else
I hope the GTP driver protested it but if not I saved the replay.
We were able to stay out of serious danger by keeping it somewhat clean. We started P15 and ended P2 but a lot of close calls.
I don’t know if it’s lack of sleep but people started to do dumb things towards the end.
"Was it the #4 timeslot and into t1? If so, my team was in that race and almost got taken out 20 minutes before that from the same GTP. We ended up taking P2 because of that and they dropped to P6."
This was #11 split 1.9K and there was 16 splits at our timeslot #4
"A car did that in my race. It was low-key hilarious, a top 3 highlight from the race. It was a legit 5-6 point turn lol"
"Have you ever completed a 24h race? It's pretty difficult to get through in one piece. 22h in the leader of GT3 was 2 laps ahead of p2 an me (p3) and then suddenly gets killed by a GTP. Running 2 laps down and suddenly i was fighting for a class win. 

Never give up in endurance, theres so many things that can happen"
"

18 hours in is 6 hours left. 360 minutes. Just under 200 laps remaining at GTD (GT3) pace. I dont think pushing for 1/3 of that remaining time is unreasonable if you're on pace."
It’s accurate this was the 11th Split in 4th timeslot
"Just FYI that you can protest even if it didn't happen to you. I'd be shocked if the other team didn't, but considering it takes all of a minute to clip the relevant section, write a couple sentences of what happened and attach the replay file, I'd just do it as well if you can spare the time."
We were leading the race and one of our team made a mistake that cost us 11 minutes. Ended up 9th
"yeah man, I think perception changes, this look bigger than they are, timing goes off, and voila you have an incident.. I guess thats what makes 24hr races so hard. Lets hope Nords will be better or Spa.."
"Yeah, I’ve done majors garage 24 hour Le Mans since iRacing lost the ability to host a 24 Le Mans as well as iRacing 24 Le Mans, 12 Sebring, Petit Le Mans, and 24 Daytona 2 years now, as well as occasional IMSA enduros and some 6 and 12 hour races in ACC. Our team has DNF’d from 3 or 4 of them.

Like I said before, it depends what you’re there for.  For one, if I was P2 after a tow, I wouldn’t DNF. But if I’m out of the running for the podium I’m probably going to leave. It’s fine not to, I’m just not interested in just driving around."
"Yeah but I intentionally used an outlandish example. How often do you have 5 second pace differential in a race? It’s rare. 

A realistic one would be 0.5seconds per lap, which is honestly still a huge difference. That would require a full 6 hours of pushing and maintaining that gap to make it up."
We could say he was blocking us trying to exit the pit 🤷🏾
"Well with Nords it’s GT3, Porsche Cup, GT4 and Touring car so the field should be pretty spread out hopefully."
"You said 5 seconds?

 I just cannot fathom how you could think that quiting with 6 hours remaining on a 24hr race would be preferable to towing and continuing. 1.5-2 laps down."
"Lol I meant you could protest the unsafe rejoin (I guess that's what you'd call it?) on behalf of the Cadillac team. Like I said, just because an accident happened to someone else doesn't mean you can't submit a protest—and multiple protests for the same incident certainly isn't a bad thing.

Hell, I've submitted probably twice as many protests in my iRacing career for things I saw but wasn't directly involved in, just because that's one of the ways of maintaining the relatively good standard of racing we get on the platform."
"I guess it depends on what you’re there for. If you’re there to drive around, sure. If you’re there to fight for a podium or to really compete, then why shouldn’t you? Saves yourself 6 hours of pointless driving and it’s not like some sponsor is going to be mad you didn’t get “camera time”

Edit:
And yeah I know I said 5 seconds. I then pointed out that I used that as an outlandish example to make the point that you’re *never* making up the gap to the field in any reasonably competitive split. As the comment you replied to said."
People like you are one of the reasons I’m thinking about getting into iRacing. I hope to see more people follow in these footsteps.
Strictly speaking not a dedicated SA group but we do host a few SA’s in the Just An Average Sim Racer Discord here https://discord.gg/Xx9Spcdr6F

3 wide going into the kink is a bad move regardless of whether it was successful.
Who dares wins
0.8k nutshell
Very stupid
"It’s aggressive but personally a good move. I ran gt3s in the 24. I’d actually prefer you to make that move than try to have all 3 cars going into the next horseshoe. The gt3 wasn’t actively battling another car, quick lift before the kink for the gt3 and fall in behind. Perfect balance imo"
"Brave, well done!"
The only item that's up for debate about being offside is the portrait landscape video.
What is this overlay positioning?   So much screen clutter.  Irk how you can turn even 1 clean lap like that.
"Thanks, others clearly don’t seem to think so even tho there was zero contact and space was also left on the inside but I guess you wouldn’t know that without the chase cam 🤷🏽‍♂️ the downvote mafia is in full effect 🤣"
Im sorry 😭😭 don’t hate me lol
Besides the see through track map nothing blocks the road all the over lays are either in the car and the standings just slightly pop into the windshield at the top. You get used to it
"1. Could be, but it depends. How close are we talking, was it in the braking zone, did the attacking car actually have a run, etc.

2. Breaking draft is not blocking. I don't care what kind of backwards Narnia world way anybody tries to interpret the sporting code, if they are actively trying to **not** be infront of you, idk how anyone with a functioning brain can possibly say it's blocking. 

That said, weaving back and forth all over the track could be considered wreckless driving, especially if the following car isn't even trying to stay in the lead cars draft anyways (which I have seen). That kind of thing I wouldn't say is breaking draft as much as it is someone being dumb at best, or actively trying to be a road hazard at worst."
"First is legal unless cutting back to the racing line forces you to correct your line/braking (which it often does). 


 Second is legal."
"There’s a difference between breaking the tow and dangerously weaving. Typically that’s a matter of how close the attacking car is, braking zones etc. scenario one is similar. Legal. Can be very dangerous though to expect the trailing to brake when you do if you pull over with zero space between (I did this to a gt3 in an lmp2 at Monza and was rear ended, I’m to blame)."
"\#1. You are allowed to make a single defensive move on the straight and then a return to the race line for the corner if deemed safe. If you have space to move in front of the trailing car to setup for the corner then go for it.

\#2. Trying to break a tow is not blocking. Its is doing the exact opposite of blocking."
"Everybody says #2 is fine but the sporting code is pretty clear:

>However, blocking occurs when a leading driver actively adjusts his or her driving line based on the actions and/or positioning of a pursuing driver 

Sounds to me like #2 is blocking.  It doesn't specify in the sporting code ""Only if they're trying to break the draft"""
[deleted]
It seems like everyone is saying #2 is legal but I’ve been taught that’s you’re only allowed one move for defense and anything else is driving dangerously
"Neither is blocking. Defending is moving primitively, blocking is moving reactively. 

In my experience, swerving to break the draft is more counter-productive than productive."
Neither of them is blocking.
"Situation 2 is definitely not blocking. While the wording of the rule suggests it might be, the spirit of the rule does not, and the stewards won't penalize it.

Situation 1 is risky business. If you're really far enough ahead that the other car won't get alongside before turn in, it's fine. But if you have already chosen a line (whether defensive or the racing line), and then move in front of someone just before braking, and they have to brake harder or take avoiding action to not hit you, that is moving under braking and an illegal block. So in case #1, if the leading car gets punted, it is their own fault."
"Legal, but the MOMENT the trailing car gets an overlap, any contact is on the leading car."
"There is no ""one move"" rule in iRacing. Any defensive move in reaction to the car behind is an illegal block."
"There needs to be some clarification in the rules, because if a car is .7 behind they aren't passing you on the straight before you know what happened. If they continue to get closer at a certain point you must hold the line because then you ARE impeding them. You're not impeding someone from occupying a space when they are over half a second behind."
"a couple months back someone shared the result of a protest on this.

Conclusion was: swerving to break the draft is **allowed**."
"As another person pointed out, the leading driver actively trying NOT to be in front of a pursuing driver means they are trying to get out from in front of them (thus breaking draft), which is the opposite of blocking. The pursuing driver is therefor reacting to the leader. The sporting code uses an example:

> For example, veering left to prevent a pursuing driver from passing on the left while running on a straight.

In this case, the leader would be moving opposite the direction of the pursuer. It would be the exact opposite of the only example that iRacing uses in the sporting code. And perhaps most importantly, in practice it is not penalized as blocking, therefor on iRacing it is not blocking."
"There is no ""one move"" rule in iRacing"
No such thing in iRacing and breaking the draft is the exact opposite of blocking. It’s not driving dangerously until you hit somebody and a smart driver will stop trying to break the draft long before there’s an overlap
"I would argue that you don't even need overlap, but close to it. Like, if I'm attacking you and there's half a foot between us and you chop my nose off as we enter the braking zone, I'd call that either blocking or suicidal, not sure which."
"But if they move low first, it is not in reaction. They are still entitled to return to the racing line."
"You are arguing about it not being a ""rule"" but, it is a standard that the stewards use. A single move that impedes the driver behind is going to be classified as a defensive move and therefore allowed. Another impeding defensive move following the first one, that is not taking you back to the race line for corner entry, is going to be classified as blocking and illegal. 

Just because its not explicitly stated doesn't mean its not implicit. You are arguing semantics."
"I really wish they would clarify this in the sporting code.

A lot of time in oval indy racing, when you break the draft, the idea is to break it down the straight and then throw dirty air over the pursuing driver behind you at corner entry.  Which means getting directly in front of the preferred line before the corner which 99% of the time would mean in front of the pursuing driver's line.  If you leave the inside open (and don't block the pursuing driver's run) they will pass you with clean air, defeating the entire point of breaking the draft.

Maybe in road its different but in oval, 100% this would be in reaction to a pursuing driver since you wouldn't weave and then get in front of somebody like this unless somebody was behind you."
"They're allowed to move as many times as they want in that case as it is a proactive move and not a reactive move. What I'm trying to get at is you can't make any sort of reactive move to block the car behind. The ""one move"" rule is an F1 rule, not an iRacing rule"
">A lot of time in oval indy racing, when you break the draft, the idea is to break it down the straight and then throw dirty air over the pursuing driver behind you at corner entry.

Just for clarity, you aren't talking about how they run the long straights in like the Indy 500 are you? Where they drift down toward the apron on the straights and then go back toward the outside wall for corner entry? Because they aren't doing that to break draft. They drive that line because the wheels are staggered and the car naturally drifts left. Allowing the car to drift and then correcting for corner entry saves tire and doesn't scrub off speed from fighting the car."
"I think the oval consideration is definitely different than road to an extent. I personally don't know enough about open wheel oval etiquette to have an opinion there, but the scenario you describe does sound tricky. To your point, I fully agree that clarification would be awesome."
"Yes I know this. Just pointing out that in their example, the lead car moved inside first so it's not reactionary and is fine."
I mean that's half correct.  Snaking can save tires but it isn't only for that.  Making it more difficult to pass is a major consideration.
"As mentioned in comments of the [original video](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/19c3f2n/so_this_was_not_how_i_expected_to_start_my_last/): ""Someone please overdub some WWE onto this.""  


So I did"
"Probably 1:15 optional on the LMDh, and 35:00 required on the Merc."
"Bah gawd as my witness, he is broken in half!"
Casually drives away.
Thank you so much man!
Fuckin Legend
"LMP2 actually   
Was 6:00 ish required, 0:55 optional   
Probably helped by phasing out of existance once over the wall"
"wow this looks like some sort of netcode issue or something, with the cars glitching inside of each other"
"I feel like you know the answer, is there any doubt with this one?"
Red car’s at fault. Looks like netcode glued you together after contact. But POV car is alongside and on a predictable line and red turns in.
"Both and neither. 

Porsche is being unpredictable, missing the apex of a easy flat corner. (See how the McLaren ahead does it. Missing that costs you time btw)

Mercedes is asleep at the wheel, not noticing the porsche has missed the corner.

Netcode is the killer, this should've just been a 0x bonk and nothing more. Magnet mode went off on one here"
Red car. But why weren’t you turning around the kink there and trying to straight line it?
"One way to help these, don’t leave a cars width between y’all. Run out next to him to prevent him from being able to turn down so much. Don’t have to squeeze or be weird about it, but just close that space some and you’ll find you’ll be the one in control of the next corner"
Appreciate the feedback everyone. I like to get unbiased opinions in these scenarios. Me and the red car were racing it out pretty good for a couple laps so I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about this correctly!
"We were racing it out pretty well. I (number 8) wound up cutting in and getting more grip out of that last turn which put me ahead.Doesn't seem like he (number 17) was heading for the line. I will also note, I was not turning in on him, my car was turning because of where he was hitting me at. I was trying to pull off but couldn't. Feel free to ask me question, I'm trying to learn from experiences like these.  I also recorded both onboards if that would help."
"Think I should report for the technical glitch?

Edit: whats up with the downvotes? I didn't even know what netcode was until today lol. Only been playing for a month."
"After I watched the on boards, I questioned it more. I'm not sure how well he could see me. He doesn't necessarily make a hard cut over but he definitely is taking an odd line."
"People on this sub downvote like crazy over stupid things.  No you shouldn't report this driver.  Even if it wasn't netcode, it was likely an accident."
"He has a spotter saying ""car on the left"", ""still there"", ""hold your line"".

There's no reason why he shouldn't be aware that you're there, it's his fault."
"Thank you! I wasn't sure if I could report it just as the tech issue, and not report that player themselves"
"Very good point, I wasn't thinking about the spotter"
"I get what you mean now.  Netcode like this is pretty common. You could try reporting it to technical support, wouldn’t hurt"
Looks great when enabled after a few tweak. This led me to the rabbithole of other improvements I could make playing around with openxr settings and now iracing looks clearer and runs better than ever before. Thanks for the tip!
Is this specific to a gpu manufacturer?
"yes, every video or game or photograph has some sort of tonemapping on it"
"I enabled it for my triples about 6 weeks ago and there’s no going back, it looks much more photorealistic. I had to adjust gamma and brightness settings after I made the switch to improve things, but out of the gate the colors just looked a lot more natural. Apparently this is still a work in progress by the dev team, so will maybe even get better."
I have a G2 and want to try this.  Where is the .ini file located?
Your local user’s Documents folder.  Typically something like C:/Users/<username>/Documents/iRacing
Thanks!
What are you doing on the track you GT3 peasant.
I don’t know how this dude hits you on a straight. There’s so much room there.
I can’t count how much moves I saw like this. Not always with this ending but so much so unnecessary close moves…
So kind of them to do that right next to the pits for you
"You move 3/4 of an inch off the yellow line.

LMDh need lots of space, like to side draft, and or brush lightly against your bumpers as they pass you 60 kph faster.

Definitely the GT3s fault... /s"
What an asshole
"This is what drives me crazy when prototypes drive so stinking close to you while passing. It's like they've never heard of netcode. 

I'm an lmp2 and the only time I got close to a gt3 on the banking was when there was an lmdh going around me at the same time making it 3 wide. Otherwise I would give the gt an extra half lane."
"This is why I give as much space as possible when passing. This wasn't netcode but I'm terrified of doing this to someone because of netcode. 

Sometimes weird passes are required as the situation dictates, but this wasn't one of those times."
Dafuq
"These idiots think they're Felipe Nasr when they pull that quick cut-down shit but don't even have enough spacial awareness not to cut through the nose of your car. 

Anyone causing a wreck doing that shouldn't be allowed to drive an LMP ever again."
GTP drivers are why I stopped running IMSA. So many moves like this one have cost me wins.
Instant protest
If this is from the Stream from Patrick Richter´s Team than it was a ghost contact. They watched it in the Replay the LMDh did not hit them.
"It blows my mind seeing videos like this. I'm on a single, non ultra wide 27"" and still haven't done anything this bad lol.

I don't get what some people find so difficult about giving space. I'm pretty sure all of my recent crashes have been me over driving and stuffing it instead of this insanity."
How is anybody hitting you on that part of the track?? That guy is clearly an asshat!!
Right? Stock cars easily go 3 wide and sometimes even 4 wide through there. In packs
"As a GTP driver, I would say that sometimes this happens and is not on purpose, I'm not saying that the gtp is not at fault but ita happens and trust me that it hurts also for the gtp driver ( for like 5 seconds)"
"And when they are 30 car lengths back and ""fake"" like they are going full send.

The GT3 has to react because 10% of the time, they DO full send from 30 car lengths back and send it right off the track, straight through the GT3."
He almost knocked him right into his box
For what?  Unless you can prove they did this on purpose they’ll just reject it
This is from my solo imsa race. Watching from outside view there is over half a car overlap when the gtp turns left.
"It's all about the draft!

(Love those GTP's who run straight up your clacker until the last second to get every  little bit of draft possible.)"
"Just race the car.

Everyone in rookies sucks for the most part. It can be nerve-wracking, but just do the races. After the first lap or two, it's mostly hot lapping anyways because everyone spreads out so much. 

Here's a good video I like to share with new folks:
[Danny Lee - You're Needed on the Grid](https://youtu.be/gGphb-gOWQI?si=h7F5kgZOcXcOiCu8)"
Depends how you learn. Some react well to being chucked in the deep end. Some don't. I would give ai a couple hundred more laps and then tackle rookies online. They're called rookies for a reason - you're allowed to make mistakes. Good luck have fun!
"If you can run 10 laps in a row without spinning out just jump into a race. 


The problem with racing against AI is they're very, very passive compared to human players. You might build some bad habits out of what to expect out of the other cars. 


If you can run clean laps just jump into the deep end and welcome to the show. "
"The Rookie MX-5 races aren't rolling starts so you should tweak your AI races to match.

Do another AI race or two then jump in to a real race. In the beginning you mainly need to learn how to avoid crazy drivers which the AI won't prepare you for. Be sensible, don't try to overtake everyone in the first corner and you'll be better than 50% of those in your race. Have fun!"
"Rookies is made for that. Those who are naturally good or who have experience in other sims will be on front anyway, and make their way out of rookies very fast.
If you are just a beginner, don't do too many hot laps, and I would not recommend IA racing either. Jump in the car, drive against other rookies, learn to make your way out of the chaos and you'll make progress in no time.

Also you can practice by driving in a spectated session, it's very useful to compare your pace with thr leaders and see where you are losing time; when a session is live, click on ""watch"" and the game will allow you to drive in thr field; people racing won't see you so no risk to disturb them, and there won't be any collision and no consequences for mistakes
Pretty neat for beginners!"
"If you're comfortable with being able to lap tracks without major issues now's the time to start racing others. Being nervous is fine, everyone will be at first and everyone will make mistakes. 

Rookies is all about learning survival and racecraft, you can always focus on getting quicker once you're accustomed to being on track with others. 

Starting slow and safe is far better than quick and reckless; just focus on finishing races first and worry about where you finish once you've built up some confidence with the car."
"Don't worry, just get comfortable with the car and race. Everyone in rookies is there for a reason, and you may even win a few races very quickly. Have fun!"
"You can even just join rookie practice sessions that have a bunch of people in it to start with.  Just driving around with them before racing.  But as others said, if you can drive around the track by yourself a few laps in a row cleanly then you can race.  AI is so different than humans.  AI has a place in the tool box but human unpredictability is is magic :) Frustrating magic but magic just the same... You will learn way more and that's what you need now."
"Spend some time in the rookie rally car.  You'll learn some valuable skills, plus imprint muscle memories that will help you get more performance from the MX5."
"Some people need practice and some can just go all i. I personally just started racing without any practice (i’ve had gt7, assestto corsa, dirt 2.0, beam, etc.). I just try and stay consistent, I didn’t try passing or pushing, i just wanted to finish my races without any incidents. then when i actually got a ranking, i started trying to pass and push. Everyone is different, best way to find out is trying"
"Pratice sessions in rookie class are a great way to learn. Also, watch track guides for the car you are driving to learn braking and turn in points etc. that really helps. I also just started in December."
"I’m 3k and still nervous as fuck in the first few laps of a race. Like, legs shaking so much I can’t even press the throttle nervous. But that’s what makes Iracing amazing, your brain really thinks you’re in a real car driving a real race"
"Get some time in test drive to learn the track, get some time on a practice server to see how other people are lapping, and how far off their times you are. You'll be able to follow and battle other drivers without the stress of race position, and the field will be more spaced out. Make sure you can run 10 clean laps, or whatever the race length will be, at a reasonably consistent pace, with few 1x's. When you think you are ready, run AI race to get a feel for how the braking points change in traffic, so you don't rear end people. Then run some races.

Honestly, I find the Vee a much easier car to drive than the MX5, and more fun, once you learn to only use 3rd and 4th gear (aside from off the line) to avoid spinning. Quicker route out of Rookies, unless you love the MX5 of course."
best advice.
"moving back using the camera does not change your FOV, it only changes your seating position."
By using the camera you mean ctrl f12? Is that the same of different than using shift or alt plus the bracket buttons ?
Still changes how it looks. Feels off. Guess I gotta live with it
"Yes Ctrl f12. You can't move the seat backwards while in the car (stupid IMHO). 

In the car you can only change your height and pitch. The bracket buttons only make the same adjustments that are in the f9 black box."
It only changes how the interior looks. The exterior looks the same.
"Hmmm I am able to move backwards using some combo of shift , but that could mean I’m Changing fov not moving the seat ?"
"Maybe it’s just up and down. But I swore I could. So in ctrl f12, what is it you change specifically to move back? Just the basic x or y axis sliders?"
Correct you're changing FOV. That's why it's looking weird.
Yes
"I believe it's the x axis (it's on the far left).

The most you can push it back is -0.250."
Appreciate ya.
Im not sure many people save the replays of 24 hour races. Its a lot of memory for a 45 minute race
"Damn, good thinking reaching out here. I was in your race as well in the GT3 cars. I hope you find it and can pass it along as well."
Start messaging people in your split.
How big of a fine would that even be? It would have to be huge.
Thanks! I'll probably make a post in the forums as well since there's only so much traffic here.
One of my teammates saved a replay of ours (not OPs split) and it came out to just under 42GB
Lol imagine having OP in your split for the Daytona.  24 hours of being being congratulated for good passes.
This is hilarious
"Are you using any external programs like CrewChief? I’ve never seen this issue, but I don’t think iRacing has any feature that automatically selects a number for chat automated messages."
"woah, i was in this lobby. i can say that it was pretty funny. cant believe people got mad about it"
"Turned off CrewChief and it went away! Turned it back on and it came back immediately. Will be checking on their Forums for some info as again, I didn't see anything in those settings. Thanks all!"
The voice recognition stuff in crewchief can do that.
The Positive Affirmations engine for the new build is *fantastic*
I agree haha. Some others in my lobby did not agree and were very angry with me.
"Yes, using CrewChief and Racelab. I’ll investigate the settings on those and see what I find."
Good to know! Someone in a forum over there said it may be one of the Macros. Gonna check it out tonight.
You can mute individual drivers by right clicking their name in chat so it’s not even that big a deal
Yeah easy to do while racing
"The V8 Supercar? Very carefully, and with the understanding it is waiting to kill you should you show any sign of weakness. "
"If you're spinning out every time you brake, try moving the brake balance forward (percentage number up). 

Your rear tires are locking up before your front tires. The result is that the rear end spins around.

It's worth noting that the V8 Super is **by far** (in my opinion) the most difficult car in iRacing to be fast in. I can't think of any car that requires the same level of precision on braking and throttle inputs."
If you think you can drive this is a good car to bring you down to earth.
Guess I should mention it’s the V8 super car
They have spool rear ends I think so you need to be really smooth with pedal inputs. I remember SVG talking about the difference in driving them vs the Cup Cars at the Chicago race and how much more finesse is needed for the Aussie V8’s.
Blipping the throttle on downshifts really helps.
Finesse. You have to be really gentle with the pedal inputs.
"Brake lightly and don't lock up, it's pretty easy if you're not overdriving. If you come into the corner and lock up then next time brake lighter and also reduce the brake bias."
Overemphasize the throttle blip
Do you mean the GTP maybe?  Like the prototypes?  HyperCar?
"You really have to get some heat in the tires and try to finesse it. Downshift blips are a must, and you have to brake a lot earlier than you think."
"Maybe I’ll save myself the $ and just follow Supercars IRL, haha… but I really wanna give the Bathurst 1000 a go."
"It’s big, heavy, high horsepower and a torque monster, getting out of a corner without sliding takes immense throttle control."
I absolutely love the v8. It might be my favorite if the series actually had any racers but it’s so dead now days. 2-3 years ago it was amazing. Now I’ve moved pretty much exclusively to the Porsche cup car and find it’s a similar racing experience. Though I do miss the feeling of that car sliding all over the place.
I use hand clutch so I just use both the hand clutch and pedal to downshift. I also just hit the gas a bit in the meantime to stabilise the car. It’s a hard car to drive for sure
treat it like riding a huge scorpion. all fun and games but it can sting you to death any second if it's in the mood
I simply can't drive it. My right foot is to heavy. It's the most insane technical car in the game. Faster than a gt3 but then can't stop and weighs more than bus. Mega cool cars though
"Adjusting the brake boosters also helps with braking. 
There’s some notes in the open setups from Iracing."
With great difficulty
"> and with the understanding it is waiting to kill you should you show any sign of weakness.

Just like 90% of Australian animals."
"While generally true, the V8 is prone to diff locking, and many a first time V8 driver gives up annoyed because they keep locking the diff even as they wind the bias all the way forward since it has a similar effect. 

The key to mitigating diff locking is to be very deliberate with your downshifts and work on your manual blipping. You can actually get away with running a pretty far rearward bias if you have a good handle over the shifting and weight transfer which opens up a lot of speed."
Does the style of driving make you a better gt3 driver? Im not a fan of the Porsche cup but i want a car that’s going to improve my driving skills
Gen 4 cup car?
Lol aren't you exaggerating a little bit... the Mercedes F1 maybe?
Harder than that shit Porche cup car? Didn't think that was possible..
Sadly a lot of this. Maybe driving it and Bathurst for the first time at the same time wasn't the best idea though...
"Wouldnt say its impossibly hard. If you have patience and understand that you should definitely underdrive it rather than overdriving it, then you should be good to go. You just cannot throw this car around, there isnt much tolerance for overdriving. Understeer and corner entry, oversteer at corner exit. 

But it is a ton of fun. Ive only driven one of the Bathurst 1000 raced with it, loved it. But no teammate was interested in driving that race with me the following years, so every now and then I remember that race fondly. And how my teammate whos usually very fast, was 3s a lap slower than me because he just didnt have that patience in his driving style. In normal lmp2/gt cars he also has massively higher tyre wear than me, so it does make sense that he just sucks in those Supercars that punish that sort of pushing the car slightly beyond its limits driving style."
"not just helps, i find an absolute necessity"
"It doesnt just help, its pretty much necessary."
No the V8. Sorry should’ve specified
There's literally only one class of car in the sim titled supercars
"It's cheaper to fly to Monaco 1st class from Bathurst, than going to Bathurst for the 1000."
90% of Australian drivers who pick up hitch-hikers
Diff lock? The diff is locked. There’s no slip to it.
"Theoretically it should make you better in anything because it teaches (very much by force, same as the Porsche) smooth application of brake, throttle, and steering, while also severely punishing you for going over the limit. Those are good baselines to have no matter what you're driving but considering V8SCs have low downforce, I'd say it's more immediately useful in something like GT3, yeah."
"The style of driving is very different. If you dislike the way the Porsche Cup drives, you'll probably hate the V8SC. It's like the PCup with far less downforce and mechanical grip, and 2 or 3 hundred extra horsepower. You end up getting a really sense of how to get a car to rotate with throttle blips and braking technique.

I think it's helped me improve my skills in PCup more than anything. Tire management is very key to consistency in the races. Spinning up the rears out of a corner even once can and will ruin your race.

It's one of those cars that always fascinated me. All of the above should be a reason to hate the car. But when you get it right, you just feel invincible. It's super satisfying."
"if the Gen 4 raced 1,000km at Bathurst, then maybe"
Yeah those old cup cars are brutal to drive considering that the current generation of Nascar cup cars were based in part on the V8 Supercars in an effort to improve their road racing capabilities.
"I've never raced that car so it is difficult for me to compare. It sounds like it would be a handful, though!"
"I'm not exaggerating, this is just my opinion.

I've never really raced the F1 car but I'm sure it's not easy to be faster in, either!"
Bathurst is also just plain brutal in a v8sc. Every single one of the many small bumps in that road is just waiting to throw you straight into the concrete barrier. There's a reason that race carries so much prestige haha
You talking bout  the Jetta supercar series
Interesting but I’m talking about racing the Bathurst 1000 on iRacing
Except the hitch-hiker is a giant toxic spider 🤣🤣
You have to uncheck the “welded diff” option in the set up menu
"lol, yes, very much by force! You can easily kill your tires on an outlap if you're not careful. Learned that lesson many times."
That could be arranged…
we can easy say without anyone arguing it's the Hardest car to drive in the sim.
"6.10.2. Driving in the opposite direction of race traffic after a driver has completed a Race will result in a one-lap penalty, 
assessed in the final scoring. *At the conclusion of any multi-car session, drivers must either return safely to pit lane or 
bring their car to a safe stop off the racing surface so as not to create an incident hazard for other competitors still at 
speed.*


Its protestable.

Honestly, ill never understand why people dont just do a cooldown lap. Are you so rushed that you can't wait 2 minutes to get back to the pits? Of course there are exceptions like Nords and LeMans."
"Just in general, yeah. 

And remember you still gain SR after the race is over until the last driver crosses the line or disconnects. So lots of people are still going to be racing to the pits."
"Protip: stop before the start finish line and let another car push you across to save fuel

I’ve obliterated someone before where they actually started slowing down before the start finish line in a trioval as we were racing for position.

Even worse if somebody crashes in your car before the race begins. This happened to me yesterday in a F3 race in Indy. A jump start into my car. Everything imaginable is possible on iRacing
There is no reason why iRacing can't ghost everyone's car after they cross the finish line so that there are no collisions from people stopping to logoff.
I really wish it didn’t count incident points after checkered. This issue would not exist if we could simply off track after passing the line.
The worse in oval racing when everyone is racing and crashes after the start finish line causing a 4x. I get not ramming into people after the race on purpose but going like 3-4 wide and then crashing after the start finish sucksss
I usually just send it into oblivion after the race. It’s been working.
A cooldown lap also earns you more corners towards your safety rating until every racer completes their race. Free SR.
No time I have to pee.
I protested that in the past and it was upheld.
I always go until the time resets. The only time I don't is if someone put me in a bad mood to where I just can't give a shit to stay in the race another 2 minutes and get a SR. But otherwise yeah.
i dont think you should get an off track for doing that. maybe it automatically gets taken away and ive not noticed in my short time but ive noticed i get the point at least.
"Why exactly *would* I do a ""cooldown lap""?"
Or lose SR…..
"Even if you wanted to hop off as soon as possible to make the next race, Alt+F4 is quicker, and puts the cars behind you in less danger than stopping."
There's no reason why people can't stop driving like self centered twats for 2 minutes after the checkers.
But... but realism
"Judging by the negative votes here, people prefer ramming into each other after the race. Go figure..."
"If you go off track at under 25 or 30 mph, you don't get an off track. Just round T1 and pull off slow."
"I've been doing it my entire iR career. It's free SR, take it.

....I also race primarily ovals so it's almost necessary to do at least half a lap anyway."
Also it's a sim and you don't just stop after the line irl and disappear 😆
Catheter... or diaper.
"SR still counts after you cross the finish line, unless you’re the last car or the race timer is finished. Just do a cooldown lap"
"If you are going slow enough, it will not register the off track"
"The race isn't over until the last car crosses the line. So, the first answer is to not be a jackass blocking people still racing. 

Plus, you get free SR corners until the last car crosses the line."
Please *at least* get through the first corner before you slow down excessively.
Indeed!
Fuckkkkk
Thats me
"You know that, and I know that, but the kid in the Red Bull livery and Senna Helmet doesn't know that."
Yeah but then you can't save the replay can you?
They are stopping 'To Log Off.' LOL realism.
"Yea. See I had read the racing code, but noticed that most folks pulled off after finish and called a tow to quit. So I started doing that, and parking just off track everywhere. Couldn't for the life of me figure out where my INC count was going up by two. Until I read this here a couple weeks ago. From that point on, I've planned on lapping back to pit after the flag just to be safe."
It only counts until the timer resets.
Yeah either they should be required to pit after or they should ghost. This in-between thing seems goofy
"The black box that comes up by pressing F1 has a timer. Once the leader crosses the line, that timer will start counting down, it's usually about 1.5 to 2 times the amount of time it takes to finish a lap. Once that timer reaches 0, or the last person crosses the finish line, that's when SR stops counting, results are finalized, and the countdown changes to 15 minutes until the session ends."
"Totally different schedules - C class is all oval besides two weeks, B class is primarily road but with I think 5 ovals a season

EDIT: And per posts below there will be other differences starting next season"
"It's being revamped for next season 

Fixed will be all ovals

Open will be 5 ovals, 7 roads

Open Fixed will be same as Open but close to 15 minutes

IndyCar Tour will be 75% or 100% distance races following the real life schedule as close as possible"
"In addition to what the other person says, the Fixed series has much better participation. That may change though since iRacing is bringing back its Indycar special event series and open often provides a better opportunity to practice for those races. Although the fixed series will always be more popular just because it's the only way to consistently race open wheel oval."
"As mentioned in here, it's all different starting next season. C fixed Oval will be 12 ovals. B Open/Fixed will run the same schedule with Open at 0:00 for about 45 + minutes and fixed at 1:15 with a 15 minute race. 

Maybe I'm naïve, but I really think those 15 min road fixed races are going to draw some people in. Hope I'm right."
The OPEN setup races are longer and require the driver to turn at least 1 lap on both tire compounds.  (Road races only)
"> open fixed

This doesn’t make any sense"
"Really hope this new agreement they have includes scanning the rest of their regular tracks. St. Pete, Toronto, Nashville and Portland would be awesome to race. They can keep the new Detroit though."
IIT has been redposted on the forums to be 100% length!
Fixed should be 25-30 min. I’m personally going to stay away from 15 min. Shorter race might draw more people in but I think that’ll come with a trade off of race quality while 30 min would hit a sweet spot 
"Portland apparently thinks they're worth more than they are. After the bit of racing boom during COVID, their licence fee is high. Else I'm sure we'd have it given NASCAR goes there too. 

The rest will take years if they do come because they can only be scanned while the track is built and then production on a track is like a year."
"Gosh Debbie Downer over here. 

I'm aware it takes time. But it certainly wasn't going to happen without a new indycar deal in place. Now there's a chance."
"There was a chance for most of those tracks before iRacing lost the licence too, with Portland being possible all the time. 

Portland unfortunately thinks they're a FIA grade 1 circuit and is asking for an insane licensing fee. "
Weird that rf2 has it. Did they get it before Portland got a big head?
Yes. One of the guys who worked licensing at s297 talked about it on the forums a while back
"If you have more than 2 drivers, you can easily work stints around people sleeping, we did it with 3 people and at 20:00CET i came off and returned at 04:00 leaving one of our guys to go sleep until 11:00 then and the other guy joined us late so he could rest before hand! Honestly you shouldn’t be becoming ill from doing these events, get an excel file plan who drives when and you will all feel good enough to be able to see the checkered"
"This is exactly why i like to have 2 drivers on at any time during the race. In my case I had finished my final stint and stayed up exhausted having only napped 1 hour since race start and nearing hour 21 of the race. 
Halfway through the next drivers stint his pc crashed entireley. Luckily the dc just resulted in a tow and not a wreck. So I hopped in to keep us going. He was luckily able to get his shit fixed by the time i ran the fuel out and I was able to get back out, and than our finish driver got on so I could sleep. But i can only imagine the time we wouldve lost if he was in there solo when it happened"
He became physically unable or ill for reasons unrelated to the event. And the stints were planned ahead of time and it left us no real option with 4 stints left and 2 drivers. But I get your point. Originally I was supposed to have from 12am EST to 5AM EST off which would’ve have gave me enough time to sleep. And same with our other driver who ran with me till the end. He was about 2 hours into his break when he was called in. It’s not that we didn’t sleep at all there was just no meaningful amount due to the fact we had to work our schedule for the 7am start around people’s obligations on Saturday. I got my rest now and I’m feeling great. Even better knowing we pulled it off with the cards we were dealt.
"Ah ok that makes sense, its a great feeling knowing you finished the day after! The day you finish the race is like bye im going to sleep fuck this game"
"If you can't find the driver it's because of their permissions or they've never logged into the forums.   


You're not doing anything wrong, there just isn't an intuitive way to send messages between one another in iRacing, whether this is by design or its just behind is beyond me."
"Web UI used to have it. Message other players.
Back in the days we still used that.

Personally, I feel the new UI was a step back... but who am I to judge."
"I know, it was handy especially if you wanted to apologize or commend someone or ask setup questions. It seemed a bit more friendly, I adopted the new UI pretty early on, when it was well in beta still and completely optional and it really doesn't feel like they've made any steps forward with the new UI at all."
Not that I'm aware of since podiumpapers shut down
It was shut down a little while ago unfortunately
"Its a supposed to be a sim and I don't know about gt3 but this definitely happens on big tracks like Daytona teammates or strangers there's a time to work together and a time to fight. 

If the cars can handle running like that in real life they have to be able to do it in the sim."
I never get the point that someone did not want to bumpdraft but take a chance at the outside on T1 and both loss about a second per lap instead of bumpdraft and gain around a second a lap.
"https://youtu.be/sWamt2jw_FE?si=80eouHQfflBqBZFb

It is very realistic."
"As long as both are the same class I don’t mind, it’s also a lot harder to do than people think especially for 900+laps. We had a gtp3 push a gt4 for multiple laps in Daytona couple weeks ago that I did report since that is just wrong imo."
"They were doing a draft, not a bump draft. This different thing but both are allowed.

Draft it's when you drive as close as possible to the car in front without touching, as close you drive as quicker you and the car in front run. This increases air speed on top of both cars and decrease air density in front of front car, as result air opposition on front end front car less and front car have higher maximum speed.


A bump draft it's when you hit the car in front, this you can do on a straight, banking you easily spin the car in front. Bump draft it's like better version of draft.

We have a side draft... But it's tactics against car in front.

All types of drafts are used in real-life NASCAR on superspeedways. Totally allowed in iRacing and not a silly thing. Practicing this you will create advantages in race, this make you faster.

On Nascar on superspeedways if we haven't friend on race, we trying to find person or few person with who we can collaborate all race long against less cooperative people, make gap and only on last laps start to fight for a win."
"I remember in MX-5 Cup before the real 24h (since that’s a support series) they warned the drivers to not bumpdraft so much and hard anymore, great fun"
"Yeah that makes sense, as long as it allowed irl it shouldn’t be banned in iracing. Honestly didn’t know it is done irl as well."
"If you're asking why someone would overtake, I do it because you're infield is slow as fuck and you're using the draft as a crutch. Daytona pisses me off because people will go hard defensive around the infield and then expect you to push them around the oval. I always start in the back so I deal with this often. One race this guy was almost in dead last and would block me around the infield, and then kept asking me to push around the oval. Just out of spite I threw the race so I could drive on the outside of him every time while we slowly lost the pack in front of us. Every lap he would start yelling on the oval since I wouldn't push him. 

Moral of the story, if someone is faster in the infield, let them by and try to ride their draft to push them. Don't except the faster guy to sit behind you and push you."
Gtp3?
They were bump drafting. The car behind was pushing the front car.
"What are you on about, of course they were bump drafting 🤣"
"https://youtu.be/lZBqXn87nZc?si=oMnxCYkw_4_49iM-
They have done it even in formula cars!"
"Slower cars it does happen IRL for sure. Even at the local track our spec Miata guys will push each other. 

A gt3 car on the banks of Daytona, I honestly don't know. In Nascar it makes the back end of the front car very light and can cause a wreck."
Guessing they meant LMP3
"Bump draft it's when you touch car in front, I so many laps, and didn't see contacts. They drive close to each other but without contacting. Or I miss contacts, can you show, please, with time code?"
"That makes sense, what is with this sub and downvoting? I was just genuinely curious but all my posts here get downvoted. Is this a Reddit rule I am not familiar with ?"
Oh ok thanks that’s also what I thought
"Literally any moment I opened the Redline stream they were bump drafting (so with contact) on the oval parts. Sometimes it was even laughable how hard (as in speed difference) Max was bumping the other one. Even a couple moments I felt like could also have ended in a spin.

So either you or I have been watching a whole other race/stream compared to everyone else I guess."
Nah it’s just Reddit. People get downvote happy if they don’t think your topic is interesting or they don’t like your question / disagree with you.
This sub is the domain of toxic gatekeepers and know-it-alls.
MV was doing it almost all the time.
"It looks like nearly everyone slowed down, nice job sneaking through"
Stuff is weird.  I raced GT4 yesterday and was in the middle split (3 total splits).  The number of incidents in the middle split was insignificant compared to the incidents of the top split.
Is this on the blue guy for basically pitting himself?
"This is the best feeling in the world.  Not only are you in the lead, your closest competitors are eliminated and the next person on the road behind you was severely delayed."
I don’t even slow for yellows IRL unless it’s a blind corner or there is an actual danger on/near track
People don't slow down because the guy behind them will just steal their place. Nobody wants to give up positions for free.
Does looks that way I suppose. Everyone in the chat was griping about it lol.
"It was great lmao the guy in probably would have been racing me the whole race for the win. But they both were done for and I had a 10 second gap to p2 by the end. 

Even then I’m still staring at my mirrors every time he gains .1 lmao"
Right. There should be a penalty for passing under yellow. But I can imagine that being a tough system to let ai handle
"Overall victory! Managed to lead 75% of the race and kept it entirely accident free which got us the result in the end. First ever time winning a 24 hour race, absolutely buzzing"
Getting DQ’d because one of our teammates thought they could race on multiple teams
"Was in a split with Tony Kanaan and Thomas Ronhaar so that was pretty cool by itself. Started ~~P7~~ P9 in the LMP2, survived lap 1, 3 wide throughout turn 1 and 3 and 5, managed to get P6 after 2 stints of battling. Then forgot to go in after my 3rd lol.

Raced all the way back from dead last to P6. Very little incidents, traffic was great. 9.5/10"
"Started 14th, no major incidents or any repairs, and we finished 3rd in the Caddy!!"
Team did absolutely fantastic. We had the consistency and pace for an easy race win. I had faster pace then every other GT3 (low SOF). Had a slight hiccup with internet so had to climb back up. I decided to do a long stint to get us back into the lead then let my awesome teammates bring her home. I caught the leader and went for a stupid move in the bus stop and his BMW knocked my paper weight Ferrari into the nether realm with 3 hours left in the race. 13 years of iracing and I know not to ever make a move in the bus stop especially when you have the pace to pass anywhere else. Gutted about I let the team down. Finished P10
"Me and my buddies are slow so we were bottom split with a team of clear smurfs lapping the entire field, including 2nd about 4 times. Woke up this morning to see they go their win stripped and dropped to last lmaoo. We finished 12th and had a great time."
"Got punted out of the lead in the first split, most of you have already seen what happened in the second. One day we will win this race"
"That’s cool, gotta get into doing these endurance races. Sounds like a blast"
"We started in the pits in GT3. Got to P1 in a couple of hours. 

Somewhere around the 4th hour a GTP was passing us near the pit entrance on the outside. Then they decided that they forgot to pit and just steered into us in their desperate attempt to pit  (they wouldn't have made the entrance regardless which somehow makes it worse in my mind). Their driver was very apologetic for the rest of the race so I forgive him.

Anyway we grinded it out and finished P2 in the end."
Brake pedal disconnected while leading our class. Never had an issue with my moza pedals till today
"It was 3/4 drivers first special event. My first endurance ever. Qualified 8th, early damage, down to 23rd, fought back and took home 6th. Never done anything like it. Awesome team started off as strangers. The real prize was the friendships we made along the way. Most fun I've had from a kitchen chair screwed into a few 2*4s"
OP please protest the team with the guy who was tanking iRating. Not only can they invalidate their result but they can suspend that driver and any other drivers on their IP address (hint hint)
"GT3 killed us when we were 5th in GTP, ended up finishing 11th 🥲"
"LMP2 Victory! Start was a bit rough, been punted into a spin and was last of the non lap 1 pitters. Fought back to p3 in the first 3 stops. Afterwards we just gained more and more and eventually won by 2 laps even though the P2 guys where freaking fast.First ever special event win and we are chuffed now time for a drink!

Edit: P2 guys had more bad luck they where p6 and 5 laps behind when we gained P1!"
"Lame Sheep Racing had 3 teams: P3 overall, P10 overall and P11 in GT3 class. All teams we entered managed to finish the race which is a great result for a team dedicated to low iRating drivers and beginners in endurance racing!"
"My pops and I duoed our first 24hr, we had participated at Fuji and Nurburgring for our first endurance races this year.

We started 28th today in the GT3 and finished 15th!  Pretty excited overall"
Wrecked at hour 12 running in P3 with only like a 10x. Got smacked by a prototype who owns the road while we were exiting the pits. Put us 10 laps down.
"Won GTP in our split after an early mistake put us down a lap, and despite an impressive effort from backmarker GTPs and all the LMP2s to ruin it.

Hats off to the GT3 drivers we raced with. I don't know how you put up with this shit and treat others as nicely as you did us."
"Took overall lead about 2 hours in and led until getting hit by an LMP2 that spun and didn’t hold their brakes a few hours later. Came out P11 5 laps down, ended up P5 4 laps down. Pretty frustrating because we had really good pace for most of the race, but such is endurance racing sometimes. At least we finished lol. First timeslot, third split"
"First time doing a 24h for me and my teammate!
The race was amazing, first lap really clean and everyone played it calm, it was great to see everyone driving safe and not dive bombing at turn 1


Lap 74 made a little mistake at turn 4 and crashed against the wall at ~100 km/h which resulted in... Absolute nothing, didn't lost top speed and the car was the same as always. Had 1:50 min of optionals but nothing else.

Lap 215 lost the back of the car and crashed at the chicane (drifted to the left at the entry, saw like 3-4 cars having the same issue later on the race), and again, nothing happened, 2 mins of optionals. 

Lap (I don't remember) someone lost it at turn 1 and couldn't avoid him, I was already turning and didn't react in time (I also was really tired), I gave him a little kiss at his left door, got 6 mins of repairs +3min optionals

Lap 352 my teammate lost it at the exit of turn 6 and crashed against the wall, and again, just 2mins of repairs. For some reason the 296 was solid as a tank.

We started p24 and finished p8!

Got promoted to A class 4.99!"
Started P9. dropped a few places on the first laps. Then we got it right and everyone did well. Finished first in our split. BMW GT3
[Mine turned into the Fallujah 24](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx9Py11ilSYYCaWfWekwzBlfdO8rCjMYun?si=jbHIDYRQRI5I4OdZ)
"Finished the race which was the team goal/expectation. Fairly wide range in ratings so we were racing in a split faster than our average pace.  GT3 drivers were mostly well behaved though, not much drama overall I think in our split. 

Had fun for the first D24 in the books for myself. "
"Car 1 finished 2nd, despite on the final lap getting wrecked into head on by a driver who finished and drove past turn 1 to drive the track backwards. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) Protest was filed.  


Car 2 finished 16th. Started 24th, drove up to 4th before getting wiped out into turn 1. 12 minutes of damage. Clawed back from 13th to 7th, driver swap and as soon as he pulls out of the pits has power issues with his computer which causes his steering wheel to cut out and goes head on into the wall. 7 minutes of damage. With only 5 hours left we had no time to mount a comeback.  


Everyone on both cars drove a solid race, just a lot of bad luck for team 2."
"Pretty ok. Started 21st in gtp, made our way to 11th in our pokey little bmw, the only one in our split. Had some really unfortunate disconnects middle of the night (thanks sky) and a game crash but kept it pretty clean. Not too shabby"
"If it was the 19hrs of Daytona we would have had a podium, but we ended up in a mess at the bus stop, and dropped us down to finish 12th. Still had a blast , my team are usually a bunch of dirt racers, so we are pleased with our result nonetheless"
"We finished P3 in GT3 while our sister car claimed P2 in the same split!!  We had nothing for the class winner though, they kept it too clean the whole way, but still, as good as a result as we could hope for without actually winning it!"
"My team finished P4. We had a pretty competitive split. Battled for P4 until the last lap. The car in P5 got the strategy wrong and ran out of fuel on the 2nd to last lap and had to back way off. Looking back at it, looks like they pitted right as the pit window opened and didn’t account for the race going an extra lap."
"Surprisingly good! Started P17 in GTP in a 1.8k~ SOF split, few little incidents and spins, plus my computer shutting itself off mid pitstop with no one ready to take over, but we managed P5 overall!"
"P4 overall, -19. Started p10 and slowly worked our way up. Goal was to just finish better than -77 last year. Was getting tailed by p5s fastest driver (in the slowest and was finishing) and he binned it with 20 to go."
"Pretty well, only some people in gtp need to understand that when a gt3 is fully committed for a corner, you should not send it up the inside from a 100 meters back. Was quite tight at some times. And dont hate on a gt3 in either voice hat or regular chat when it doesnt get out of the way, it is no f1"
"One of our cars got a DQ because one of our team members who committed to joining never showed up. 

Is there a way to kick a driver from a team mid race? We had 6 of 7 do their time, and if we were just a 6 man team we would have still met driving requirements with the same stints without any changes. "
"Got caught in a four car nose to tail crash on the warmup before the start line, lost a few laps instantly with repairs. Still finished, great experience. I'm trashed."
We started P10 on GT3 got spun by someone early and went to the back of the field. Managed to get the car to P2 and only 2 laps down. I was handed the car and managed to flip the car in T1. We still clawed back everything we could and finished in P6 with it being a majority of ours first enduro
"Couldn't have been better. I don't think we were lower than P8 at any point. Won the race by 6 laps. 

Winning Daytona was the #1 goal I set for myself when I got into sim racing. I kind of assumed I'd never get it. Don't know what to do with myself frankly."
Please do protest the driver who was tanking
Went ok
Got wrecked out of the 12 gmt and then joined the 16 gmt and won it in gt3
Started P15 and got P2 in the IMSA 1.9k SOF
"Were 9th of 49 GT3. Then I went to sleep after my stints and the next driver binned the car at the bus stop. 40 minute repair and P31, which we are ended with. Was like 8 hours before the end."
"Running the imsa races this week has tanked my SR to almost put me out of A and sent my IRating from ~1.1k to ~700..

I will be running back to GT4 with my tail between my legs"
"my wheel rim ran out of batteries (yes, it runs on a battery, not rechargeable) so i had to improvise, and i rebound a few buttons to my button box and switched to my sequential shifter

i did 275 laps total, probably 150-175 with the sequential stick, in a Porsche 963"
"Fought from last place on the GT3 field and got to 2nd place at around the 19 hour mark. Kept it there with a good gap down to p3 until the 22 hour mark. Got pushed into the wall by an LMP by a move that even his own team mate seemed to think was idiotic. Ended p5...

This was in a 5.2k GT3 sof."
"Went fine. Was running top 5, and then went to sleep. Came back to the car in 19th...all in good fun though. The GTP's were actually well behaved, even our low split."
"Not good, finished 18th, but I had 0x for my 121 laps."
"Drove 24h Solo in VR. Made it, 701 laps. finished p8 =\] Feeels gooooood"
"Our first attempt ended after 12 laps. 

Just finished timeslot 4 for a second attempt... P2 in LMP2 with minimal mistakes, no repairs etc for a change. P1 a suspiciously quick 9 laps ahead...frustrating but a great result nontheless."
"Was my first 24. Been on iRacing for 11 years doing ovals, I just started road racing 2 weeks ago. We ran GT3. Out of a team of 5, we had one ringer who was consistently in the 45’s and low 46’s. Me and another teammate were in the 46s-47s. And 2 others were around the 47s-50s. But we were all either wrecked or got wrecked at some point. Still finished P16 and it was a lot of fun."
"Got punted by a GTP while we was running in second on our 3rd stint, had 40 minutes of repairs, then ended up finishing p11 33 minutes behind p1, it kind of sucks but we was the quickest gt3 car on track pretty much the entire race"
"Up to p5 after about 7 hours. Should’ve been around p8 but my teammates were absolute morons and took out 3 ppl in front of us. We were vVv Racing Americans, so if we took anyone out that’s reading this I’m still very sorry. Then the same guy that took 3 guys ahead of us out binned it into the wall which I guess u could say is karma for killing half the field. Stuck it out to the end 22 laps down in p14. Definitely not our best 24hr race."
"P6, if not for a shunt into t1 from p2 we would have won the race by a lap or two. 14 minutes of repairs and clawed our way from p10 back. Good 5-6 minutes in the pits because of impatient GTPs. Overall super happy because it was the first special event for everyone in the team.

There was one GTP in our split who sent it into every corner trying to overtake people, ended up getting 217x. Race almost ended by them multiple times. And its not even the highest. Highest was 225x. 

We did well, 4 drivers 120x, almost taken out by the 217x gtp with 5 mins to go"
"Made it to P3 in the LMP2s about an hour in, then a random DC at around three hours in put us 3 laps down. 

We grinded like mad back up to P3, when a GTP decided to send it up the inside of an LMP2 in T1 while we were on that LMP2’s outside. 6 minutes of damage. 

We grinded like mad back up to P3 and with 1.5hrs left, my graphics suddenly locked up and I just drove it into the wall head first in the second horseshoe, ending our race. 

Muh emotions. We had the outright pace between our four drivers that we would’ve absolutely had the win if not for the DC or the GTP crash. Kudos to the winners for managing to make it the whole way though, it ain’t about raw pace at all."
after trying to get someone to drive with me for 5years for  the daytona 24 i found some friends that had time and we failed the first time slot and killed the car beyond repair but lucky we were able to use the second one and got p5 in gtp
"If getting taken out in a 1 hr race boils my blood, I couldn’t imagine being taken out in a 24 hour race."
P2 and no major incidents.
"I was managing/crew chief for 3 teams (I haven't actually driven in iracing for over a year so I'm rusty). It was one of the guys first endurance, he didn't know you should really take some of the optional repairs, did the 10 mins required drove straight out to crash within 30 seconds."
A Barbie car with 328 incident points killed us in the first 8 hours. We gave up.
Had one of the cleanest races our team has ever had. Still finished outside the top 5. Any other endurance race we've done a race as clean as what we did would have gotten us the win. Oh well. Still proud we kept it clean.
"Running gt3 at p2 25 seconds behind leader we got wrecked by lmp p14 (whatever it was it was low, next position laps in front of him, previous position laps behind him). coming out of turn 2 we left plenty of space on right for him while going to left side as well, he could not bother to move his wheel few degrees to go around until it was 100% sure that there will be hit. Most likely to also to make is seem ""accidental"" in case of protest... I'm pretty sure he was fully aware protest will do nothing (if anyone if watching them) so he was wrecking people left and right by going through them...

 That was less than 10 minutes before finish... after finally being scolded by multiple people for doing that to us and other teams from both classes he outright told us to fuck off..."
Went well. I accidentally spun into the bus stop at about hour 13 but that only dropped us from 2nd to 4th. We recovered to 2nd but a gtp hit us from behind in turn 1 with 20 to go and 8 minutes of repairs later we finished p6
"Our race was nothing short of amazing. Started 5th place in GTD (Friday 5pm slot, 6th split). Battled another team with their off sequence pit strat until we were able to come within 6 second of lapping them and then we stretched fuel to finally lap them. After that we had the pace to lap 2nd by five laps and then just brought it home. Finally after 4 years of trying, we brought the Rolex home!"
"Overall win, without many incidents except a lapped car spun in front of us in the busstop, worked our way back to the front through the night, got back into lead lap with 6h to go and regained the lead with 1h30min to go"
"My team were doing. Very well for the first few hours, fitting for P1/2/3 LMP2, came out the pit lane got collected with twenty minutes of damage, recovered to P9 but close to P8"
"We had some mishaps early on in the race.  We started P2 in the 963 GTP, and made our way up to P2.  As the sun set, a GTP spun directly into our rear quarter on the entry to the oval.  Resulted in 6 minutes of damage.  Fell back to P14.  Worked all night putting pace down, and was P4 when the sun rose.  We finished P3!  My team did great, never give up."
"GTP in split 2, was saving an extra lap of fuel running 15th, strategy was starting to come to us as we were nearly a pit stop ahead when the engine blew up hour 9.  Total bummer"
"We got hit with 7 hours to go.  Went in for the meatball.  Got told we would still have major wheel damage.  Tested tge car. It was fucked so had to retire 😪.  The car that hit us had zero damage 🤷  then to top it off, we got disqualified because we didn't meet driver requirements......  we couldn't finish the race thank you iRacing 🤔"
"GTP here… we were leading the race by almost 2 mins 6 hours in… another GTP multiple laps down raced us to the point of slowing us down 3 seconds a lap, driving overly defensive for no reason,  eventually shoving us into an unsuspecting LMP2… 6 mins repairs. We’re now 4 laps down… we battle back to almost the lead lap and get rear ended by and LMP2 who locked up following us into west horseshoe. Another 2 mins required. Now we’re 3 laps down and fight back to within a lap of the leader with 6 hours to go… (We can easily win) We saved enough fuel to skip and entire pitstop and then… and LMP2 disregarded us to its inside reentering the speedway, turning us into the wall… now we’re 7 laps down. Fought back to 8th place 5 laps down. 

All 4 of our team drivers were in the top 6 in average time etc… such a shitty result when we had the pace to win by multiple laps. 

We were in the first split with LMP2’s. Heartbreaking."
Tyler Johnson19 iykyk
"P3 in the LMP2 in our split! It was a very lonely race, none of the LMP2s were on the same lap by about 4 hours in, and although we got doored by the menace that was the #11 GT3 car as we exited the pits (they had multiple incidents with GTPs and LMP2s) we just kept on rolling round! 

One of our drivers centre monitors failed at the start (not driving) so he drove min distance (3 stints) on VR with no practice, that was impressive!"
Do you sign up for these events on iracing home page? I'm guessing some of these you need a team? My next question would be is how do you find a team? My friends do not have iracing. Hell most don't even know how to PC game. Lol
managed to somehow get into a GT3 only feild. ran up to 11th before teammated pc crashed while I was at the gym. by the time it was fixed and he was in the car we were 26th overally 2 laps down. we drove up to 16th and had a crash with a barbie liveried porsche who blamed us. 20 mins of repairs later we were p26 6 laps down from p25 and 3 laps between every car past then. we drove up to p24 with 6 laps to the car behind us. with an hour to go the barbie porsche struck again and intentionally wrecked us. thankfully no damage and a solid p24 after my first daytona 34. 3 drivers on a single team is a hard race but it was so much fun. had a crippling headache after lmao
"We had 2 GTP cars racing in 2 different splits.
Finished:
P1 and P2.  
Turned out to be quite the battle to the end.  I got to drive the P2 car across the finish line and we were only 2 seconds ahead of P3 which we overtook in the last 20mins of racing.  Had to pit with 2 laps to go."
I couldn’t make the 24 unfortunately. Had been practicing for a month and then some family emergency came up and I had to bow out. Hope everyone had a great race though!
Race was fine but was tapped into the wall by terrible gtp drivers. Honestly they didn’t give a fuck about us.. just yeeted us in the wall!
Not me but my dad drove it and the got fucked by lmdh cars constantly
"Not me because I couldn’t take part this year, but my teammates did great! GTP, started 20th then had an incident in the bus stop during the first stint that dropped them down to last. They rallied like hell and made their way all the way up to 2nd. P1 received a post race DQ so they got the win in the end! Couldn’t be happier for them."
Congratulations!
Congratulations that’s amazing!
Congrats man. I told my guys if we managed to win I’d probably end up with a noise complaint from the neighbors lol
That’s gotta feel incredible! Congrats!
Yikes
"Bruh, I mean this doesn’t even make sense"
I didn’t even know it was possible to do that? I thought you can only register for one race at that time
Like on a second account?
[deleted]
Ugh that sucks! I guess you could as long as that teammate does his fair share right?
"We got DQed as well, except our driver was listed as crew in one team and driver in the other. Correctly joined as driver into the official practice session, then suddenly was crew as iRacing changed to the race. 

Contacted iRacing and was told there was nothing they could do, even though he never acted as crew. Apparently this is only an issue when both teams are in the same session, but it seems odd that it is not something that can be undone (I can get with drivers as it affects SOF but crew?) when caught immediately.

Anyway, all drivers still raced (we just swapped accounts) even though we knew the DQ would happen at the end. Everybody still has a great time and we finished P2 in class until the inevitable DQ."
Hi Nym
We were in the same split. Lmp2 as well. P8. If not for 13min repairs thanks to a gtp that later on quit we'd have podium. But great experience overall.
"Same split, we finished 2nd in the GTP class. Shoutout to the TouringProSeries Gentlemen's Club (we are all old). It was an insane split for got the GTP's. Pace was insane."
"LMP2 gang! Doing GT3s this season but next season I want to race only in the P2, it’s such a good car."
My team was in that split. Pretty funny listening to comms at the end with everyone looking at and talking about the smurfing evidence from their driver and him (the smurf) getting super/hyper offended about the accusation.
"We were there.

""Hey man why do you have no laps run and a last place finish in all these starts this week?""

""Kinda weird a 400 irating driver would run a setup shop....""

Bro started saying bc he's a volunteer firefighter he gets to quit races whenever he wants and shit"
"Basically the same happened in ours, they where lapping everyone up to 5th pretty regularly but got knocked to 3rd with a few hours to go"
"Yeah we had the same, 1500 SOF, the leaders team consisted of a 5k driver, along with a sub 1k driver lmao"
"One day it’ll happen, one day. Did get a very entertaining clip from lap 1 of our race of the leader taking themselves, P2 and P3 out in one go."
Ooof yeah I saw that 💀
Did you see third split gt3 leader get killed as well?
"They really really are, I don’t do much iRacing day to day anymore but the special events are amazing. Great fun with my friends at great tracks. I find it a lot of fun having a target each stint and pushing for it."
"I also had a never-before-seen ‘mechanical issue’. (irl tech issue) My graphics suddenly started having micro-lockups towards the last few hours. Put it in the wall while expecting to cruise to a hard-fought podium. 

That’s just what endurance racing is all about though."
"I had this happen in the real world once, made for a very exiting time!"
That’s such a shame :( how did you finish?
"I’m sure we all have similar stories from starting, I love iRacing special events they are such a fun event to do with friends and even strangers. 

You always think you’ll be doing your stint and then disconnecting until the next one but I always end up staying connected watching the race like it’s TV, working out positions with pit stops, what we have to do to get where, what times competing drivers are putting in, I really love them they’re such a fun team event."
You know this isn’t the iracing forum?
Congratulations on your first special event win! Hoping to join you soon (be nice to me Bathurst)
"That sucks, did you at least have a good crack at chasing up the field?"
As a GT3 it’s actually a lot of fun battling with faster cars squeezing through. As long as it’s all respectful and no silly sends/blocks it really adds to the experience
Glad you enjoyed your first 24!
Congratulations on your win from a fellow BMW GT3
"Damn that’s terrible, it’s definitely worth reaching out to iRacing staff"
Whoa that’s an odd one
"Welcome to the 24h club, hope you join us again"
Classic sky internet :/
"Ah shame, but glad you guys enjoyed it anyway"
"Man, what a way to lose a position after 24hrs. My teammate and I both had our spotters stop working (iRacing default, couldn’t figure out why as sound devices where right and it worked on the first 2 laps) so he ran out of fuel once right after the bus stop and had to tow."
Do (cheekily) love watching a driver I’m battling bin it
We sleeping good tonight
"Hahaha flipped it in T1, what did you do?!"
"Congratulations, bask in the glory"
what is tanking?
"This happened in our bottom split. I forget which team it was, but everyone in the session knew what they did. They got called out on it and ultimately got wrecked out I think."
"The winner of our split got DQ'd after the fact, it seems, for sandbagging/tanking their iRating."
"Ah that sucks, basically my race last year :/"
"Hey, finishing a 24 hour race is an accomplishment in itself. Keep your head up!"
It’s about the personal victories with endurance racing clean stints is a win of its own
"Wowee, how’re your eyes feeling? I love VR but 24 hours would definitely give me a headache"
"It is a shame that these events do seem to be filled with smurfs and the like, when we were briefly challenging for the lead it just felt really crappy knowing that we didn’t really have a chance."
"Glad you enjoyed it, give some of the other endurance races a crack, Bathurst next is very fun (or miserable, depends how you drive!)"
"Ouch. That does suck, where did you come out the pits? Did you have a good charge through the field at least?"
"I’m glad you finally got to give it a go, will you do anymore events this year?"
"Surprisingly it’s a bit easier to handle, you’ve got so much time ahead of you to rectify mistakes and most the time you will come out on the same lap or near the same lap as a few people to fight for position. A 1 hour race is basically done if you have to repair, an endurance race is just getting started!"
I’ll admit to doing that once so don’t hate on him too hard 🫣
Honestly our entire split was exceptionally clean. I watched most of the crashes in the race and 90% were 1 car crashing on its own. And even then very few
"Man that sucks, it’s a lot of effort but you can definitely protest if you have proof of him doing it repeatedly"
"These events pop up on the series list like any other race. [Events Calendar](https://www.iracing.com/special-events/). You can definitely find teammates on here, some iRacing discords or on the forums there’s lots of people looking for a team"
"No, same account"
Don’t know
"No, you must withdraw from first which is DQ"
It sucks
Nice
Sup Gordon
"Also in that Split in the LMP2, pace was a bit too much for us though unfortunately."
Was a great field of GTP apart from 2 or 3 that loved to divebomb last second
Lmp here too. We finished second!!
"Absolutely loved the ending with everyone calling out their bs. Nice when a community comes together lol. I know the 3 other guys on my team all protested, one of them clipped the part where the smurf said go ahead and protest, iracing isn't gonna do shit anyway and sent that in too lmao."
"Oh, you guys were in our split then. Wolfpack here, we finished third but got handed the second place."
[deleted]
"Yeah, I always break up my time in sim to prevent memory issues. We're you logged in the whole time"
I had brand new issues with JRT stuttering and freezing up along with screen tears which was really fun. Luckily it didn't cause too many driving issues.
"16th. It's racing, I'll live. Daytona is dead, long live Bathurst"
"Not really lol, I think we only gained from p18 to p15. My stints were all early."
Thanks man! Congrats to your team for that P4!
"Not my first (even won Nords 2018) but first time finally having things align for Daytona. tried last year but the team just fell apart at the last minute. 

Glad to have found a good group of folks though to run more enduros with."
Yup I imagine they probably just let Crew Chief take care of it as soon as the window opened. I worked out the last stop since I was out of the car and chose to have him run to about 12 laps remaining so we didn’t take tires and got a splash. I set him up with 2 extra laps of fuel and that was enough. We were P4 at the time and when we came out of the pitlane we were right next to P5. We got ahead of them due to them getting a slow down at the bus stop and then defended for about 20 minutes until the 2nd to last lap where they backed way off and had to do the last lap very slowly to make the finish. It would have been close over the line for sure but they got the fuel strategy wrong.
Well as I entered the turn and got in the brakes had the car decide to step out and I couldn't get it slowed before we hit the barrier and whacked it. Had the full Ricky Bobby moment as I flew in the air.
"Getting bad results on purpose, usually by joining a race and just withdrawing after its official.


Some people do this to lower their irating so that they get put into a lower split for special events and can cruise to victory. 


Those people are just lying to themselves and destroying other people's chance of a fair and decent race. 


Always report people that tank their rating on purpose. "
Signing up for races without joining  them or immediately forfeiting so your elo (iRating) goes down
Intentionally losing races to drop your rating
Purposely gaming the IR system by losing races on purpose to drop your IR significantly to be in a lower split for a big race such as this one
"It's all good :). No headache, no strain on the eyes. I would say nothing out of the ordinary. Was a lot of fun"
There does always seem to be at least one every time we do a special event. 1.1k irating driver doing 1:34s and 35s on this occasion. Doesn't seem genuine.
"Came out in 23rd, full push for the remainder was a great charge through when i had my nap we was 16th when i woke up we was p13 which we would have finished but cars crashed ahead so got some freebies"
i have planed to do every special road event and some oval ones that i can and my mates have time for
There was a guy in one of my practice rooms that was telling me about a discord where you could get car setups for free. I didn't catch the name before it put us in different rooms. I have discord now but don't know how to find iracing rooms though?
What a genius
This is false
"Jus workin. I didn’t even know Jacob was doing that, y’all were killing it though. Sucks about the dq"
"Yeah top 5 was out of our reach on pace too, still good racing overall!"
"Congrats boys. We moved up to P7 in the end, had pace for a podium but got meatballed by the clown shows a couple times lol"
"If you’re looking for a team, Fendi Racing is usually taking in new people! Great group of people over there. https://discord.gg/TGmtZ6wb"
Yeah for the last 8+ hours. Good to know that restarting will help. Hoping for better luck at Sebring in March with all the stuff I’ve learned!
"I’m very excited for Bathurst, see you on track"
lol why did you have to trigger me like that. I hadn’t looked at the schedule to remind myself what’s next. Last years Bathurst we were determined to run the McLaren which of course is a temperamental and neurotic car on the limit. Then I got covid. Drove it with a fever in VR. My temperature registered 106 in between stints. I thought I was doing okay but then simply looked at  turn 4 “the cutting” wrong and put it into the wall. Every one of my teammates had a crash in that race.
"In my split 1.1k SOF me and my teammate both 1300. The team that led 90% of the race had a driver who was 2700, 1100, 1200, 700. The 700 driver is actually a 1400 but he tanked his rating. I’m very happy they didn’t win."
"As much as I would’ve loved to have battled for the lead the entire racing, making 24 positions mostly on track is an unbeaten feeling. Chipping away at a car ahead over an hour while skipping through traffic is so much fun"
Which? You can join two races at the same time or if a driver withdraws it DQs the team? The second is published on iRacing. How do you join a second race without withdrawing?
It wasn’t Jacob that was the issue. He wasn’t on our team
"Yeah I do every 6 hours and it's manageable

Also, no Bathurst?"
"Cool, my team will be running the ford for the lulz"
"For like 16/18 hours its fun, you have that feeling of being quick un lapping your self and gaining on cars. The last 8 hours its not fun you realise the cars you are chasing you have no chance of catching unless they crash so it just becomes repetitive"
"Clicking withdraw doesn't give you a DQ. You can withdraw, do another race, then join back in the race you've withdrawn. Don't create lies please."
"Oh yeah, sorry. I read Justin in the discord and read Jacob"
HELL YEAH that’s a great idea.
"You’re not wrong, luckily we were in a position where that last 8 hours we had every chance of reaching 2nd. Quickest on track after the smurf had finished his stints"
"Please don't be an ass and call someone a liar when they might just be mistaken.  I am trying find where I read this but in my searching I can't find it other than another reddit post where someone said this, so I might just be spreading mis-information."
All good
I'm not going to apologise. Spreading random info without people knowing what is true  is annoying as fuck. I made a fair argument and even said please so I don't see how you can think I am the asshole.
Everyone makes mistakes.  I really researched this a lot and felt it was true.  Saying someone is a liar is rude when they made an honest mistake.  I was trying to be helpful. You are right and it was not helpful since I believe you that it is wrong (although I can't find proof either way).
"And I don't need an apology, just realize you make mistakes too and it does not make you a liar. So maybe just say to someone else ""please don't spread mis-information.""  This would be the correct way to say it.  Even spreading lies would be better than creating them, since I did not create this information, I found it else where...  And that person probably was just mistaken also."
I wonder who that imsail oulbabe is
"Congrats, my team were in a very similar boat, last year’s Daytona went bad and then Petite le mans wasn’t much better, all to bring home a p4 this year. It hurt though as P3 was wrecked out and we were just a lap away from taking 3rd"
"I feel you! We were running P4 by halfway but my PC shut off mid pitstop with no one ready to jump in, cost us two laps and dropped us to P7

Then later P3 got into a wreck and lost 5 laps, which had we not lost the two during the night wouldve put us within striking distance of the podium. But overall, very happy with our race"
Assuming it’s a subsequent offense.
"That is not a week, ruining someones 24 hours of work will atlease be a month ban if not, it will prob be a lifetime ban"
Doesn't look intentional to me. Doesn't advance position by riding the apron. Loses it transitioning from the apron to the banking. Just a bonehead.
"Lol, its ferrari fixed, calm down Karen"
Perhaps the sharp wheel input to the right will change your mind
"oh really, didnt know that considering the damage, sorry"
It looks like the car bobbles as the left side moves over the racing surface/apron line and he corrected causing it to snap. Riding the apron like that really puts heat into the tires.
"Wrong, try again.. [https://streamable.com/hc937t](https://streamable.com/hc937t)"
I think you found the driver who hit you. You can even hear in the main video the intentional wrecker is modulating throttle so he can time his *move* correctly.
"And now that you have more info to share, and why you wouldn't have done that first I don't know, I'll change my opinion. It does point out that a single video clip is not always definitive."
"Fortunately, I was an innocent bystander that heard the coms afterward, but definitely jumped at reporting this guy."
You forgot to tag it as a humble brag ;)
Have you noticed any benefits on road?
"I have a gamer pro, they add more immersion and are way helpful than anything else on my rig. What effects do you enable? Do you use LFE or simhub?"
"Is there a way in iRacing to have 2 separate inputs for speakers?

Like one for under pedal plate for wheel slip/lock and abs, and one under chair for engine shift/road effect? Or is that just in simhub?

Cheers"
I use the Buttkicker Pro behind my seat and it makes a huge difference. I'm thinking about adding another one under my pedal plate.
What exactly do you feel in oval? Tire slip? And then you try to not overdo it?
Not that much difference on road for me. But it definitely improves the immersion factor. It feels weird to drive without it now.
"I use LFE. Feel free to try my settings:

Main volume: 0
Game audio: -40
Impact: -3
Engine: -9
Gear: -1
Rev limiter: -15
Rumble strip: -10
Wheel slip: +3
Road texture: -7"
Same here combined with a FFB wheelbase.
I believe this can only be done with SimHub
"Yes, you answered your own question :)"
"Good to know, cheers! I'm around your level rn/trying to work out what upgrades to make to move the needle in terms or irating/skill level. Of course I should probably just be better instead of blaming my equipment, but still😅😂"
Thanks i really appreciate it.
I’ll try it too
"So it has some slight rumble when gripping on the road but when loosing grip it will rumble less? Can you tell where the grip is lost, front / back?"
"My brother sent me this video to get me into a buttkicker. Super informative, and all the parts are available on Amazon,  and some at your local hardware store.

[here](https://youtu.be/Bum_d35XQ6k?si=C2zKenKp_yrLQbqc)"
"It’s the other way around. It rumbles more when you lose grip. When you’re underdriving the car you feel less vibrations. You‘ll get the feeling after a few laps.

I think you need more than one buttkicker to tell where you lose grip. I only own one and placed it directly under my seat."
"Followed this guide, too. I really like the way Lorenzo explains all of this."
"See now I just need to have this 😅😭. Thanks for the video though, super helpful :)."
Sounds kind of wrong.
0.9k GTP moment
[Here's](https://youtu.be/eD6BHUh-QBI) the TV angle
What was that car doing ?
"I hope you protest this, 268 fucking laps down and doesn't know the track or being malicious, they need a nim slap"
Something similar happened to me during the last lap with a gt3 that had crossed the finish line and was celebrating.
"That split was absolutely wild. GT3 had a SOF of 1.7k, GTP had an SOF of 997. Went about as well as you would expect."
The Daytona 500 isn’t for a few weeks.  Were they confused on which turn one to use?
Wheel disconnect / monitor blank? I hope??
"I did protest this after posting it to Reddit, but have not heard back from them yet. Maybe the stewards are unusually busy after the Daytona 24h?"
"All in all we had a good race, P4 on GT3!"
"That’s my initial thought. Surely something disconnected here? Right? Right????? Right???????? 

I had my pedals disconnect once at SPA in the SF23. It was honestly terrifying lol"
"Protests are for intentional wrecks and rules violations, not mistakes"
Looks like a dumb mistake by the 20. Protests aren’t for simple wrecks like this though. Don’t protest unless it is 100% intentional.
No protest there. It was stupid but not intentional.
"This is what happens on superspeedways, especially in short races without cautions. Not worth protesting or even being that angry about since it’s the nature of the beast."
That is a very normal way wrecks start at the restrictor plate tracks
No. Please explain which rule you would be protesting.
"Ok, thanks all for the comments! That’s why I wanted to check.. and appreciate the explanation of a true protest. Still frustrating. Haha 

Appreciate this community!"
"The 20 did less wrong than the purple truck, neither did enough to protest. It’s an unranked Dega race, that’s basically the point of them"
No......
Gotcha.. still learning everything. Appreciate the explanation!
Glad someone else saw the 16 throw a couple of blocks and drift up the track.
Eh it was ranked.. lost safety rating.. but that’s ok! Learning all the ends and outs.. appreciate the response!
Pretty much everything is in the Sporting Code. Doesn't take too long to read.
Didnt you set your Quest 3 to 72 hz in Oculus? Are you sure it's 90hz in there?
"There are distinct render pipelines on graphics cards and if you use the same pipeline it can be restricted to the lowest refresh.  If you unplug your monitor does VR hit 90?  If so, look at your graphics card documentation and move your monitor to another socket/pipeline."
Your Quest refresh rate will be limited by the Oculus desktop software. Fix it there. 
"Thanks :) I guess I got caught up that my monitor happened to be 72Hz so assumed it was that, not knowing it was the default Quest rr too!"

"I use VRS for telemetry, super useful and free for the global mazdas. They've got a 1:20.6 as their data pack time I believe."
"You want to trail brake a lot more into T1 and T4, both of them you can brake pretty hard into the apex, and only come off the brake once you can go back onto throttle, rather than having some time where you are just coasting. After t5, you should be able to go completely flat through to the final turn, no lift off needed if you get the right line. In the final corner, also trail brake further into the corner, be less aggressive on the brake pressure initially, and tail it off slower and more smoothly, again aiming to only get off the brake once you can get back on throttle. 

One side note, I notice you're braking at 100% into t1, you ideally only want to hit around 80% to avoid abs kicking in, which is slower than braking at the threshold of grip. 

Credentials: best lap 1:20.7x, optimum lap 1:20.6x"
"You're not rotating the car with the brakes.

Suellio to the rescue!

[https://youtu.be/dVfCvMcdMxU?si=WujBc-D14kS9X74N](https://youtu.be/dVfCvMcdMxU?si=WujBc-D14kS9X74N)"
"You’re coming into 3 too early/sharp, use more of the outside. 

After turn 9, get to the middle of the road so you’re straight on to brake into 10.

Open up more coming out of 10.

This is all IRL advice I’ve received from a coach at SP."
"It'll sound counter productive, but practice coming off the throttle and coasting before hitting the brakes. 
The aim in these sorta of cars is to carry as much speed as possible through the corner. If you jump straight on the brakes like a high power formula car you end up over slowing the car. 
Coming off the throttle earlier and coasting before hitting the brakes will give you more time to think about how much braking is required and trail brake into the corner a lot easier.
Once you have that nailed you can then move the braking points further to reduce the coast time"
"I managed to get a 1:20:994  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_wtWnal0wCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wtWnal0wCI) 


80% break pressure didn't seem to slow down the car faster. Maybe because I'm downshifting too fast. And my trail braking isn't much better."
I feel I'm taking same lines and same braking points and getting a 1:22. U are lucky to get what u av 😂😂
"My optimal lap time is 1:21.080 so even if I get everything right I'm still not below 1:21  


Is it just my line? Is it trailbraking? Where am I losing so much time?"
"Less brake(Never push 100% in iRacing), early downshift, use about 5-10% brake when start turning. iRacing is all about braking"
"Cool, I'll check it out! "
"I think you've got your turn numbers wrong. There is no braking for turn 4 which is the right hander ""the chute"". T5 is the slow left hander.  Summit and VIR are similar that turn 2 isn't really a turn so basically there's turn 1 and then turn 3."
"Never noticed I'm wasn't using 100% throttle lol.


In the last corner when you're breaking; are you trying to ""skid""/rotate around the corner, or do you want grip on all wheels? 


And I'll try to relearn how to brake. I thought 100% was the most effective way of doing it"
Also ABS when abused will overheat the tires and cause less grip and understeer for a few turns.

"Was it a coach or an instructor? Big difference. I instruct occasionally at Summit both for NASA and for private exotic track days and the only people I ever tell to be middle track between 9 and 10 are super fast exotics as they almost catch air going under the bridge and the car will still be light as the track cuts to the right (I also tell brand new HPDE1 drivers to be more middle track for a similar reason. You want them focusing on braking straight as a safety measure, not as a speed measure). A car like the Mx-5 you want to be track left to get the better angle into T10 and also to avoid slow traffic that may be pitting on the other side of the crest. No spotter irl."
I think this might be the next step
Did you look at your telemetry in Popometer or Track Titan? Did you watch a track guide? 
"I find when I use maybe 95% break pressure into turn 1 I slow down the most. Are you recommending using less not to slow down faster, but to keep tyres fresh? Or can you actually slow down faster with less break pressure?"
Yea it’s great since the Global MX5 data pack is free.
"Cheers for correcting me, didn't look at the track map tbh😅."
"It could be that your throttle deadzone isn't quite right, and you've got your foot flat to the floor but iracing isn't detecting 100%. 

Generally speaking you're always looking for a little bit of ""skid""/rotation into the corners, known as slip angle. Essentially, you want the maximum slip angle to occur right as you're about to get back on throttle, which is why you want to trail brake further into the corner, if that makes sense. 

I thought too for the longest time that 100% was the best way, was shocked when I found out it wasn't 😂. Out of curiosity, what pedals are you running?"
"You need to learn trail braking. You're braking really hard and then instantly releasing. 

Your line is fine, aggressive on the throttle, all that stuff is OK, but your brake technique needs a lot of work. T3 and the final corner are especially noteworthy, you're braking hard and then releasing before even turning in."
"I was testing a spec racer ford at the time - it was the coach who runs the cars with that advice.

I found the grass on the left coming to 10 to come in quickly, so the middle of the road and breaking straighter found me a much better line and stronger exit to the front straight."
"I watched some track guides to learn the track, but most of the times are similar to my own. The one with 1:20 is from a year ago and perhaps there has been some physics updates since then. But now I found [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaGpXMPngYo) which is kind of recent. There's some slight differences in temps, humidity and wind, so maybe I should be faster.. or slower.   


I've never watched any telemetry"
"The thing is not how slow down the most but pass turn faster isn't ?

Any car move not only left and right it move up and down at the braking and acceleration. If u push brake till the block ur car get whole the weight on the front tires and if u try turn in this situation u'll cross out the corner with understeer like a plow. If u'll try turn and push gas pedal right after braking u'll lose ur rear tire cause whole the weight still in front and there's no grip in the rear. If we'll watch ur T1 now we can break it for 3 stages - braking, turning, accelerating ? When u brake u don't turn ur wheel, then u turning without touch any pedals and then finally u could accelerate and end ur turn.

But what if i say that u can turning with braking and accelerating if u'll use car weight right ?  
  
Just try in own session use less brake and early downshift and start turning at 5-10% of brake pedal and then somewhere around apex stop braking and give a bit acceleration and push it more with turning wheel back to 0°.  
U could think that speed will be so high to turn but in this case u can start turning a bit earlier and kinda smooth an angle."
I only remember because it's thrown me for a loop about 100 times describing those two tracks by turn numbers.
"I'm running the sr-p lite pedals. Got them in a moza r5 bundle.


Generally speaking, is a ""coasting period"" in a corner a sign that you're losing time? Should you either be on the brake or on the throttle at all times? "
"Telemetry is key to improve. Without it, you probably aren't really analyzing how you drive and comparing it to people who are faster. That's why professional race teams use telemetry.


Popometer and track titan both have free offerings and are worth spending time on. "
"Go sign up to Garage61, run your laps and then compare your telemetry to a huge number of people in your target IR etc. 

VRS is decent for MX5 as its free, but Garage61 is free for every car!"
"Ah okay, in terms of the braking, a good way to set up the pedals is so that you can press down as firmly as you'd want to, and hit 80% pressure. It should ideally be pretty hard/impossible to hit 100%. Boosted media I think had a good video on this that explains this better than I ever could. 

Generally speaking I'd say yeah, the way I see it if you have time to coast, then you could have broke later, and trailed more instead of coasting, with the added benefit of more rotation/slip through the corner. Having said that I'd base it more on the VRS telemetry than anything I'm saying. If you look at the throttle and brake traces for a given hotlap and they're coasting, it's safe to say that you should he coasting."
"I feel like adjusting your pedals to not ever be able to do 100% is going to lead to some bad habits, especially in real life."
"I can't comment on how it influences real life racing, but certainly in terms of sim racing, it does help to have a heavier brake pedal, as this enables more precision in trail braking, and prevents abs kicking in under heavy braking zones. I defer to the boosted media video on the topic for exactly how to set it up though."
Do you have a picture / reference / link?
"I have one from AliExpress, I use it for streaming but just make macros for it (eg. Button 1 = CTRL, SHIFT, B, then assign that to iRacing)"
Link?
"i just picked one up, havent gotten as far as setting it up properly. 

the software it comes with is janky as hell but thankfully it bakes in the settings onto the board so i plan on setting each key to F13 > F24 (alt / ctrl / shift modifiers for layers) then managing the actual macros etc via autohotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com)

for the 3 knobs not really sure keys i'll bind them to (again will just look for 'unused' things(

when it comes down to what i'll actually have them do? no idea, probs chat macros and pit stuff, maybe some replay buttons on one of the other layers. my simcore wheel has all the buttons/dials i could need for actual driving stuff though so it was always going to be for extras

one of the dials could be FFB strength as i keep forgetting to set it per car hah.

the software that it came with sucked but if you're lucky yours might work with VIA (https://www.caniusevia.com)... mine does not"
"and sorry, that doesnt reaallly help you that much directly.

because the computer treats it the same as any other keyboard, you can start by configuring the 12key thing to match whatever you already have configured for your regular keybooard in iracing (or the defaults)

and silly as it sounds, go into a couple of races actively paying attention to things you wish could just be a single button press, and then work backwards from there to see if you can configure it straight up in iracing, or if there's a more complex route to go 

(also doesnt have to just be iracing specific, like i plan on having a volume knob just for spotify so i can turn down my 'car stereo' after practise, another button to auto open all my support apps like simhub/truedrive/ioverlay'"
Schedule looks good. Can do a few of the rounds. Doing drops?
"No drops rounds this season. This is an exhibition type series, to work out any bugs in our broadcasting and setup. Drop are likely in our next season."
"I don't know why I love the idea of will power getting shunted and rage quitting like ""fuck this stupid game"""
Will and Christian probably took each other out lol
You wont need to tell them. Once Redbull see this and hire you theyll put the press release out
When you start beating their laptimes
You always know it really is Will because that dude is full on wreckers or checkers. Never seen a faster guy until he wrecks than Will.
"Im sem, Will was p2 when he got taken out by a back marker and Christian retired cause he was bored when will died…"
"You have already sent the text, correct?

In all seriousness, well done"
How the hell are so many people taking this post at face value LMAO.
Since they both disconnected and 2 secs a lap faster than you I wouldn’t recommend it
"I was also in this split. It's pretty cool that we were up against real world pro drivers, but aside from that the F3 series is so competitive and fun."
Immediately! Call the boss now and assert absolute dominance
"When Will Power calls you a piece of crap after the race, you are ready to begin your journey."
TBH every iracing member has beaten will power
WHEN YOUR BOSS/COMPANY IS YOUR OFFICIAL SPONSOR IS WHEN YOU TELL HIM!!
"I get Edoardo Leo in a lot of my F3 races, he's got like a 9k irating and a world champion title. Always feel special when I finish higher than him"
"I mean.. I beat Oliver Solberg in RBR and in EA WRC.. 

Went to work today.. that overtime money is legit..."
When you feel like being homeless.
Hahah look at Will and Christians lap times.  They were the fastest.  Looks like they got taken out.  Still if frame this and hang it on the wall
You’re 2 seconds off his pace.  Don’t get too excited 😂.  Not his fault some sub 1000iRating guy divebombed and took him out.
Well they wrecked out so. But. You can say you beat them still
Did they crash while ahead of you?. Will power is going to come for you on Reddit now.
"I agree. Quit today. You seem to be so full of yourself,  the company will benefit.  And we don't really give a shit."
"sure you beat them,but your pace is still seconds off so go practicemore"
That Lee Zeltwanger guy is dominating my Super Formula races.
Haha i beat Lundgaard in mazdas just the other day
When you were making more money racing than your works for six months in a row
That’s interesting that they race fixed
Send me money and I'll take you in my team's LMP3....
Ngl Power and Lundgaard are both very accident prone on Iracing
Right away
"I raced with the man yesterday as well, can now say that I've technically shared a podium with Will Power"
"Imagine being some random Indycar driver and all of a sudden you have these 5k, 6k iracing aliens right next to you in rl. Racing the same car you are. The same track you are. That most blow your mind."
and then filing a protest lmfao
Hey I do that all the time
"I saw it happen to James Hinchcliffe right it front of me at Road America lap 1 T5. No recovering from those crashes with damage, so not worth your time."
I love that he doesn't even have an A license
I don’t know who that is - but I love that his name is Will Power. And he didn’t finish.
I don't know what happened to Lundgaard but I think Will Power got wrecked by a backmarker lol
and Lee was collateral
does a champion get crowned based on lap times?  I don't think so!!
in his last ten he's either podium'd or wrecked lmao
And getting angry at it! 😂
I did it too once and i dont even play iRacing

Because I'll be traveling so much to go to all my races?
"Maybe I'm 2 seconds off but I see that I'm 7 laps ahead so how do you explain that??  Exactly, because I'm better :)"
"To finish first, first you must finish."
Fuck you

No need. I'm already better than indycar drivers. I have peaked.
">quit my job

Yeah no that sounds like racing to ne actually lmao"
And flipping off his in home security camera.
"Two-time Indycar Series champion, 1-time Indy 500 winner, all-time leader in poles and two wins from being 4th all-time in wins"
Max Verstappen would argue yes.
"Haha, true"
"Lets start with actually affording a ride in any championship at the lowest level lol.   Sim racing will help you get better yes.  But it wont make you a pro driver.  Even the best sim racer who has never raced a car with others on track said sim racer will be fighting real sensations of real world racing.    The constant dance around possible death or serious injury.  Or maybe the fear of totaling the track car you have spent the past 4 years building ect.    Lots of factors play in.   Doing it in a SIM doesnt mean you will do it IRL.    But it will help and you will be more intuned with certain aspects.   Like the racing line.   Trail braking.    Getting or giving a tow in a draft pack ect.    But it wont certify you to be a pro driver lol.  

Flex the money in your wallet and maybe you can race in Indy.   Till then do what the rest of us do and just hug your pillow and cry yourself to sleep at night.   And at day hop in the rig and become the ""internet verstappen"".  

All jokes aside.   Pretty cool bragging rights!"
"No, because you’re quitting a paying job."
This guy never heard of the tortoise vs the hare smh
Legit
Will Buxton is that you?
Massively. Needs to get a fucking grip.
peaked by being unfunny on reddit. what a sad story
Later making a compilation video of that
Well done. Quit your job tonight.
Charles Leclerc would disagree
"Don't worry, after sponsors see this race result, I'll have no problem affording anything I could possibly want in the world"
I don’t know why honesty gets canceled with down votes.
Pretty sure Red Bull pays its drivers though
I think they need to add the waaaambulance series to iracing specifically for you
Double birds.
"I always play the Dutch National Anthem on Saturday when Charles gets pole, just for shits and giggles lmao"
Because OP is obviously kidding.
Because people dont like hearing the truth.  I really dont know.   Bad take maybe?   Also dont care.  If i was worried about my comment getting downvoted I wouldnt have posted it to begin with.   🤷 happy sim racing.
"So, not you?"
"damn, bro got all his alt accounts out huh"
"Do note that this isn't the same as the Whambulance, which puts the boom boom into your heart, sends your soul sky high when their loving starts."
Yes me because they saw this post and are begging me to come race for them now
No we can just observe when someone’s being an unnecessary prick.
Aww shit
"Maybe when you grow up, you can be just like OP."
"Man, I’m hoping."
Was this the 24? If so thats even MORE impressive.
"No of course not, just a Ferrari challenge race."
"Totally agree finding league is a pain. It's usually up to the league to find you. I solely use Reddit to find leagues because using the 'League Directory' on iRacing is a waste of time.

I started my first ever Porsche Cup league 3 weeks ago and we're 3 rounds in. It runs Sunday 8pm GMT and follows the official iRacing schedule, European league so very little to no desync issues, fun and varied race format, open setup, full stewarding team, free to enter and great organisation. We're 3 rounds in and the attendance has averaged about 35 cars per race and would highly recommend, the racing is top class.

Here's the link to the Discord:

[https://discord.gg/Z3uMqRQJ](https://discord.gg/Z3uMqRQJ)"
"Apex racing league is cool. It is paid, but you get some prizes back if finish top 3, and it’s well organised in general."
Very much appreciated. Hope I can sign up mid season that is perfect race time for me
I had come across apex but it wasn’t particularly cheap I thought and not sure I’ll enjoy it much more than standard races to make it worthwhile. I don’t think I will ever be top 3 pace either😂
Nice one. There's 2 drop rounds as well so being 3 races in you will have only technically missed 1 round
"Well, I lost interest in standard races after a season in the league. The idea that you prepare for the next track during the whole week, on the same car, with the same people, just like in real life racing, that's why I like sim racing, so for me it's perfect.

&#x200B;

And the money, I see it as a good thing, people why paid money are showing their commitment. And it makes it feel more ""serious"" or something. Also, their streams are of very good quality, which also adds to a feeling of ""this is a real competition"".

&#x200B;

As for ""never in top 3"" - they have 3 divisions, pro, pro/am and am, separated by iRating.  Top 3 in all divisions results in prizes.

&#x200B;

Anyway, it sounds like I am their PR manager now  :-) but I just enjoyed my experience with them."
"Not a concern for me, I don’t expect to be competing for the championship 😂"
"Never mind you, what the fuck is the other moron doing? He shouldn't be allowed anywhere near iRacing again

Report tf out of him"
"I would first A - protest that. It looks deliberate. Did you have an incident earlier in race.l? 

B. These are the 5% of incidents that are impossible to avoid so don’t beat yourself up over this one.

The only advice I can give is maybe look further down the road it will help you generally avoid more trouble but this guy going backwards needs a ban."
"Sometimes in order to get to good, fun, happy parts of a hobby, you have to suffer through some pretty shitty beginnings. 

Skiing you’ll fall a lot

Lifting weights you’ll hurt yourself 

Cooking you’ll burn some stuff 

Unfortunately with racing, sometimes you do everything right and still crash. 

Just the way things go, it gets better"
Definitely file a protest. Get that POS off iRacing please!!!!!
"He held his line, clearly your fault. /s"
"I reported a guy today because he rejoined the track without any care, crashed into me and then ""retaliated"" when I pulled over to tow. On a practice session! I can understand getting mad in a race, but practice?


That guy had like 400 iRating. I hope he gets banned."
You have 7 days to protest/report. Do. Not. Wait.
"This is very rare, even in rookies."
"I'd love to see their POV because it looks like they could have been pushed or bumped off the track and then just let Jesus take the wheel. 

Truly that's just shit luck.  Remember though that even a/b/c drivers are running in that series. I'm in the 1200-1400 splits depending on the day and usually only see 2-3 rookies per race. Eventually you'll get to a good spot where the lobbies are consistently decent. Or at least not quite as chaotic."
Any chance to see the other guys POV from before he went off track until this crash?
"i LOLed pretty hard, GG"
"I cant believe no one has suggest mapping ""torpedo tracking on/off"" to a button yet."
"Report it, thats a good ban"
What in the world
Report and move on to the next race
This made me lol
"To be fair you could have left him a little more space, there was clearly an opening and he went for it.  

Not really. Just report it and get the cunt slapped.  "
"Protest protest protest , that was deliberate as fuck"
"I don't know this track at all but I've been told that the grass in this game has a reputation for being unreasonably slippery.

This really seems like a one in a thousand event and also it's really really funny to watch.

Take a breath and get back in there OP you won't be in rookies forever"
Just wait until you try Formula 4! I haven't made it past Turn 1 without getting exploded and towed on Spa this week.
"I can't stop laughing. This is one of the most iRacing things I've ever seen. God, the people driving that game, goodness."

"I'm tempted to ask why he did this?   Only cause I would assume this was caused by some sort of provocation.   Most likely a bad start and mayhem the usual.   It seems you were the one they chose to target.  Theirs a reason more than likely.

On the other hand.   I have been hearing more and more 12 and under kids screaming into their mics.   Have also seen some pretty bad driving and just feel bad for those who are getting scammed into paying 13+ a month to just get pissed and do this lol.     

I'm always looking at my relatives.   When I see 2 cars up ahead get extremely slow and lose pace on the relative then i know something is off and I should be ready and extremely cautious as to whats infront of me in the distance.    Same goes for behind me.   If approaching a heavy braking zone and the guy behind is just borrowing in at me then I usually pump the brakes and veer to avoid a bump and run or rear end collision.   Always love making some feel even worse when they miss a intention wreck on you and only hurt their own race.    Makes the enjoyment factor a 10/10.   

Shit will happen.  Rookies is a blast.   Dont try to escape too quickly or you will be a track hazard in d class.  And become the very thing you hate.   Stay in rookies and learn.   Dont worry about SR."
"You raced rookie class, that's what you did wrong"
maybe don't do rookies then? You have morons using 3 month free subs and just dicking off all the time. Best to just get out as fast as possible
"I've been racing AI bc no one races what I like. 

They wreck you viciously. I set a 50 lap event and I got beat and bumped until finally lap 39 I got pic'd and wrecked. Reset. Wrecked lap 19. Reset. Wrecked lap 11. They're starting to hit me earlier and earlier lol"
wait till you get to F4
Is that the same guy who got lost on Road Atlanta?
Immediate rage quit
"Real simulator, real life consequences. Idiots are by millions."
This is why I’m team Formula Vee
"Think of rookie class as a sort of junior high school for new drivers. It may be miserable and feel like it will never end, but it's absolutely necessary to isolate these people from the rest of society. 

Jean-Paul Sartre famously said that hell was other people. He was talking about rookie claas.

Have you tried time trials for raising your safety rating?"
"Protest it.  It looks like he missed the turn wide but not braking there is not acceptable. 

Man, what an absolute piss missile."
This happened to me on this track the other day. The guy that did it to me had been an iracing member for 9 years. I was like what?
"Report, he'll get banned"
"You’ve got wheel damage. 

Bro I can’t even imagine what you must have been thinking when this happened lmao"
"Protest. Also, like someone else said that while you couldnt have avoided this, its better to look a bit further down the track to see if theres any hazards"
"Coincidentally I saw someone griefing like this for the first time today too. It was just in a practice session at least, but he was just driving backwards on the track trying to hit people over and over for like 15 minutes. Fortunately he was terrible at it and super predictable so he never got me, but I definitely saw him get a few who probably didn't know he was doing it."
That’s next level.
BANZAII
"The only possible non-malicious explanation is that his wheel and pedal cut out. That's happened to me twice in practice and once in a race. Each time I've gone careening into a barrier. 


BUT if that happened  and i murdered someone you had better believe I would have come on the mic and chat immediately to apologize profusely. "
"At first, I was like damn, you got a chance for first, then blam"
"This is why i quit iracing, the game used to be fun but now 60% of users do this stuff. Leagues race once a week, not worth my time and money for that little racing time. Make iRacing great again!"
Protest
"These morons are driving around with G29s thinking this is hilarious, meanwhile the person they hit has a 20nm wheel and just fucked up their wrist. These kinds of people should be permanently banned from the service."
BAN
AYOOOOOO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
And did you do this in VR ? Lol I'd have a heart attack lmfaoooo
"""OC part of the blame is on you""-  iRacing shitty support instead developing a proper penalty system."
"It will die down. Lot of dumb ppl got sim setups for Xmas. Happens every year, you will eventually collect more rating and cars and tracks and price yourself out of these ppls lobbies. It's similar to the packed gyms after new years day."
Lmao he's playing in VR. Must be a big jump scared lol
If you protest that he will be banned I really hope you sent that to iracing
"Your fault , you should not be exactly on that place when the train passes . lol 

Do a  protest .

One month or two ago , one guy rammed 8 or 10 cars on a Ferrari challenge race , on a rolling start , 5 secs before the green light the guy puts full throttle and it was cars flying allover the place , 8 or 10 cars lollll .  Alot guys did the protest , i did too . The problem was a internet connection problem , he saw green light and our cars were not there for him , so he full throttled to continue his race , but we got the collisions . . . ."
"It's the rookie class, unfortunately.. you'll get away from those people soon enough."
"This happens far too often and iRacing does nothing about it because it makes you spend more time on the service, thus more money"
You definitely turned into him /s
Think we’re looking at a disconnect issue. They were going around that outside turn and continued going straight under the gas. Either it was intentional which hella of a spot to time it at or it was a disconnect/internet glitch and the car kept going and driver wasn’t even in it.
Report this to iracing and have this asshat removed from the service.
Maybe just leave a space next time 🙄
"I understand we’re racing, but I always have to give up a position or two the first corner in rookies to avoid getting wrecked by someone dive bombing. I’m just trying to be careful because I know that’ll move me up faster. My race plan is driving conservative and letting people wreck themselves."
I came off the track a couple times but nothing crazy as you can see I was holding 3rd place 8 laps into the race.
"I'm not familiar with this circuit at all, but if you pause at around 0:17, it looks like it could have been a very, very bad off? He's carrying a stupid amount of speed, though.

I'll reserve judgment until I see the offending cars full POV leading up to the incident, but its severe enough that yes, he should protest. Even if it wasn't intentional he should definitely be spoken to."

This is excellent and something good for all of us to remember. Thank you!
Golf...well actually nevermind
What a reply! Totally agree. Some people who join iRacing are legitimately bad apples. That’s why protesting exists OP. This guy is either getting a harsh warning or a ban ASAP.
Well said.
Bruh 😆
![gif](giphy|3oEjI105rmEC22CJFK|downsized)
how you even get to 400 iR is beyond me. That's just constantly being in the bottom 5% every single race
"If they made no attempt to keep from reentering the track going the wrong way, then it can be protested as an unsafe rejoin"
"iRacing grass has gotten way less slippery over the last couple of updates. A season ago it was too grippy, to the point where people would use it intentionally because it was actually better than the paved surfaces in certain cases. Now they've dialed it back, but it's still nothing near what it used to be."
"On this track, if you miss the right-hander into that section then this can happen. The driver had way too much speed (like, way way too much) and either went off on their own or was pushed off. 

Definitely negligence from the other driver, and definitely a rare occurrence."
What split are you usually in? My races have been fairly decent in Spa surprisingly.
I was in third this is lap 8 out of 10 so I was having a clean race except for clipping the grass a couple times
I have not. I'll give that a try. Any tips for time trials?
Bro I just reported this guy and he's been an active member for 4 years...
"Sounds like a you problem. This is super rare to have happen, or you are just an exaggerating clown"
Heyy DM mir mal bitte bin der mit dem du geschrieben hast die ganze Zeit
Buy the F4 and get away from Rookies.
"He missed a turn that does aim right back at the racing surface, but looks like instead of braking he just planted his right foot out of frustration and took someone with him. Bannable imo"
Yeah they completely missed the right handed which u turns back on itself. Rather than going straight across the field and rejoining in the right direction they rejoined against traffic.
Reserve judgment till u see evidence? You savage. What is wrong with you? Sir this is Reddit!             /s
"Yes, this RC version of Charlotte is part of the Roval and has a section that comes off the long infield straightaway. If you miss the corner going into that due to speed (and gross negligence, honestly) then you can definitely end up doing this."
"At least we don’t (usually) have physical pain from sim racing, only emotional 🥲"
Doesn’t matter. Rules apply in practice as well.
"Once saw a guy in an enduro with a single digit irating.

He was every bit as bad as that sounds."
"Some sort of disability, malfunctioning equipment, or an absolute refusal to learn how to race."
"I have no idea, I've never placed better than 7th, I gained IR in my last race somehow..."
You can literally see him steer into the guy full throttle. That’s not what happens here.
"I'm a noob so I'm in the 1.2-1.5k range. Just got my D license last week, Tsukuba track went really well for the most part."
No particular tips but week eight is Lime Rock Park without chicanes so you should be able to grind out a thousand incident free laps in your sleep.
"Direct head on impact doesn't happen a lot, but iRacing is no better than forza online or GT online anymore."
"Yeah, because f4 is a bastion of the highest driving standards... what a suggestion lol"
"The D Class Indy, USF2000, is a superior option for much cleaner racing. 

Hell I find rookies to be cleaner than F4"
"Dude, F4 is barely racing. It’s more like avoid every crash and you might get a podium"
Thats cute you think F4 will make him feel better haha
Someone stop him! He's being reasonable!
There is no way they the vee has enough speed that this could be an accident.   The guy either got bumped off or was frustrated and he kept his foot in it to crash someone.
Someone broke their wrist from the force feedback from a similar incident…
It was a joke…..lol I agree with OP
"From my experience the last few weeks my races in 1100-1300 irating on f4 have been Verstappen wannabe’s who don’t actually know their limit. 

My sub 1000 splits have been great races overall. Still have incidents but not nearly as many as the 1100-1300 range"
Im 1100-1300 range. Spa F4 has been pretty clean for me.
"It can be bad but higher speed/maneuverability of the F4 means it's theoretically easier to out-react idiots. Also rewards preparation quite a bit more, you can generally outqualify the idiocy with some preparation and care. That's my take anyway.

I've never had so much frustration in this hobby as I have driving in low speed (Miata, etc.) cars with rookies. Absolute torture."
"I literally got a podium (P2, even) in F4 at Watkins Glen after qualifying P17. My pace was actually that much slower than the field, but the winner and I were literally the only people not to crash. And this was top split."
"Those were FF1600s, but the point stands: too fast for a simple off track."
"Yeah hence usually lol

I’ve seen broken thumbs too"
I’ve definitely been blind sided like this at least once where it hurt my shoulder. Granted I already have some tendinitis there but holy shit it hurts when you don’t expect it and get the full brunt of it.
Ah. Sometimes I don’t get jokes. I fucking head my brain.
"He said rookie series, the FF1600 is a rookie car?  Either way, yes the other guy couldn't have ended up there unless he kept his foot in it and purposely drove across the track"
Ohhhh yeaaaahhhhh
Yeah i almost broke mine on the ovals… NASCAR doing NASCAR things
There's a rookie and a d class running for the ff
"I just double checked I had thought it was a D class car that had a fixed and open setup.  Seems weird for a rookie car, it's rather challenging to drive."
"I only drive open wheels and I find it (and maybe the skippy) the easiest. Feels like you can actually catch mistakes / correct / have a bit of a slide and keep the race going. 

The higher downforce cars are fun to lap but I find very hard to race. Feels like I'm either on pace OR binned in a barrier 🤷‍♂️"
"Why remove them, if there's enough slots for all gt3s to be included? The macca is super popular with the topsplit teams. The ford also has a community that races them exclusively, especially now with the resurgence of proto/gt"
"My split Bathurst 12 hours was won by a Ford GT last year. We raced last 24 hours of Spa with one and I did a GT3 league with one as well. It's still used, just not much. If iRacing retires another one of my GT3's I will riot."
The Mclaren is very good at Bathurst due to the elevation and turbo.
Why remove them when there is no replacement? It doesnt hurt anybody that these two are in the pool and the Macca is actually pretty strong on some tracks
"Why remove them if people still enjoy racing them, I would not mind if they added more ""outdated"" gt3s like the viper/bentley or return the z4."
"Basically, they keep increasing the maximum car models faster than they add GT3s."
$$
Why would they?
The problem with the Ford GT is that all the other cars have to get BOP nerfed to make the Ford even remotely competitive.
Isn't the protot/GT series using the gt2 as opposed to GT3?
"Oh ok, i didn't know people still racing them. Just asked this because they are super old"
It's not a real GT3 so I expect it to be replaced soon
The Viper would definitely be a cool one to run.
"I think they specifically stopped doing this last year or the year before for Bathurst. Despite that, a team did finish 2nd with it iirc."
"Yes, but it's the same car, just different homologation. You get them both for the same price"
"i think in the developer update where they announced a delay to rain they noted that in the coming seasons there would be ""replacements"" but they didn't specify which cars

i think the obvious GT3s to be replaced are the ford and the mclaren. the ford gt3 is a better car than people give it credit for (and you can use it in the proto GT challenge, best series on iracing)

probably the ford gt3 replacement is the mustang but it would also not surprise me in the slightest if they replaced it with the corvette gt3, considering they have the C8 GTE as well and the GT3 is similar"
Then we riot.
So they call the Ford GT3 car a GT2 in the PROTO GT series?
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
It has different performance and has a different rear wing but yeah basically the same car
"I remember reading about an endurance race someone put on, maybe the Majors Le Mans, that had a safety car when a secret number of incidents had been reached in the race. I always thought that was a great idea. "
Simple idea : tire set limits may add some strategy.
"I really like where your head is at with this. I don't know how far to go with it, blending reality with the sim, but there's definitely room to make a more engaging experience and up the realism. If there's a way to bring cautious without it turning into iPacing, that would be great. It'd be nice to bunch the pack up a bit, like real life. What I wouldn't want is constant pace laps because people can't keep it together."
Brake wear or damage would be nice. And being having to change brakes would make sense. They have to at least once irl. Maybe more suspension and engine fatigue. You have guys running quali laps for the whole race you'd think the engine or suspension would fail at some point. Especially through the bus stop. People just bounding through at some point a shock or a-arm would collapse. Saftey cars would be interesting. I'd say for multi car crashes It'd make sense. But the amount of crashes in online racing games would make that a chore. Rain would be the next great overhaul when it arrives.
The problem with FCY is that cautions breed cautions.
"Make smurfing against the sporting code.

I have done all major road events in the last 4 years, and there's always at least one team who has a 5K IR driver on a throw away account who runs 30-50% of the laps.

I get it, you want to win, but it's like lying on your golf handicap, and it ruins the experience for people who want to compete against a relatively comparable pool or drivers.

Fortunately, in this year's 24 split, the team who won had legit accounts and just ran a perfect race!"
I just want more solo endurance races.
"No idea what an implementation would look like, but if you could replicate the bronze, silver, gold/platinum system from endurance racing that could be pretty interesting. Lots of strategy at play there in real life."
I've been in endurance races with cautions. Please no.
"I have been saying for years for endurance races that it would be cool to have a random number of cautions thrown through the race randomly. There must be a way to have it scripted to be completely random. 
It would throw more strategy into these long races as well there would be more battling by keeping cars closer for restarts. Like a 24 hour event I would be okay with like 3 or 4 thrown at random. Could be spread out or even 2 within a couple laps. Not sure why they don't do it."
"How about properly splitting SoF in multiclass? My 24 split was 3.0k GTP, 3.7k (I think) GT3, 1.5k P217. Couldn't the classes have been filled better/fuller to match SoF, and put the lower SoF class in a split with a closer overall average?

Sorry, if that was confusingly worded, I'm on 1 1/2 hours of sleep from my race 😂"
There really wouldn't be a need for a safety car because the wrecked car would just teleport back to the pits. There's also no debris to clean up so once the car disappears there's no hazard. I'd say what we really need is some way to be able to slow people down coming into a wreck. Everybody blows through them and if you try to respect yellows or sometimes even simply try to find a safe route through a wreck you'll often get punished for it by the people behind you going full speed and steal a place from you because you did the right thing.
"My thought is less on FCY, and more on Slow zones/yellow flags. If a car crashes and tows, why not keep a yellow flag out until that car has been “towed” they don’t have to keep the car there just leave the flags up and actually enforce no passing under yellows or have a slow zone in that sector until car has towed."
"as someone who just did a league d24 in a league with safety cars: absolutely not. total chaos each restart, someone or multiple people died each time. it was massively stupid and not worth bunching the field up."
"Tyre limits - YES!  
FCY's - Dunno, I like the idea but the reality is not great.   
Rain - I fear that iRain is going to be a damp squib in that people will find it too difficult and avoid it. If it rains early in an enduro, I could see there being 6 cars left simply running laps."
"Go back to having tire strategy instead of free tire changes every stop.  


It's ridiculous to race 24 hours and get as few iR points as you get.  We finished fourth in class and the most any driver got was 15 points.

Brake wear/changes isn't a bad idea, but would be complicated to implement.  Also cumulative damage from things like slamming the curbs or even constantly over-revving the engine.

I really don't like FCYs, but I also realize that they are a big part of endurance racing.  I'm of two minds on that topic.

Rain often determines the results at Daytona and Le Mans.  The sooner we get quality rain simulation, the better these races will be."
"That’s a good one. I always thought maybe have the game throw one if someone tows, but make the game punish you more for towing, that way people don’t abuse it. That can still be flawed though."
"There's several leagues that do this. It's a good idea but then the wave bys and pit stops are all manual and take forever. It wouldn't be easy for iracing to implement an automated version but clearly it's possible since they do something similar with oval cautions and lucky dogs. 

It should definitely only be used in endurance races though. No one wants 15 mins of caution in a 45 minute sprint race."
There’s people who host their own special event with random safety cars. There’s also programs that will drop a safety car if there are xx amount of incident points accrued in a xx second window. So if 5 cars wreck there will be like 20x in 5 seconds throwing the flag
Yeah back before you could fuel and change tires simultaneously you at least had the decision of whether or not to multi-stint tires
Yes!
Absolutely this. Used to have more options in your bag of tricks for strategy before tires/fuel happened concurrently. Now all you've got is fuel strat. My GT3 team wrung out 2 extra laps per stint than the fastest cars on pace. Guess who finished 2nd in class because of fewer pit stops...  😏. The tire pitstop thing is a shame because we legit could have triple-stinted tires in the dark hours saving even more time. There is zero incentive to be kind to your tires this year at Daytona.
This is the simplest idea that would actually make endurances a lot more interesting
if the limit wasn't less than 15. it wouldnt matter much.
"I've done the Jimmy Broadbent Zolder race 2 years in a row now and yeah, road cautions people just lose their heads

I think in special events whilst awesome it would really lead to people driving into the back of others"
We have brake wear but it’s modeled as if you get new brakes at each pit
"1. Random number of yellows say 1-4 for 24 hour, 1-2 for 12 hour, 0-1 for 6 hour
2. Random time but cannot happen within 1 hour of the start, finish or another FCY
3. Always happen if weather changes to rain

Rules would be tough, but something like a simplified version of what majors does for the Majors 24."
"Not only that, there will be fights and arguments about when a yellow was or was not thrown. And how exactly will a FCY will trigger and then people will try to cheat it, etc etc. sounds like more of a headache than it’s worth."
"Yes, but I think the benefits outweigh the downsides. Strategy would be a legit thing instead of the 24-hr sprint races we have currently. It's all run for an hour, check fuel and tires, rinse and repeat until race is over."
"This.  Our split winner had 2 guys, with the same last name, one was 4k, the other was a C 1300 with 20 races (just getting to C).  The 1300 guy was running the same lap times as the 4k guy."
"Agreed. In the roar there was a guy in my split two seconds a lap quicker than anyone else. I looked it up he had like two races in the last few months. Of course he beat the brakes off all of us. 

He was coming up on me with maybe fifteen minutes to go and it was so tempting to push him off the track. I never do stuff like that, and didn’t, but damn did I want to. "
"We had a 0.8k driver in our split running high 31s/low 32s in GTP.
Absolute bullshit."
You can do imsa and vrs solo
There's a post in this sub today. Someone soloed (and won) in a prototype.
"It used to split based on IR like you describe and was changed because then you end up with a bunch of splits that have 1-5 cars of the less popular classes and everybody complained.
Imagine LMP2 this year for example."
"I think it has to be mostly random. Oval cautions are brutal in special events. Like the entire first hour can be pace laps. I would hate for endurance races to turn into that. 

The Bathhurst 12 at a lower split having a full course yellow every time someone towed to there was a big wreck would be the Bathhurst six hours at full speed and six hours of caution laps"
Lower splits would just be continuous safety car restarts until everyone was dead
"fuck wave bys, all they do is fuck up legitimate advantages gained, do it without them."
"Simultaneous fuel and tyres is the stupidest thing they have ever done. There is no endurance series on the planet that does that AFAIK, and IMSA and WEC 100% don't and never did."
"Well that's lame. We need warping, fade, glazing, flat spots, punctures, and slow leaks. And non of that auto fix at pitstops."
">Always happen if weather changes to rain


no, that defeats the entire point of strategy on when to pit for wets"
"I mean, yellows have been a thing on ovals forever and it doesn't really seem to be an issue. Sure, some people try to cheat it, but you protest that and move on, it's not a constant thing in my experience."
"Our split had one guy at 1300 who was running low 1:44s in GT3, he was the fastest most consistent driver in the field.

In his history, he has almost exclusively run ovals, and dirt road...

Clearly bought the account for the race. I think they finished 5th because of on track issue's, but it was still annoying trying to keep pace with them."
"I think they need more 60-120 minute races. That'd be right in the pocket. Long enough to try different pit strategies,  but not too long that its an absolute drain."
That old system never compared IR between classes which is what this person is asking for.
Most splits of the Indy 500 is just survive the nonstop yellows in the first 50 to 75 laps. Then the race begins.
Oh yeah that would be horrible.
"I think a random approach is the best way to avoid “iPacing”.  Something like 0-5 cautions in a given event, with the number and lap thrown to be determined by RNG.  That way, it’s enough to keep everyone on their toes, but not so much that it becomes a chore."
"Well it's based on imsa and they do wave bys. And the main reason is to avoid illegitimate advantages gained through cautions.

If you're half a lap ahead of the leader in multi class but then a caution comes out and you happen to get caught between the pace car and your leader, they just gained a massive advantage on you by now being only a few seconds behind you and potentially lapping you. And this just compounds with more cautions."
IMSA does which is why we do because it’s an IMSA sponsored event.
I agree it’s dumb but it was to replicate real life IMSA rules which recently changed to allow it
"I do not agree for non-driver related issues like random punctures or leaks : we already have that : iracing crash, internet down, wheels or pedals failures, etc."
I feel every weekend we should have 90 minute versions of any multiclass series
"i'm fine with the ess(former ilms) being basically replaced by imsa, but i do miss races being 1 hour instead of 45 etc"
The last one I did was nonstop cautions for an hour then green almost the entire race after. I was thinking if I did it again instead of worrying about finishing good I’ll just join 45 minutes late and catch the green flag runs
ive had a 3k SOF indy 500 go caution free the final 160ish laps. 1 caution at lap like 35. it was wild. the winner was the dude who pitted last. not due less time stopped but fresher tires.
"I think a threshold number of incident points in a sector within a certain time would be good. Two cars colliding wouldn't do it, but a pile up would."
"They don't have to be random. When there's a collision cars visibly lose bits and pieces. If you drive over them you risk a puncture. The same way they model marbles and gravel being dragged on track, they could model debris where an accident happened.


Same thing for leaks. Every time you damage your car there should be a chance of something leaking. Isn't that a thing in stock racing already? I remember my temps going high and blowing up my engine after hitting someone on the back."
"Very true, but I'm sure there's a lot of considerations regarding player count/popularity I'm missing. I'll have to check out the pilot sport challenge, I'd have no problem running a TCR. Been considering joining a league more and more as well."
I don't think that would work. It would encourage someone in a wreck to then include more people in the wreck to force a caution. Like by having a bad rejoin. If your car is already toast what do you care at that point?
I'm pretty sure iracing intended to simulate that with NDM debris. But they were so prone to netcode problems that they just dropped the idea. The first few weeks of NDM had collisions with ghost debris so now debris is non-contact.
Debris would be hard. Cool but I really don't know a game out there that has a persistent junk/stuff mechanic that is stable. Bumps with other cars or running wide would be easier. Or just pushing the tires to hard and blistering to the point of blowouts. Or excessive camber or toe that heats a part of the tire to the point of failure. Could also be a way to steer people away from running min/max setups.
"The way I would do it is by ""abstracting it"". When a collision happens, depending on the speeds, forces and stuff, I would add a graphic of non specific debris. Some random pieces of something that looks like carbon fiber, just as a visual indicator.


If you drive over that, you risk a puncture. The more ""dense"" it is, the higher the chance. It doesn't have to give you a x4 or interact at a physical level at all.


As people drives over it, it slowly clears. If it's on the driving line, send a safety car and make it disappear at a high rate. Just a couple of laps and it's cleared.


Also, it doesn't have to be on every series."
"I was in your split in the #4 PEG-R BMW GT3, you guys approached this the right way working with teams instead of against them. It was a pleasure to share the track with your team.

Sadly we were wiped out by an aggressive GTP pass from P3 with 4 hours to go after going through the wars to get back up there.

If you have a twitch/discord whatever that please send a link it's fun following other people's journey, we started last year at the Spa24 ourselves."
"I streamed ours on my twitch at Motto1834. I wasn't streaming my first two stints because didn't want to risk it having issues. I was the guy that had the lock up, slide, and went airborne in T1 about 8 hours in. In VR that was something else I'll tell you. Had a great race with y'all."
Was it the 17 Milwaukee GTP? Or the green 771? They’ve been the ones we had a problem with all race. Almost got taken out by the Milwaukee GTP with 5 mins to go
Did you manage to get that clip?
"I didn't see that one, may have been during my sleep time. Sounds painful though!"
"I think one of your team called them the Milwaukee Murder Machine at the end that made me laugh.

It's funny how every team has their heroes and villains, you were the former for us and the purple Driven GTP (forget team) was our main villain who brake checked us (cut across on the brakes after kink after our driver was already braking then blamed us for hitting them i.e. it's our fault a GT3 doesn't stop like a GTP at high speed?). Then they tried to intimidate us the next stint by swiping us and we were constantly diving out of their way to avoid race enders. Then I realised they were doing it to everyone and we weren't being targeted...

I kind of enjoy those interactions though and the story of the race, everyone has one I'm sure in someone's mind we were a menace too!"
Nope realized after I swapped over for the night back to moniter. During an update for iracing one of my settings changed and it doesn't ask me if I want to save the replay as I'm getting out anymore so I missed that gem
Yeah theres nothing you can do about incompetence unfortunately. I remember cutting off a purple GTP in my last triple stint like 5 times. So we’ll call it even lmao
Ah that sucks
"There was two purple Caddy's so who knows which one you cut off!

To be fair I think by the end of a 24hr you'll have had at least one disagreement with every car on track it's just understanding which ones are genuine misjudgements or mistakes and which are generally incompetent/dangerous/stupid. 

The results screen incident count is usually a good way to confirm your suspicions about specific teams and drivers!"
"Yes, but only for a week because my downstairs neighbor put a letter on my door saying it sounded like a truck driving over a bridge, so then I felt bad and sold them."
"More consistent I'd say? The biggest benefits for me are in being able to really feel how much curb I'm taking (or not), being able to feel when the car has lifted off the track (due to a bump), and having the tactile feedback to know when I may have downshifted too early and the car hasnt actually gone down a gear (obviously there's audio and visual cues for this, but not feeling the immediate ""thud"" tells me I missed my shift). "
No but I have Dayton BST1 and cheap amp and it’s totally more enjoyable with it. Also depends on how good your FFB is. I have VRS which is incredible and you feel so much that bass shaker is not needed to understand what is happening with the car.
"It's definitely helped me, the feedback you get on wheel slip during braking helped immensely this weekend in the Daytona 24h. I was able to ride the edge between ABS helping and ABS overhelping and slowing things down far easier than previously, I read outbraking pretty much all the gt3 cars and a number of the prototypes(who needed to step their game up, but still) into T1 and the horseshoes.

It's taken a couple months and probably 30-40 hours to get used to what it's telling me, but I highly recommend it.

I'm running off the iRacing source on a $25 USB amp and a Dayton bass driver."
"Not faster, no. My Buttkicker Pro is for immersion, feeling the road and curbs and my pedal reactors are for abs, slip and lock. Maybe those help with consistency but the BK is purely immersion. Driving without it feel very empty, though."
"If you’re an old school car racer it’s very helpful. 

If you’re new gen gamer type person then not so much."
"I don't think so,  I love them and they add a lot to the experience but I can turn them off and I am running at the same pace as with them on.

Turn down a lot of the sounds, make sure tire sounds are as high as they can go and get used to hearing that - when you are driving fast you can hear the tires, when you are not driving fast enough you will not hear them enough unless you are making mistakes..   The tire noise is the same kind of feedback that you will get from slip.

   edit - to add as i dont really run cars with abs but yes as mentioned above, knowing abs is kicking is is useful."
No. I thought it might but it's mostly just fun
"Yes. Running through SimHub where I can set frequencies and select which feedback I want. Being able to feel when you are close to the limit of adhesion and during braking is incredibly helpful. Also helps with immersion. 

For me, the single biggest area I can tell where it helps is Porsche curve at Le Mans. Knowing when you are near the limits and getting the feedback when coming through that section is very beneficial."
I wish I could figure out why the fuck I have a .5 second delay in my bass shakers. It absolutely ruins the experience.
"Currently racing in VR and have the BK2 and a pedal rumbler kit. The haptics definitely help with the things the wheel does not catch. It has made me a more consistent driver, not necessarily faster. That comes with time and practice."
"I have a buttkicker, a HF7 and a vibration on my pedals.  Faster?  Probably not but 100000x increased the immersion and fun.  There is no way I can race without it now.  Best sim upgrade ever."
"All of this really depends on how it’s mounted. You can adjust the frequency in Simhub to make it a bit quieter, but if it’s not mounted to a solid surface or you have any components that vibrate it can be pretty obnoxious.

For feel, it really took me a bit to really adapt to having them, but now it’s hard to race without them."
Good on you for listening to your neighbours
"You can get foam/rubber pads or even a platform to reduce it. I have a rig with Daytons in a second floor apartment, I consulted with my downstairs neighbor when I first set it up and sure enough they can't hear it (unless it's absolutely cranked up). But kudos for being neighborly."
"If you are using something like simhub, try testing it with the lfe from iracing directly. If there is no delay, the issue is with simhub.
I could be wrong but I thouht you had to pay for simhub to lose the delay, but again I could be wrong here"
"I’ve tried it. I even bought Sim hub to see if it would help and no bueno. 

Funny thing is I used this exact same setup 3 years ago on a previous rig and it worked flawless. Now it doesn’t matter what game I play or what program I use to fire the shakers they’re always late"
And it’s not a result of faulty internet and/or computer hardware?
Yeah this never happens in other sims (because there's nobody else to race with side by side)
Suck it up and move on. Events like this are so rare that they’re barely even worth worrying about.
66 ping=~10ft at 100mph
"What do you want them to do? Magically get rid of distance and latency? Only allow people to race if they’re in your house?

Go race LAN only if you can’t deal with the reality of the internet."
"Cool, this post again.."
You just need to accept that internet connections are not sufficient for racing high speed cars like F1 and the like. Do the sane thing and draw the line at GT3 and you'll be a lot happier.
People playing on Wi-Fi doesn’t help either. Wired connections are more reliable.
"There are two elements to this:

1. Physical limitations of communications.  Significantly slower than ""speed of light"" when you take the switches, boosters, etc. into account.
2. The predictive algorithm that works out where other cars are *likely* to be since the last concrete update.

Not a lot can be done about #1 if everything routes via the server.  The use of client-to-client comms has its own issues (each client reporting position info to all other clients) .  Abuse and network load being the two obvious.

One has to assume that #2 is something iRacing engineers are somewhat expert at and don't simply use a model as dumb as ""it went in a straight line from the last ping"".  I can see this being something that will improve with finesse and, potentially, AI learning.

An alternative would be to, somehow, hold-off on modelling contact until after there is a concrete ping/position but this could lead to some really odd effects.  Penalising people with poor internet (ghosting them and slowing them) might improve things for others but is much ""less real"""
"This is a connection issue and I'm not sure how you were able to tell what was causing it. Just blame Iracing I guess. 

Never happened to me with my Internet. 

Also the comment of overpriced is always a thing that makes me laugh. This isn't a Game its a service like going to the gold course and they need to rescan tracks pay for licences and much much more. 

Do the math of what you've spent then add up the amount of time you've had on the sim and do the % of how much it cost per year its literally the cheapest hobby I've ever had"
I think Iracing beats all other sims when it comes to how the cars look when your behind one. They move so naturally from one side of the track to the other where as ACC and RF2 look janky to me so I'll take a few mishaps that's sim racing.
"The only issue I ever have with the ""it's the limits of internet technology"" response that people always give is that I remember playing DTR:SC 20 some years ago on 56k dialup without these issues. I remember playing the EA NASCAR games 15ish years ago on 10Mbps DSL without this issue too."
This was a battle for the podium btw
"It's very hard to improve prediction algorithms like these I'm afraid these things will continue to happen occasionally. It's also impossible to significantly improve ping to people at the other side of the planet because of the simple physical impossibility to send data faster than the speed of light (it takes light a little over 140 ms to circle Earth once). 

Only real solution would be to ghost people who have a connection of, say, more than 100 ping to each other but that would impact realism and opens up other avenues to abuse (you can see how much ping you have towards other players so you'd know who you're going to ghost through and who you're not)."
"I am extremely thankful this never happens to me in iRacing. After 13 years, it's bound to happen one day."
"It's purely a function of ""speed of light"""
"And when you do find the one, active public ACC server, if you survive the T1 crash, the cars just phase through each other instead of registering any contact at all"
"Man, I have raced side by side on brands hatch with 260 ping (from internet from my cellphone, from Peru, which is very far from LFM servers) on acc without any problem. Anytime anyone shows an iRacing weakness with a good argument, he is down vote to obvivlion, or is told that is his problem/fault, or that he should go and play other Sim."
"I mean, yes, but it's worth noting that iRacing still does a fantastic job, and if you're in a lobby racing only people with a good connection, you can be super close quarters and fight hard even in F1 cars, SF, GTPs or stuff of similar speed. It's never going to be perfect, but I think iRacing rarely gets props for doing a good job with what is given and allowing everybody to race."
"Lol download speed doesn't determine latency 🤦🤦🤦. 

There is a reason why we could play counter strike source on 56k with 20 ping. The speed ≠ latency."
"In 1995, I was one of the early subscribers to NASCAR 95 online and I was using 56k dial up on a Packard Bell, 15"" monitor with toy like wheel & pedals. Oh yeah, the connection was long distance, which was expensive and a complete scam. I would've shit my pants then if I saw into the future the rig, wheelbase, load cell pedals, triple monitors and internet speed I'd be using. Oops, I think I just sharted myself thinking about it."
"Ok so how do you propose iRacing improves the speed of light to improve net code collisions?  

Additionally, the replay shows what the server resolved, but your contact actually happened based on prediction code ""in the moment"" which means you weren't affording enough room to the other car. 

Further, this contact would have still happened in a battle for 19th. Podium is irrelevant. "
"Not after that twilight zone disintegration of your car. Remember, online racing isn't perfect. Did you send in the video to iRacing support so maybe they can eliminate these bugs? The great thing about iRacing is you can jump right back in another race after that net code."
"i have almost 1400 starts in iracing. i can honestly say, i do not remember a netcode incident evenr 25% of the OP. These are fluke happenings and if they happen to someone a lot then its a hardware issue not the game."
"Do you know how ACC does that?

It basically just ignores contact. Lets cars phase inside of each other or through each other. 

It doesn't have better netcode, it simply gives up at trying to have netcode in 90% of situations. "
">(from internet from my cellphone, ...)

There's your issue. 

if you can, get a wired connection - otherwise make sure to keep your netcode bubble in mind at all times."
"Its not even a good argument tho, this happens in every single game in existence and you CANNOT fix it because people use varying different speed connections since everyone does not have access to the best possible connection.

Just because you have a good connection doesnt mean the other guy does... internet in general isnt completely stable either, its not like iracing has private cable lines going from everyones houses to their servers, thats the ONLY way to ""fix"" netcode... LAN connection.

&#x200B;

Since ACC ghosts people who use bad connection then your example doesnt really count does it? youre just being ghosted and claim theres no problems. well duh, cant have problems if you cant have contact."
im sitting about 20 feet away from my packard bell mechanical keyboard that i was using on nascar 95 that i got from a 33mhz packard bell p3.  the insides are kinda wild compared to what mk's of today look like.  i miss the internet of the early 90's and looking for non long distance bbs and never knowing what youre gonna find
"Speaking of Packard Bell I'm still surprised with how ""stupid people friendly"" that windows has become that modern operating systems don't include a UI based on Packard Bell Navigator/Microsoft Bob. Like if they had went with that for Windows 8 instead of the idiotic Tile setup it wouldn't have been a flop IMHO."
Podium is never irrelevant. It's the whole point why we race. Otherwise I agree with you on your other points. Prediction code happens but you learn from the experience and move on.
How can you watch that clip and say I wasn't affording enough room for the other car? Iracing can absolutely improve their prediction code. Defending things like this make no sense. We pay top dollar for a premium product that is supposed to be better than the competition but they can't even make their prediction software work right. I can understand some netcode issues if cars are within inches of each other. But not when the space can be measured in meters
ACC cars are twitchy when there's connection issues and it's annoying. But if it allows to go trough each other it's better than this to my taste – doesn't randomly ruin a race. It's a game in the end.
"Nah, was just for one race. The previous race I had, my router decided to just drop the signal when I had two mimutes left in the race. So decided to use my cellphone data for slow but consistent internet."
"We had the 386sx and the 486sx 33. Afterwards, I stopped buying pre-built and learned how to custom build computers. That's when eBay started and it was much easier to get components for custom builds. Oh the days of overclocking Celeron cpu's"
"This is sim racing, sure getting a podium or a win is nice, but its hardly the same as doing it on real life. You're there to race first and foremost,  be that for 1st or 21st."
"If they invest money in improving the speed of light then yes they can improve netcode. 

As it stands, the main ""solution"" people want is for contacts to not happen.  

Yes, in the replay it seems like you afforded enough room, but the prediction code which is what you see/interact with when you're driving, you did not.  "
"Letting cars twitch and warp and phase through each other is just silly and makes it look like a bad video game. 

Netcode prediction is right 99 times in 100 and allows the races to look like an actual car race. "
What about the other guy going too wide?
"It doesn't exactly work like that, it isn't like the cars phase through others all the time, is mostly on crashes where that would happen (not the best crash physics) unless someone have a so bad connection that he is teleporting all the time. The worst netcode I have ever had in ACC was from 10 cm away from the other car, in an Australian server (I am from Peru) with almost 400 ping. iRacing netcode prediction looks very good most of the time, but the fact that these type of crashes aren't strange to see on this subreddit, tells that this happen regularly. Even OP said he had 68 ping and still got ghost punted. Now think how much people have this same problem but doesn't post it."
"Have you also considered that iRacing has about 10000 times the number of online races per day as ACC?  

Of course there's going to be more examples of this when iRacing has twice as many races daily than ACC has had in its 6 years existence?  "
You can't.  Logitech sells a KB+trackpad which isn't particularly great as either but it's perfect for the short activities needed in VR
You want to use the ui in vr?
"[comprehensive RX tutorial](https://youtu.be/17vMp9st0dw?si=msEdYVJZzbRpS-Xu)

I am a 4.7k RX, not an alien but remember sideways is slow, don’t touch your e brake, and higher gear low revs on dirt."
"I just started this season too, such a blast! I have Dirt Rally 2.0 experience, but I've been mostly winging it too, watching the top split drivers occasionally in real time, but I'm still a good second or two off their pace, it's hard with no telemetry or explanation.  Guess that's not too much different from my normal road license pace, now that I think about it. Anyway, glad you're enjoying it too, and I'll be watching this thread as I have not found anyone making helpful guides on YouTube."
What helped me out in Rallycross was racing some dirt oval: learning how to control the car when sliding.
Which is better? Iracing or dirt rally 2?
"I'm nowhere near this level, but agree with the tips. Also hunt out any non-dirt surface you can. Most obvious on Phoenix Dirt coming out of the tight right hander on to the start/finish straight. Getting the right hand side of the car on to the kerb will gain about 0.5-1 sec (I think, I've only done it once!). 

Being accurate with car/tyre placement is more important than anything else I think."
Have you read the sporting code?
"If a league is looking for D 3.0 or D 4.0, getting your C Class license is enough. The license class is what matters more than the actual rating in the class."
"You drop a point when you're promoted because higher licence holders are supposed to be safer. So your Corners-per-incident metric which was considered good for Rookie is only considered average for a D class, and so on.

You get promoted by becoming cleaner, and therefore getting a higher corners-per-incident metric. Race in whatever you find easier to be clean in, but remember that higher licence series tend to have longer races, which helps."
"if you've got a D license you can run any series requring a D licence (ie. GT4 fixed) regarless of your actual numbered SR

when you get promoted you're not going back to 2.4 of your previous class or whatver, you're going to 2.4 of the *next* class above

Below A, the only way you can reach above 3.0 SR at a particular license level is if you don't run enough races (MPR) at that level to promote automatically. However, if you can manage to reach an SR of 4.0 at a lower licence level without auto promoting you're allowed to enter races at the next highest licence despite not actually having that license. So you could theoretically drive Fixed Ferrari at D to promote to C, and then continue to drive Fixed Ferrari to reach C 4.0, at which point you wouldn't promote automatically to B (because MPR), but would then be allowed to enter GT3 fixed and VRS at B, skipping C licence series entirely"
"You have no other choice than Ferrari or GT4 and yes, you can enter both with even D1.00"
"An A1.0 is better than a D4.99.


Higher licenses matter more than the number. If a league requires a d2.0 rating then a C1.00 is fine to race."
"My suggestion would be to reach out to the league you’re interested in; as their requirements are separate from iRacing. 

However generally speaking it’s understood that something that requires a D3.0 will accept a C2.0, for example."
"Race GT4. It will teach you to be safe, which is what you need to get a C licence."
Yea but the promotion aspect confused me
The dropping a point is also because there's overlap between the licences in terms of CPI. 
Thank you for the explanation
Not leagues
You can even go below 1.0 in D
"It's a bit more complicated, A1.0 has worse incidents per corner ratio than D4.99. But A class can race everything.

D4.99 player can do MPRs trough time trials and end up at A1.99 (ignoring SR gain in TT)"
It’s the iRacing league. Ferrari challenge and the gt4
He’s actually talking about official series and not leagues as evident by one of his comments. Just confused the terms.
Challenge accepted
To clarify: the official offerings are called “series” in iRacing lingo.  “Leagues” would be user-managed series.
Ah okay thank you. Whoops
"I'm really not sure that anyone in this video did any of this intentionally. If you told me both people slipped and fell on their mice to even enter the session, I'd believe you."
Who are you mad at? The guy locking up or the guy who turns into the dude locking up?
"Looks like they locked up and tried to save, suddenly noticed you thus causing them to hit the brakes in a panic hoping to avoid a wreck, but inadvertently made a wreck unavoidable instead."
"Road Atlanta and Road America are must buys, the rest are take it or leave it for me"
Use iRacing buyers guide (https://www.irbg.net) to see the tracks coming up in the series you race to get maximum bang for your buck as a starting point. No reason to buy Imola (for example) if it’s not appearing in any season calendar for you to actually race in.
Avoid COTA.
"Road Atlanta, Imola, Road America and Mugello are great. Especially Road Atlanta, one of my favourite tracks.

I'm neutral about the others. Except Barcelona, which I really don't like at all."
"Mugello, road Atlanta, road America for 3 (10% off) but add Imola, Aragón and magny cours for 6 (15% off)"
for open wheelers you'll get more mileage out of Barcelona and Imola
"Can’t say what I would buy. It’s easier to say what I wouldn’t buy. 

I didn’t buy Aragon, Motegi, Ledenon, and Magny course as they aren’t really popular. (Magny course is popular in gt3 though)

I don’t like racing at Barcelona. It’s a very technical track that is hard to overtake. 

I have COTA, it’s ok for me, but I play in VR. Many people don’t like the track on a single monitor. Unless you have VR or triple maybe you should avoid it. 

Because I drive open wheelers, I don’t really like road America. The curbs on this track is just a bit too much for these little cars. I’m unsure about the ride height of a lmp3, but gt3 can race it very well."
"Check your series and just buy tracks for what you drive. If I remember right a few of your choices don't come up in gt3, lmp3, f4, f3.
I'd not buy tracks I don't use or are maybe only used in 1 series. But that depends on your budget and what you already own. Road Atlanta is often used, therefore i bought it. The others are subjective decisions but I'd say no 100% buy-tracks.."
"Your best bang for buck will be Road America, Road Atlanta and Imola. Rest are meh."
"Agreed. I think for others I would probably choose between imola, mugello, hockenheim"
"I agree, those two are great, though I also quite enjoy Imola."
"I'd add Mugello to these two - it's new this season, so likely to pop up a lot in the next few seasons. Aside from that, Imola is a great track and used a lot."
Seconded. Its awkward and off tracks are annoying
This is the way.
"This is similar to the route I was going. I have 3 cars that I already plan on getting to add to the collection for the 10% and was going to add 3-4 tracks for the 15% off.

Thinking it's gonna be Mugello, Road Atlanta, Road America, and I need to choose between one of these(Aragon, Imola, Hockenheimring). Aragon seems like the most fun of those 3 but I like Imola and Hockenheimring from personal experience. Then will probably get some of the remaining tracks next time I invest more into it."
"It's a great track. But if you're just starting out building your catalog, it can wait. Don't let the off track people convince you not to get it eventually though."
I think it’s more like avoid cota unless you have VR/triple. Personally I think it’s on par with Suzuka. It flows really well and is super rewarding if you get some very fast corners right.
"Love COTA as a track but haven't seen it on many series schedules. Starting to get to the back half of the catalog for road tracks so it's getting there but will probably hold off on it until next season and see if they plan on using the track more often. If it ends up on more schedules, will definitely be in the catalog."
Agreed. Fantastic track to race. The only place that offtracks are even remotely an issue is the hairpin.
Does the series make you use the alternate tires? I believe you have to for Indycar for one of the stops
I bet you didn’t change tires. It’s required in this series.
"Session Events:  

 > 1:15:33.350 Post Race Penalty: Too few tire compounds, DQ - Scoring invalidated, Lap 10, #6 Bruno Nascimento2 
> 1:15:33.350 Post Race Penalty Total Applied: disqualified, #6 Bruno Nascimento2"
Ah I was in this race. I saw that on the relative. Theres the little tire that turns purple if someone switched tires you didn’t have it. Almost said something in chat about it but didn’t… maybe there was a strat and maybe you weren’t in anyway was my logic.
"Oh, it might have been this. I made sure to have the replacement tire checked for each tire on my black box, but this is the first time I have heard about alternate tires. How can I check that? Is it under the ""tires"" black box as well?"
Thank you!
"You were there? That’s cool, hope you were one of the few survivors, haha. That’s ok though, at least now I know, and it was worth for the ridiculous amount of SR gained."
"Yes, it’s under the “tires” black box.  “Primary” is the black sidewall (generally slower but longer wearing), “alternate” is the red sidewall (generally faster but shorter wearing)"
"Pretty sure, though commenting cause I'd like to learn lol"
"Thanks for the explanation, very helpful"

Where are the majority of you guys based? I'm gonna guess Europe from your names?
I was in your split as a gt3 driver and saw your team crashing and racing the leaders super hard after being laps down. Kinda unsportsmanlike if you ask me. My mates were reporting the same thing when I was driving we were scared about your teams and the leader crashing us lol
Mainly Europe but we had a Brazilian and a Canadian driver in the lineups. Drivers from the outside of Europe are more then welcome 😉
"If the intention was to take them out I am sure we would have found a more subtle way to do it then ramming into them on pit entry. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin) I just re-watched the replay and the same driver in our car brakes for another pit stop at the same spot and makes the pit entry just fine. 

I am glad it didn't took the win away from them, it wouldn't be the way how we want to win a race. 

In hindsight maybe they raced them too hard, just because of the fact that they were our sister team, meanwhile we also had to overtake several lapped GTP's like it was for position."
"Ya I watch the sister car fight way too hard in my opinion. Even shoved the leader off when they were clearly side by going into the bustop. I understand  wanting to help the team but a blue flag is a blue flag. The sister car even pushed the leader off in turn 2 and wrecked themselves and a gt3 in the process. Really shitty racing from a car that’s 15 laps down even if it’s to help the team, makes the team as a whole look bad"
"Welcome, im new aswell. Had a blast in MX-5 and 1600. Ferrari and f4 has been a disaster. Went from 1850 IR and 3,90 SR in D to soon sub 1200 IR and soon down to rookies again. Getting taken out, pushed in The rear and fucked over. Once every 5 to 6 race i have one excellent and idiot free race and its The best thing ever.. fucking up myself is no problem, but it is impossible actually trying ti race and not getting taken out by. I obviously take it way too seriously, but its killling The joy entirely"
"> and soon down to rookies again.

You can't get relegated from D, so don't worry about that.

Even though you can't be relegated though, it could still be a good idea to spend more time in rookie series. I'm 300 races in and still love the rookie Mazda series."
"I had this kind of thing happen like 5/6 years ago at le mans. got a cone stuck under the car and the car drove like it had massive damage for a lap and a half. Understeering everywhere and super slow down the straights. as soon as the cone popped out, the car was driving fine again and we were able to carry on like nothing had happened."
"That's why I always avoid those things at all costs. 
Wonder if it would help to try scrape it off in the grass or gravel"
"Possibly. I would've helped to know i had it under there as well. I saw all the other cars just bouncing it off them, but apparently the Ferrari eats it up and doesn't like to spit it out until much later."
I use SoundBlaster G6. It's a amazing USB sound card with amplifier for demanding headphones. Good software and audio quality.
This has happened to me before I accidentally pulled the cable which connects my headset and the game crashed
I will get random crashes because of sound. I went and bought a sound blaster instead of using the motherboard sound card and never had a problem in the last couple years
Another sign (aside from the relative window) that you're blinking is that you'll be getting Invalid Lap messages as you cross the line.
"Watch your relative. If you see every other car vanish from it, you blinked. 

If you see one car vanish from it, they blinked."
"Dear god this is the worst, I was following a guy whos car was doing this and it was damn near impossible to judge what was going on"
People would DM you. At least I always do
"Listen to voice chat. People usually call it out. You can also just ask. 

Starlink is actually pretty decent when it comes to latency. It’s a low earth orbit satellite system, much much better than older generation satellite internet systems. As it happens where you are is mostly irrelevant for starlink unless there’s congestion. 

Starlinks latency is pretty comparable to copper internet technologies like ADSL, which many folks are still using. 

Connect your PC to your starlink router via Ethernet. Beyond that, I doubt you’ll have much of a problem at all."
"OK. Thanks, that seems like a pretty obvious sign! Have never seen that aside from a full dc, so sounding positive! Would hate it if I was inflicting that on other people."
"This is not correct, if cars disappear from the relative that means cars are disappearing for him / downstream packet loss. You blinking means you are losing upstream packets, the other cars could look perfectly fine for you.

Turn on your meters, Q meter is for packet loss which will show you."
"Protest it.

Edit:

if someone who has a severe connection issue and doesn't seem to care they can be protested. On first offense they will receive the following letter...

""After reviewing all of the available information we do find the accusations of racing with a very bad connection are accurate. We respectfully ask that you do what you can to improve your latency when racing with others. We also ask that if you are having a connection issue that you pull over and move out of the way of other drivers who cannot race with someone who has a bad connection. Our goal is to simply try and avoid this situation in the future. Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated.""

If after this the driver continues racing without care for their connection and other members and are protested a second time they will receive a one week suspension. This is the procedure for this type of issue where we reviewed a replay of the issues and rule fairly that it was happening and an unfair issues for the other drivers.

Hopefully that helps with understanding on this issue. Remember we will all have an internet issue from time to time so, this is not for someone who blinks or someone who is not causing an issue in the race. It is to be used when someone is clearly causing an issue, told about the issue by others, and then seems not to care for what is going on.

What is protesting a blinker going to do?
"Unfortunately I didn't save the replay otherwise I would have, honestly just  finished the race and needed a breather lol 

really need to turn on auto-save"
Read my post again extra info added
Yep. Not like they deliberately did something terrible. I’d treat it as a mechanical fault of sorts if it fucks my race

"I stand corrected. If I’m following a car and they constantly launch towards the moon all the time, is that me or them?"
If no other cars are doing it generally them.
Ooof this ones real bad
"When I was playing in 2014. I was blinking. A lot. 
Like I didn’t know myself I was blinking. Everything was fluid but only my car was blinking and nobody around me was. 

I had a race with some friends and one was looking at me. Start to see my blinking problem (it was couple of seconds. But awefull for everyone around me). Then he start to see that my blinking happened every x seconds and ask me if I had something on my network for that. 

My ISP was 1Gb/s bandwidth upload & download at this time. So it didn’t make any sense. 

But then I try to think and had one of the first chromecast. And everytime the chrome cast changed the wallpaper, it download it all and make me blink. I unplug the chrome cast and then, no blinking anymore. 

I don’t know if the game is able to show you (LIVE) that your are blinking. I first see that in my laps history. But in game. Nothing show you that. And don’t talk about the little thing on the top right, when I drive I barely look at it. "
"I finally agree, this is completely unacceptable. Worst thing about it is that he's streaming live, get your priorities straight if your ISP fucking sucks lol"
"Wow, yeah thats way too long to be disconnected."
Oooof. That’s rough dude. So sorry. Absolutely my worst fear in a special event.
Holy crap!!!!!
"I had a situation last night trying to re-join, waited for the field, they pass, completely  clear, I pull out and two cars appear in front of me at full speed and BANG. 

100% my fault from their perspective, but there was nobody in my screen when I started my entry."
"Oof, that one is bad"
"Yeah, I know some people don’t even know they are blinking. But I’ve had races when I’ve let people know they are jumping all over the place and I got “too bad, what do you want me to do about it”. Obviously this an extreme case but if someone is trying to get around a car that is blinking, it is good sportsmanship to let them pass."
"Ok, that’s ridiculous

IRacing needs to institute a much lower minimum ping."
That needs to be an automatic black flag
ARCA brakes /s
"I’ve said it many times before, these people should be removed from the session. This blinking is really unacceptable."
Oh shit thats in my split. They've stopped blinking since but one of our drivers has moments too
"[Seen this one before](https://streamable.com/sk6kri). I've personally ""tested"" this by accidentally knocking out my own ethernet cable for 5+ seconds and loaded back into a race almost seamlessly.

Funnily enough, it's starting to become a competition issue in Oval with *certain* top drivers using lag switch programs to avoid massive wrecks on the 1.5+ mile tracks (by pressing a button on their wheel that pauses network connections for x seconds). 

I mean if iRacing won't do anything consistent lag spikes, I can certainly see the appeal of using it to your advantage."
What. The. F.  Sorry to see this happened to your team.
I mean you hit him from behind? Are you blind? How did you not see him?
"No biggie, not like you have any time invested in that race. Move on bruh. /s"
thats rough. sorry OP.
Oh gods
"shit has been crazy this weekend all over Daytona. I've been dropping iR abs SR like mad over the past 2 days. after losing over 300iR and .80SR, I've put the Ferrari away and began working with the F4 I picked up just for rainy days like this. hoping that not having doors and bumpers will help folks to not abuse my doors and bumpers."
I had a guy disappear for a couple corners on a race the other night before he was finally disconnected. I kept wait and waiting for him to respawn thinking any second I was gonna run into him. Luckily I don't come across this much but how are you supposed to carry on when you never know if the blinker is going to reappear in a spot you didn't anticipate?
"WiFi is a common cause of these issues. Bits of interference can cause temporary packet loss with WiFi. I do wish iRacing did a better job of strongly encouraging drivers to use an Ethernet connection to their router for iRacing. 

But ultimately, as much as this sucks; it could also have just been a fluke. Something that perhaps hasn’t happened before. 

Totally agree though that iRacing needs to figure something out with regards to blinkers and how they affect other users. I know iRacing try’s very hard not to implement any “arcade” style features but… stuff like this surely isn’t “enhancing the realism”."
In addition to this we copped 7 minutes of damage after netcode to right rear bumper from a gtp. Didnt even unsettle the car and was a 0x contact... cost us a genuine podium chance being in the second stint of the race and we never lost a lap to p1 after that and had pace on almost every car and every driver in front. Worked back up to p6 regaining multiple laps in the process on drivers.
"Fuck man, that is atrocious."
Update: this driver was gone from the session for over 10 seconds without any reconnection at all.
I’m getting so tired of the disappearing/reappearing cars.
OMG thanks iRacing
🤣🤣🤣🤣 HEY
How is this iRacing's fault? Blame the guy with the shit connection. iRacing can't magically make high ping work.
"I was using headphone audio software that was pushing my ping to 300,   I’m on dedicated single run of fiber all the way to my router,  router is 3 ft from sim rig.  

How software can do this is beyond my comprehension,  it happened to 2 of us in our league"
"Why you shunt him, poor fella"
There servers have had issues I can’t finish a race without disconnecting
Oooof yeah that sucks
this is actually how my Roar 2.4 got prematurely ruined. by some fuck face that spawned in mid turn entering the oval from the road course
"Was seeing a lot of blinking and rubber banding in Jimmy's stream at the start. It's so hard to tell when or where someone will be. It seemed like a server issue then. This one we only see one car so it could be either. But what a shitty way to affect a race. Had no idea there was a car there.

It would be interesting if the were able to have like a ghost situation. Like if your connection isn't up to snuff you ghost for a few seconds after your stability calms down. But then it's a wonder if people would use that to their advantage. I remember the hacks people would do in Halo 2 where you'd spawn in and then have a connection issue and the other team won somehow. And it sucks for any game when this happenes during one of their big events. So many eyes are on these races to then have these sorts of issues really hurts the brand."
Remember what you pay monthly for...
Peekaboo
" Hello, I am a driver of the car that disappears, I wanted to comment that when it happened it put all the drivers on a black screen except the one driving, that all the track cars disappeared and he was left alone and 5 seconds later it appears and we leave in the face of the GTP, to say that the pilot has a good connection and that it did not fail again or anything in all 24 hours, with this I mean that we did not do it on purpose nor did the pilot have a bad connection... I am sorry for the accident as We told you and we can't do anything if the server fails. Greetings and sorry for my English as a translator xD"
"During my Roar race the week before last I blinked out for almost a lap, all of a sudden all other drivers disappeared from my race and the overlays went blank. I panicked because I was doing well and it was the only session that I was able to race that weekend, but I ended up returning on track almost exactly where I was when I disappeared. I assumed I didn't take anyone out with me, apologised for blinking and went on."
Ive seen some *insanely* long blinks so far in the 4th time slot. Its wild.
"There are ping and quality meters that can be enabled on the same performance monitor that shows fps. I personally found it difficult to spot though. I ended up putting ping and quality values on one of my dash screens, and they turn yellow and red when things go south. They’re much easier for me to notice there, because they’re significantly larger and in a place that I look at somewhat regularly. 

As an aside, your experience is exactly why good QoS is important even with extremely high throughput. High speed Internet isn’t a panacea. It may be far more difficult to saturate Gb on a sustained basis, but bursting in excess of Gb is probably somewhat common, especially on the download side. All it takes is one device on your network to hammer the connection to screw you. Unfortunately, I doubt effective QoS for gaming is common in typical consumer routers, and even if it is available, most people probably don’t know how to enable and/or configure it."
Do you know the driver who blinked?
I wonder thought i haven't been able to find a channel from the not so clear imagine. So i'm curious if you have checked that th3y are live and that it is also the person in the video who is streaming
It might be the servers. I watched a few streamers at the start and it looked like everyone was having problems although it did seem to improve.
Why was this the one that made you finally agree? This shit happens in almost every race with people from different regions
"It is possible that one of the drivers had their twitch on the car and not the one blinking through the multiverse....possible and maybe unlikely, but still possible. Idk OP go watch them and spam their chat with blinkyboyz"
If only iracing cared about the service we paid for
This happens all the time. “Not my problem” approach kills it for everyone
It's not ping it's quality.
This could easily be abused
Wish you the best of luck in your 24
"Wow, that should be a perma-ban."
"It's not ""starting to become an issue"" it's BEEN an issue for a number of years. Ray has been accused of using one for a very long time, there used to be a video up on YT of him streaming a race, as a pileup starts in front of him, he appears to press a button on his wheel and he manages to drive through it with no harm, then he comments about ""thank you lag.."" or something along those lines."
Thanks for your thoughts. Will be taking a long break from Iracing
I’d like to say I like the sarcasm here and I don’t understand the downvote. 
1 month of practice down the drain. I haven’t even shared it but we were leading the 7am split as well. Got punted from behind and forced the restart at 11….Where this happened
Crying in the club rn
Legitimately has ruined the Iracing service for me. This experience today just being the cherry on top to that
"High ping isn't the issue. Packet loss and quality issues are the problem. The car was gone for at least 6 seconds. At that point drop it from the server, or force tow it so if they regain connection quality they can rejoin the race."
"If you can ghost for a few seconds people will abuse this BADLY. Starting at the back? Ah, just jiggle the ethernet cable right before the T1 Braking Zone."
Unfortunate situation for all.  Thanks for your comment
"That's not a blink, that's a full respawn."
"Exactly this! Once I enabled QoS on my router and set my gaming computer with top priority I never had a problem after. 

Most people don't realize the  modem/router/combo device the ISP provides is pretty much crap... Plus they usually charge monthly to rent it...  Don't get me started on the Xfinity Mobile and their Xfinity routers."
"Yeah the worst part is. That’s kind of my job. 
With the Apple TV and the 4k movie screen saver I could understand it took every bandwidth, but the chrome cast and jpeg download ? Didn’t think about it a second. 

But my chromcast at this time was an import from the US so maybe it didn’t help here :))"
"I’m pretty sure what you’re describing cost me a win in this last Petit Le Mans. I have a chrome cast as well. Also, after the race my teammate sent a large replay file and every time I tried to download it in chrome my connection would go out. iRacing seems particularly sensitive, where the UI is littered with disconnect and reconnect alerts and nothing else seems to be having trouble staying connected. Anyway I don’t know what QoS is, but I’m going to look into it. I’ve been using a modem router from my ISP but I also have a 2nd router, so I’m wondering if I should dedicate it to my gaming machine."
Their Twitch is plastered across their rear bumper
I honestly hadn’t noticed this until you guys pointed it out. Honestly the team that flashed in said sorry and apologized for the blink. Said they have great internet ect. We’re more upset at iracing for allowing connection issues like this.
"It is the server or the routing to the server, yesterday I got disconnected out of nowhere, went and check my router logs, and ofc my internet was fine the whole time"
"I guess it depends on where you are from and the speed of your connection because generally I find it ok.

There's the odd guy from South America or Australia but mostly it's fine. Today during the 24 hr seemed to be the exception."
"Yeh boo to the iracing devs, clearly they don't care for the product they have been making for 15 years and are just involved in sim racing because it's financing their millionaire lifestyles."
"I’d be super mad right now too. When you’ve cooled off in a couple days, send that clip in to support with a reasoned email about why that’s an issue for iRacing’s product. 

I’m going to guess that the addition of the abnormal lap messages is the beginnings of them rolling out a system that deals with bad connections. 

Personally, I think a blip here and there is just a product of infrastructure that they can’t do anything about plus it happens occasionally to everyone, but… if a car is regularly blinking from a poor connection in a race, bouncing all over, disappearing for seconds at a time, it needs to be dealt with from iRacing’s side. 

Maybe the first big blink or 2 gets a ghost for a couple seconds, but if it continues, it’s a disconnect. There’s probably a ratio that can discourage cheating (lag switches) but also prevent issues like this as well. 

That is the worst, most inopportune, blink I’ve ever seen though for sure. 

I had a bad connection that took me months to get sorted. I didn’t race while it was happening because it would have been inconsiderate and it was super frustrating. My ISP was really shitty about fixing it even though it was entirely on their end and I had the data to prove it."
"Yep, and those are the guys that will usually end up being a weapon on track too."
They really need to be stricter about upload packet loss. That’s what’s impacting others being able to see you.
Came here to say that
"Thanks, we've had some issues but holding P6 overall"
"Dang, shame to hear you'll be taking a break.  Hopefully not too long.  One of our teams had a similar instance today, but thankfully they avoided.  Also, and not nearly as bad as what you went through, but my spotter stopped working.  Had to open our car up at the start with no spotter, just teammates.  It was quite annoying to say the least."
It’s Reddit and Reddit does what reddits gonna do lol
Here before some redditor gives a drawn out explanation of “poe’s law”
"I mean, it's not that he made a joke. He just made the most obvious, low hanging fruit joke... just kinda low effort tbh"
On some levels this isn't wrong. OP clearly wasn't looking ahead. If he was he would have seen the car disappear.
"Brutal. I feel your pain, my old team used to do this race every year but I just don't have it in me anymore."
6 seconds is barely anything. You can't know exactly what's going on from this clip and if iRacing was more stringent people would be kicked from sessions left and right.
That's what I'd be worried about. But how many would do something like that? And maybe it's a strike system. You get get three but then it's a tow back to pits and if it's happening multiple races then it a ban? But then who polices that? That would be a whole team to review those. Only other thing I can think of if it blinks for more than like more than 4 seconds it just dumps you in the pits. And you start again once it's stable again. I really don't know if there is anything that is fair. Sometimes it is a fluke thing and you can't control it. You can have the best internet in the world and you can drop. Idk what the solution would be.
That's a Forza rewind after missing the chicane
"Yes, ditch the ISP router for your own. Bear in mind though that QoS needs to sit over the entire internet connected network. QoS = Quality of Service. It’s basically the queuing of network traffic into “waiting lines” when necessary and trying to let traffic from the various queues through in some sort of fair manner. More sophisticated queuing tries to prioritize critical, time sensitive traffic (e.g., VoIP) or even just traffic you say is important (e.g., work vs general use PCs) over more generic traffic (e.g., downloads, web browsing). 

Internet traffic isn’t the steady flow that speed tests often make it seem. It’s actually more like bursts. Infrequent, very transient bursts often aren’t going to be an issue for iRacing, but a long series of bursts even over a relatively short period can be. Impact can range from iRacing traffic being massively delayed to flat out being dropped. QoS can help make sure iRacing’s traffic gets through well enough even if some other device is doing a massive download at speed during the course of a race. When we had 75/20 service, my son could be downloading at the highest average speeds possible, and my ping and quality wouldn’t budge. Without queuing, I’d be the car blinking in and out and trampolining off the track. When we moved to 1000/20, I still needed some sort of queuing for the times something manages to pull big bursts. 

Here’s the rub though. Not all queuing is created equal, and enabling QoS in your router won’t guarantee the problem will be fixed. Poorly implemented queuing may technically help but not to any extent you’d notice. Still, even the worst queue will at least give you a chance."
"Dumb Q, what do you suggest they do about it?"
I got two disconnects form packet loss during the first few laps. I never got them before
Devs don’t make these decisions typically. That is management.
"I definitely see your point, if I’m honest I feel the anger has passed at this point. Just disappointed with the service. I haven’t played iracing since we won petit lemans last year. Purely practiced for Daytona over the last month and got taken out of the lead two different splits in a row.  Connection issues and poor driving standards are what previously drove me away from the service. Seems things have done nothing but stay the same."
or maybe have better netcode
"Well done, finish strong!"
"Oh man, couldn’t imagine that. Would be tough for sure. Hopefully you guys are able to finish the race!"
We are in 2024. Didn’t we awards people who made low effort more than people who make effort ? :)))
"Ironic... he could see others' low effort, but not his own"
"At minimum 6 seconds from this clip. And that's a huge amount of time for a server and endpoint to have no communication at all in a game like iRacing. 
Needing to know exactly what is going on isn't the point ultimately it comes down to some form of connection drop between the iRacing server and the user that was invisible, still isn't a ping issue though, latency (ping) is just how long packets are taking between the server and endpoint and vice versa.

The point is iRacing can deal with this level of connection drops in a better way that only disadvantage the person with the connection issues than allowing them to phase back into existence after a long time like in this clip."
"6 seconds is barely anything? that's 420 metres or a quarter of a mile that a car just disappears.

that's not barely anything, that's horrific."
"Thank you so much for this write up. I really think someone like you or with networking knowledge should do a “how to” configure a network for iRacing on high priority race days. Obviously everyone’s situation might be a little different, for instance I need to accommodate my partners zoom calls on weekdays, but on a special event day I need priority."
"If you blink for that long, you ghost for X seconds when you reappear.
If you blink for that long, you are disqualified and don't come back.

There are a myriad of different ways to go about it."
"If you blink, they could ghost your car and allow to drive through the other car momentarily."
"If your connection is that poor, not race."
What management choice resulted in long blinking?
"Yeah, I don't know what series you usually drive, but some of them are rough. 

I've been on since 2011. Back then, there weren't as many people and the driving standards were pretty awesome from what I remember. I moved to Denver in 2013 and the series I liked were never populated when I could race, so I got out of the habit of racing for a long time. I just got back in to it enough that I'm racing every week and I've noticed some things that are worse than they were back when I was really into it. (Way more people blowing up the radio and yelling during races etc.)

It seems like covid maybe brought a lot more people into the sim, on the one hand, the stuff I like is always populated now, on the other, there are a lot more hot-lappers that can't race, people abusing the mic, etc. It's a catch 22 I guess. Fortunately, production car cup is pretty chill for me, haha. 

I will say that the first 24 I did, we had a team messing with us, me in particular. They were a lap down to us early in the race, I had just gotten in for my stint and this guy was holding me back several seconds off my pace. He'd let anyone else in the class through, but when I got to him, he'd brake early if I was behind him and park it, or if I got next to him, he's suddenly the master of late-braking. He forced me into a couple off-tracks and I'd lose ground only to catch him within the lap again so it wasn't just draft keeping us close. I tried all sorts of stuff to set him up, we were way faster through the bus stop so I started using that as an advantage to get him for T1. He realizes this and starts lifting on the exit to break my momentum, I figure that out so then he starts leaving the bottom open on the oval and then closing it just as I get to his bumper. We dealt with them for about 15 minutes like this before I finally just didn't back out one time and sent him through the infield. We hadn't had any interactions with them before this and it was too early in the race to be that aggressive, but I was over it and they were costing us 5-7 seconds a lap. 

Late in the race they hip checked our driver into the wall at the bus stop and started taunting us over the radio and in chat, so we dug up their stream. They were all high rated oval drivers in a lower split so they knew what they were doing. We found where he started messing with me and one of his teammates asked him what his problem was with me. ""I don't know, I just don't think I like him."" 

I emailed Nim directly while all this was going on and he was super responsive about it. None of us had replay spooling on, so we didn't have replays, but he told us to send in what we could gather and that he understood it was a way different situation since you can't just move on to the next race in an hour and the special events have a lot more time invested. 

That was a lot to say that iRacing definitely cares about things going smoothly for the special events."
"Based on my experience, if the replay gets to the right person there's a good chance it'll get looked into. The challenge is getting it to that person. 

If you haven't already, it may be worth emailing support and/or posting this along with the replay file (assuming you have it) in the problem reporting section of the forums.

Hell, posting it in the general discussion forum has a good chance of getting seen by iRacing staff."
"Only so much net code can do if there's no information reaching the server. The two options are really the current blink approach, or to keep the cars visible and just maintain their current steering angle / pedal inputs and lerp them back to their real position once you finally get an update.

The second option is used (albeit slightly more complex than my description) in most online games, especially things like fps's. However in a game like iRacing this would likely be far more destructive than blinking as cars would just drive full steam off the course (or ignore braking zones) at corners during packet loss. Note than iRacing does employ this strategy for a short time before blinking out the affected car.

Really, if you want to allow players with high packet loss to compete in a game where a single collision can mean death,  what you need is some kind of crash prevention mechanic once the player reconnects, like disable collisions temporarily so that they don't spawn right Infront of / inside other players and kill them.

Really the only perfect solution is for everyone to have great internet though, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon"
"Thanks o7 up to P5, the CERT-1 Cadillac had a massive wreck. Car 29 and 8 are 4 seconds apart fighting for the lead with just under 4 hours to go"
"Yep!  Since then we all load crew chief onto our pcs lol.  So atleast thats working for us.  We've got 9 cars here today, and thankfully all of us have been fairly clean, except our top GT3, who got taken out by a 3ft netcode LMP2.  cost them 11min in dmg."
That’s the most Reddit thing ever
">At minimum 6 seconds from this clip. 

See but you can't claim that. Other posts have shown that sometimes people are visible without receiving data from iRacing, other times the opposite. I still feel like the OP is a bit complain-y towards iRacing."
I wish iRacing would change the netcode for all the whiners just so I can see all the complaints about getting kicked too often.
6 seconds is a lot in a live race
First blink is free. Second is an instant tow. Third time is a dq.
"Is that possible to tell server side? Are there other games that do this? Not trying to be difficult, just want to know what I'm rallying behind haha"
Are you being sarcastic or genuinely curious?
"The choice of how lenient to be with connection standards, and at what threshold to boot a user from the session. 

If they make it too strict, people will get dropped from the session left right and center. Too lax and... well... you get this."
Wish we were in that fight. It hurts more knowing we were the fastest car on track for the short amount of time that we were able to race. Sounds like it’s been a war. Anything can happen now. Bring it home in the last 4 hours
It’s huge.
"Meh that's harsh. You can have millisecond blinks that barely matter unless you're around people very tight. Especially over hours, two for tow"
"If you disconnect from the server, it doesn't record your laptimes and you get a message up the top saying something along the lines of ""abnormal lap - discontinuity"".

So they can clearly tell somethings going wrong."
"Yes, server can detect and enforce excessive packet loss"
Yes. The whole reason why blinking happens is that the cars internet is so shit the server doesnt know where it is due to packet loss. This is 100% detectable and many games even have warning indicators or counters that show how bad it is. And many games will auto kick from the server if its bad enough.
"The night was pretty hectic. We also have a legend doing the race solo just barely hanging on by muscle memory

We'll fight like hell 🫡"
"Millisecond blinks shouldn’t be a thing in the first place, nor the damn wheelies the cars do. These should be smoothed out with a little predictive algorithm. A longer or excessive blinking should be giving people some kind of warning, ghosting out a car at a minimum, but as this is sim racing and trying to be the real thing, a penalty and or disqualification for severe cases are warranted, consider it like failing a technical inspection for your equipment."
Yeah distance to others and the type of race should be factored in.  I’m just sick of it ruining racing
"Tough shit. If you have the internet problems, it shouldn't be everyone else's."
If you’re an oval track guy you’re used to millisecond blinks clearing entire fields. It’s not acceptable.
That’s what abnormal lap means? Today I learned.
"Thank you, makes sense!"
IRacing has an overlay to show this. I don’t remember exactly where it but it’s in he Options menus
What a legend. Bring home the best result you can for Newport please. Do it for us! 😂
Feel free to write up the code that does that smoothly and works for everyone all of the time with 0 issues regardless of internet quality/speed etc and collect your free millions of pounds.
"Except when it’s a server side issue, cause hey that never happens! 🙄 absolutes in online gaming will never work out."
"It's used for other things too, if you're serving a slowdown while crossing the line I think that also counts as an abnormal lap"
Will do!
"P5 at the flag! #29 Porsche won by a lap over the #8 Cadillac. Solo guy finished P36 overall (even though officially he got DQ'd)

No.10 Ferrari won the GT3 class"
"I’m not saying there aren’t challenges with networking, especially with the time traveling problems it has, but there ARE absolutely better solutions than a car just disappearing for a few milliseconds or bouncing and wheelies! That isn’t the end of world to keep interpolating with last know trajectory for a few hundred milliseconds before disappearing and blinking, and then once there is a blink of any long enough period there should be a soft reconnection or such instead of “bam” car…

These are issues that aren’t terribly challenging, comparatively to the network issues, but would bring serious quality improvements. Source, I’m a developer, and while I haven’t got as far along with time travel issues of networking, I have written multiplayer code first hand."
"Our league has a ""rain delay"" rule thats basically if a bunch of people disconnect quickly, it's assumed server issue, everyone hits pits and stops til they rejoin. Basically red flag the race due to it being unfair"
"""If ***you*** have internet problems""

If it's one person blinking, it's a client issue."
"I was wondering how it all ended up, top 5 after 24 hours is amazing. Congratulations! That’s the yellow Porsche right? #29?"
Wow what place was that green car in?
Lol the chaos this week has been insane. Something about this track makes people lose their minds.
That dude was trying to intentionally wreck one of the cars going into Les Combes but missed. Definitely report this.
"This sums up my week entirely. Almost uninstalled like 4 times due to excactly this. Its every race, unavoidable"
Two long straights into chicanes be like that. The straights are slightly too long for these cars
"It’s been rough, even in top split. Can’t wait for this week to be over"
He got a large punishment because he was a repeat offender in this case. He’s been caught for cheating/exploiting before and that’s why his ban was for a year.
"Most drivers who do dumb shit aren't representing a Formula 1 esports team in a big streamed event iRacing was trying to use to boost their brand. iRacing had to send a message that this behavior will not be tolerated if they want to grow the esports side of things. This also wasn't the first time that this same team had been caught attempting to cheat to gain an advantage. At the end of the day not everyone is held to the same standard, these esports drivers are held to higher standards because they publicly represent several brands. That's just how the world works. The more eyes that are on you, the greater the scrutiny will be. I would much prefer iRacing over react than under react here. The optics are just better."
"I agree the whole team should have had the same punishment, but disagree about it being too long.

This community is constantly asking for more severe punishments for breaking rules. So iRacing go ahead and actually do it and now you are complaining that its too long???"
"I feel like 1 year was fine. Spetz did something he 100% knew was cheating, while driving in a broadcasted race (thereby bringing iRacing into disreput), gained an advantage, and had prior punishments for other wrongdoing. Take away some of those aggravating factors and you probably don't end up with a 1 year ban."
"Too severe?? Seriously?
That wxplains why some people think they can get away with everything.
That arrogant little shit got nothing if it was just one year."
1 year was fine but permanent would have been ok too
"Will never be welcomed back IMO, he's just going to do better at hiding it now. Cheating fucks never stop especially when he was warned multiple times. The whole Williams team should not be able to compete in iRacing special events anymore"
[deleted]
"I could not agree more with this. I really do feel as if the ban to ""make a statement"" to the community was a pretty weak response to the whole ordeal. And Alx being made the scapegoat for this issue wasn't ideal either. Definitely glad he's back."
1 year ban was way too much. Surprised he even wants to come back
The community =/= OP
"Punishing the entire team because someone affiliated with you did something dumb seems VERY unfair as there’s no hard evidence to say the idea of driving on the apron was even suggested by anyone else in the team, Spetz could’ve just gone rogue and done it himself 🤷🏼‍♂️

Banning a whole team would be like banning the entire Mercedes F1 because Hamilton forgot to go to parc ferme"
[removed]
People who are habitual cheaters won't stop because of a ban. (or two) I know a guy who has bought at least 5 Escape from Tarkov accounts because he just can't stop cheating. It is a flaw in their personalities that they have to work on before they can truly stop.
"In no way was Spa worse than Daytona. Spa was in the open, everyone knew about it. In this case they hid the screen to hide it. It shows knowledge of guilt."
"Terrible analogy. The whole team would be watching his onboard and seeing what he was doing. So even if they didn't know he was planning on doing it, they saw him do it and said nothing."
"think about how spetz got to the point of actually driving the apron like that though.  its not an in the moment, fuck it, kind of thing.  that level of team has spent quite a bit of time fine tuning a race and a qualy setup which leads to quite a number of laps from different people that are going to get compared through telemetry like motec. every single person on the team knew that was going to be the plan from the jump and i guarantee you that it was discussed and at the least the majority were in favor of it, but most probably i would think it would be everyone. in addition to the fact that it wasnt his first offense, he obviously knew it was against the sporting code which is why he switched the camera to not show his on screen driving during qualy.  plus the fucking idiot livestreamed it.  imo spetz should have had a perma and the rest of the team the one year."

 I hit my 13th anniversary on IRacing last week.  As a lifelong Motorsport and performance car enthusiast, the thrill that comes with competitive races vs real people never goes away!"
"A win after only four races is impressive imo! Keep up the good work, see you on the track!"
"Congrats on your first win ! 
If you are an F1 enjoyer you might be a bit disappointed with Iracing, as the F1 plits are usually empty. You'll find communities that are active but only on certain moments of the week.
Here it's more about Super Formula and Indycar ! My advice : try different classes of racing and find the ones that suits you the most. I also started with open wheeler but stuck with multiclass prototypes as I had so much fun there.

Also, your next wins might be harder to achieve; when your Irating gets more accurate, you'll often find yourself in the midpack, unless you are one of those aliens. For me it's a good thing, a podium finish is far more rewarding when it doesn't happen every other race.

Have fun and maybe see you on track!"

"You can adjust the FFB level on the F9 black box page, and hit \`Auto\` after about 3/4 of a lap. The Auto option is also assignable as button / hotkey under controls. *(Was recently add a new mappable control)*"
"A bit off topic but, the reason I don't use custom controls per car is because if I make a change that I want applied globally to all cars it's a pain. For instance, if I need to recalibrate my pedals I have to do it for every car separately. 

Am I missing something, is there a better way?"
"Yep, so long as this is set, which you must have already to set different buttons per car, then any changes you make to FF are for that car alone. "
Oh? Good tip. Thanks.
How often are you recalibrating your pedals?
"Yeah, not often but it does happen. In the past year:

I adjusted the brake force needed for trail braking. I'm still tweaking it a bit.

I also had to replace the spring for my throttle load cell, which required re calibration.

Before that it was when I got new pedals.

Each time I've had to manually copy/paste the X,Y,Z values across all of the cars I use. Not the end of the world but I wondered if there was a better way."

https://youtu.be/RK6kE0ftFA0?si=p-Xf3zeT-sdygSPD (a good video if you are unfamiliar with the technique)"
"I went from years of Mazda mx5 into to the cayman gt4. Was quite a bit of a learning curve as I could not get the car to rotate at all.  I went from a 5500ir mx5 driver down to a 3000ir gt4 driver. 

For the mx5 I would use the throttle to rotate the car.  For the Gt4 I had to learn how to use the brakes correctly. Really need to ramp up pressure initially and trail off brake in gt4. Sometimes u just need 2-5% brake pressure to keep rotating the car. I say it took me about 100 races to finally get the hang of gt4.  Happy to report my irating back up to 4700.  Tough for me to break into 5000ir here.  The number and high level of drivers have greatly increased in gt4."
"the brake pedal will shift the weight onto the front tires and help you turn the car 


trailbraking 101, it's a good car to get the hang of it "
"Interesting that you're having issues because I called the Cayman a big Miata. 

You probably need to learn trail braking.  Caymans love it."
"Sounds like you went through the same thing as me. Eventually I want to be racing the pcup, so I wanted the gt4 to learn a heavier car in the mean time."
"Man. I just dont see it lol. With mazda I could introduce a bit of oversteer easily and confidently control it.

With this car, I can't get it to oversteer without completely losing it."
Dude I tried Gt3 recently and I was a noob all over again. After 500 laps of Daytona practice I still could not get it. Good luck man.
"Not sure what to say. Porsche GT4 is probably the second most tossable car for me after the Miata. 

Setup? Brake bias? Trail braking?"
I'm averaging a 1:15.7 at sandown this week. Which is like 2 second off of a top split pace. This thing is crazy difficult to master lol
"I did F4 Fixed last season and I have no idea what people mean by “horror story”. Yeah there are going to be plenty of wrecks, and some of them will be due to stupidity, of which I both caused and received. I learned a lot, moved up in the splits and grid, and had a lot of fun."
"Have you thought about the 1600 Trophy series? 

I can’t recommend this series enough. It is the best open wheel series on Iracing by far and usually a good atmosphere to race in. 

The numbers are also good. Only very rarely do they not get enough entries. 

The reason why F4 is a horror show is because too many people move to it without fully grasping many concepts of open wheel and racing in general. 

Any bad habits you have now will only be amplified the higher you go and the more faster and complex cars you drive.

If you can become a consistent midfield split 1 driver in 1600 trophy before you move on to F4 or other aero cars it will do you the world of good in the long run."
USF is a lot cleaner and the ovals are more fun than I thought they would be
"don't let the crybabies with no racecraft or incident avoidance skills scare you away from F4 if its what you want to do 


it's super easy to grind irating in F4, just be aware of the cars around you"
"F4 in challenge series not clean. Mostly is because car is hard to drive and people haven't skill for it. First two laps many times turn in wreckfest on cold tires. Then you can have many laps battle for position, clean and respectful. But one or two your or other player mistake an equal to end of the race. Even with one fast repair. 20 min races every hour if you will racing in fixed and open in same time.

Every season 4-5 subscription tracks and other paid.

F4 Regional tour Europe North 9 out of 10 races is clean. I can't say about other 3 regional tours. All this regional tours have only 8 races at week, people trying to be clean and respectful, level if participation much higher.
Every tour have his own schedule and every season schedule have a same tracks but configs can change. Same duration of race — 20min."
If you race in the evenings in eu or usa go usf if you are after clean racing. The car is also way more fun to drive(more power/less downforce).
Some tracks are bad in f4. But it’s not horror. Get into higher splits and it’s not as bad
"F4 is actually really fun, I highly recommend it.

The cars are pretty easy to drive, high participation, and it gets scheduled some great tracks.

You'll come across bad drivers (I really don't understand how so many people cause wrecks at Spa, it's so easy in an F4), but it's worth it overall IMO."
"USF2000 is, IMHO, significantly better than F4. Some issues do happen, and it’s far less popular. And often doesn’t split so you’ll be in with drivers probably much much faster than you. But it is much, much cleaner than F4."
"USF2000 is great if you can avoid bottom split or races without a split. Class D drivers with very low iRatings are basically rookies, possibly worse."
Formula 4 is easy peasy
"Honestly hadn't considered it much, I assumed it was just an extension of the rookie. What makes it different from the rookie level? 

And thanks for the suggestion!"
It’s also very possible to have a bad USF lobby. One week at Oulton Park I had 8x on the formation lap.
And Formula Ford is an interesting option because there are usually multiple splits.
"Open set ups

Different tracks

Cleaner driving

Don’t feel that because cars like the 1600 and MX5 have rookie classes that you shouldn’t be racing them once you get out of rookies. 

They are great cars that people should be driving for longer than a few weeks.

Definitely not Rookies when the top drivers in it are 8K plus IR."
I'm not afraid to admit open set up scares the hell out of me! I know just enough to make big mistakes.
"Start learning.

Have a test session.

Pick a setting put it to the minimum run a few laps then put it to the maximum run a few laps and the note what handling changes you felt. 

Then pick another. 

Only 1 setting at a time. 

It’s actually good fun. 

Just run a standard set up for racing for now. They’re pretty good anyway. Once you get some confidence you can start playing around."
I used the fixed setups in D class 1600 and raced just fine.
Just download a setup they are readily available
"Cool, didn't know that."
Majors garage for set ups or join Garage 61
Maybe watch the replay and think how you could have avoided the contact /s
Looks like someone is doing the 12pm EST race 😬
Luckily there’s a next session
This is why I stay in the back whenever I do endurance races. At least til the field singles out a bit
"Bro, are you playing Cruisin USA? No wonder you wrecked, use the in-dash view and you would have seen it comin in your mirrors."
What happened to the Caddy? They get punted or just lock up?
"Hey pretty sure we're in this split, got lucky on avoiding this a couple spots back. If you're on the Black Panthas team and reading this, politely never join an LMDh race again 🥰🥰🥰"
"Safe to say, that was not the accident I expected when I saw two cars side by side there."
Got similar but at the first horseshoe in GTD
5 second penalty for Ocon next question
"Wait this race is 24 hours long?
How does that even work everyone stays up for 24 hours?"
You're like a character on Star Trek wearing a dreaded red Enterprise shirt who always gets killed at the beginning of an episode.
"I started my D24 stint and had no FFB.  Couldn't fix it, would have DQed without my fair share and so we dropped out.  Asking VRS forum and they helped me troubleshoot.I have a kill switch and it must have gotten accidentally pushed today.  Was working this morning.  I am not sure if your story is more depressing or mine.  This was our second D24 session. First one one of our drivers hit the wall and was un-repairable...  I guess pain is how you learn to master D24."
I came in like a wrecking ball 🎶
Shoulda checked your mirrors /s
Better to have it happen sooner rather than put all the time and effort in only to be destroyed during the last few hours
Do you not have mirrors turned on???? VERY avoidable.
That’s racing my guy. Sometimes you get the shit stick
"I love seeing this tbh.   Sorry not sorry.

I just find it funny people dont know how to start a race."

Or.

""Read the sporting CODE!"""
Dude seriously? That’s it? He should avoid contact from idiots like this?

11am*
This is probably the reason the cars behind were racing so hard lap 1. No repercussions for that. They just go to the next one lol
There’s always NextSession™️
"Lol I did this in the ROAR.  Worked my way up to 9th when the guy in P8 turned P7 ***on the backstretch***, sending them both careening off the wall into me."
It really sucks that it's almost necessary to start at the back to avoid the risk of being taken out on lap one in a 24h race. Even in bottom split this shouldn't be an issue.
That was my plan for the Roar.  I was also way off pace in the LMP3.  Lap 5 guys get into a crash in T1.  I e goes does a donut right in the middle of the track and two others come onto the track from the right all crashing again and I got caught up in it.  6 minutes of required repairs five laps into a 2 hour and 20 minute race.
">Cruisin USA

Man, that brings back some great memories."
Checkpoint!!!!!!
"OOO AHHH OOO, AHH AHH OOO AHHH OOO YEAAA"
Got punted
Multiple drivers per car
"""My guy"" makes me cringe every single time."
you missed the /s tag...
"Downvoted for not knowing what /s means. Reddit at its finest 😂

/s stands for sarcasm"
Not everyone can just do the next race.  People are just idiots and only thing about needing to pass the next car ASAP.  They don't think about the long game
Double tap the gas pedal
Bummer. Good luck in the next attempt
"Ah okay, that’s why everyone wants a team n shit. Everything makes sense now."
That sounds like a you problem. 
"okay, my guy"
And here i was thinking the /s is unnecessary.
"I think, people will downvoite you for this comment.

And me too for my comment 😂"
Yeah when you're organizing a bunch of guys for 24 hours that's hard as hell

"Keep it up, you’re doing well. We’re expecting a podium finish."

This is less than optimal
“The leader’s coming up on you. They’re not our fight.”
Push push push! we can catch this car…
"The next car is pitting. 




The next car is pitting."
"Alright, we're about to go green"
“Better schedule some testing.”
Thanks Jim
“They say you cut the course”
Would you get in trouble if you drew a dick?

Thats always the most demoralizing message
"There’s a couple of tracks where you kind of clip pit entry regularly when lapping. And he gets so annoying through those. “The car in front is pitting. The leader is into the pits. The car behind is pitting.”

No they’re not you dingus they’re just pit-adjacent."
Who say that?
Stg people downvoting for a joke![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)seems like half the reddit iRacing community are 5 yrs old.
"To be fair, depending on the lobby that could be a podium"
One I hear more often than not 😂
The iracing crew chief does when you get a slowdown warning
"Lol yes I was trying to be sarcastic, unfortunately written chat makes it hard 😂"
"My split was a shit show, 4k SOF for GTP and GTD and a whopping 993 SOF for LMP2. This was my first endurance race on iRacing, i truly hope this is a one off. 

0.2k and 0.4k LMP2 drivers that were slower than GT3 drivers through the corners."
The LMP2's in our split where also around the 0.5k /1.5k mark and where an absolute menace. Eventually got murdered by two on the banking while we where leading with 9 hours to go. Why the fuck did I grind irating to get away from those muppets to then still be pitted against them in an enduro. It's cruel.
"Fair one.  I love LMP2 but stopped doing multiclass in them when I as a 1.5k ended in a race with 10k GT3 drivers, including that controversial Sven bloke.  I have never felt so out of place. Even in the LMP2 class there were 7 and 6k drivers.  I just got pasted.  


On the other hand.  Low ir doesn't mean unsafe."
"As a decent enough lmp2 racer of old (3+k & now enjoying some single seater this season) I know your pain. Having raced in splits with 6k to 0.6k drivers, it’s a bit of a mess. You have good guys to race but have to deal with the intentional wrecking dumbasses. It’s why I stopped. We need a new gen P2 to get participation back up"
Top splits only got like 12 GT3s...
Tell us something new
0.2k is pathetically impressive
"Had the same in our split. We were Session 2 Split 4. LMP2 SoF was 1.2k. There was a 300iR LMP2 driver who was slower than GT3s through the bus stop every time I encountered him. At one point there was this dude named Hector and every time we approached him, he crashed or spun. Literally every time. I was telling our driver to watch out for him and less than 3 seconds later Hector locks up in front of us, goes off track, then rejoins and crashes into us. Fortunately repairs were very minor and didn’t cost us time but it just made me laugh."
"I feel you, made many clips to report. Currently leading but they almost took us out 3 times already. It takes away every seriousness about this platform and event."
"Being fast and doing that safe is different then being slow and safe. Getting to A is easy, staying there is not. Thats why we get the crashes due to difference in speed."
The LMP2 we have is the current gen. New LMP2s aren't scheduled to be a thing until at least 2026 IRL.
"The GTP and LMP2 are similar in character, so people mostly just drive the one that’s got more competition going on at the time (not really a surprise when LMDh use LMP2 chassis with the same assists). People will flock to whichever is most popular to follow the crowd and get the best races.

When we just had the BMW, it was GTP that was dead and LMP2 was super popular. Now that we have 4 good GTPs it’s that that’s super popular - and the LMP2 which is dead."
We were split 4 and got 15. 8 of them retired. We had 12 LMP2s. 8 retired. 20 GTPs and I think 5 retired. More than half the field was dead by like hour 15.
"Not like they do it on purpose. They didn't choose to be placed in one of the top splits, it just happened to them."
"It's rough when you put hours of practice into something and then get taken out by someone who doesnt seem to care about the race at all. At the end it's a game but ya know, still hurts."
It’s current gen but nobody IRL drives it bc the Oreca 07 has been so dominant. I wish we had the Oreca… it’s such a pretty car too.
Yah I know and I really hope iRacing get early access like we did with the M4 to build a bit of hype. But yah wishful thinking I know.
"Kind of funny that I really enjoy the lmp3 and lmp2, I mean the roar in the P3 was a glorious drive. however I have the bmw but just don’t enjoy driving it, even after the others have come and it’s been updated I still use it off line to se if my feel improves in it. Any idea which gtp feels closest to the P3 and p2 to try?"
[deleted]
"I think we were in the same Split, my team took pole in gt3 and we were leading for the first 10 hours or so until one of those lmp2 guys decided it was a good time to forget how to make a turn"
He might have tanked it on purpose. 0.2k is wild
GAME?!
"Would the Oreca make any real difference? IRL, the Oreca chassis surely is better than the Dallara, but I fail to see that having any effect in iR."
No idea but I regret buying the bmw. Wish I got a different p1
Yup session 2. We were talking about how dead the track was at times but then it was like everyone was on the same side at the same time. It was just cycling back and fourth.
Ahh you were the Cookie Monster team.
Je didn't OP specifically said he was extremely slow
I fucked up..
I just like it because it looks nicer than the Dallara to me lol. They wouldn’t just let it be better than the Dallara.
"Lmao, very true. I can tell I was tired last night 😂"
"Check if your router hasnt got a daily reset timeslot, especially in the night hours"
"My iracing app froze and crashed . Lost us 3 laps. Later my Internet went down. Another 3 laps. 

This is why we don't need iracing to add random mechanical failures to the sim."
I think this happened to one of Team Redlines cars as well. They ended up getting randomly disconnected
I got disconnected in hour 3 of the race and that never happened in iracing before. My guess is the servers couldn’t handle the amount of people
"I never lost WiFi, stayed connected to discord through the whole event. Had to be iracing."
"Was exactly my case, not even a disconnection sound on discord. Yet iR took a minute to find the connection, while I was talking to my buddies.

My case it was the router and I swapped the hours, so didnt have any problems in D24"
Damn. Thanks for the info. I’ll be sure to check now and make sure I don’t have it happen again
"Mu understanding is that until the green lights, the field has to wait for p1 to go. If p1 wants to go as soon as the pace car goes in, they can. Once the green lights are on, everyone is free to race."
"Go when the leader goes after the safety car comes in. Don't pass the car directly in front of you until you see the green lights, or you'll get a black flag."
"I'm the Rolex car, and had a view of the leaders so I was basing accelerate decisions on that. The leader doesn't really accelerate until the start line, so I was hesitant to go early. I also didnt want to pass the left line positions pre-green, i assumed i'd get a penalty. 

Clearly the people around me were less patient. I finished p6 so it was a solid race, but I was surprised no one around me got a penalty because I qualified p10, and dropped to p18 or so after this.

I did read the sporting code and it mentions a lot of passing on the left, but i couldn't really figure out how to process this start.

&#x200B;

I do realize it was a bad start from me overall, but it was all the pre-green flag passing that I am not sure about."
Depends on when the green came out.
"Simple answer is the red car went awol and the car next to you built off of it. If you had slid up behind the white car after red gunned it you would have been ok, but red could have darted back and taken you both out. Most important thing is not getting collected by nutjobs"
"1) All cars must stay behind the safety car and maintain their position

2) The lead car cannot cross the start/finish line before the safety car crosses (extending the start/finish line to the pitlane). This is where a bit of mind games can happen as the lead car controls the pace.

2) all cars must maintain their position until the lead car crosses the line (green light when lead car crosses), and they can't excessively slow"
"On the last page of setting up a test drive, you can disable automatic track state generation and set a specific percentage of wear (40% would be good).

In general, for slick tracks you want to use less throttle, or try to avoid going through the slick parts at all."
Thank you!
"at least you made it 6.5hrs in before you got killed

We made it 2 corners before we got [bonked](https://www.twitch.tv/yaydanman/clip/FriendlyFuriousVultureAMPEnergyCherry-piSz0g1PiUg6jWRr)"
"I came two behind 2 GT3s fighting last night in a regular IMSA race in this exact spot. I had the GTP I was racing right behind me. I waited behind them, the guy I was racing sent it and locked up and hit the wall. I carried on and passed them going into the outfield.

It's honestly wild how wrapped up racing other people get that they just get tunnel vision and forget about everything else."

I’m starting to think that the guys that drive prototypes shouldn’t be racing at all
Sorry about that awful luck! Still awesome to get that far!
"There should be a Guess the SOF game. Show a clip of someone being a moron and you have to guess the SOF. 

I'd say 1.4k on this one."
"Same thing happened to Basic Ollie. Just came out of the pits and was on the infield starting his second stint when a protype, driving like an assbag, clipped him and sent him straight into the wall."
Ah yes. The old ‘I’m going to win this 24hr endurance at turn 2’ divebomb. Classic
We got smacked in the butt braking for T1. Thankfully only optional repairs. That would have SUCKED.
Generalizing won’t help
I want to say that iRacing has a prototype problem. What you said is true and it makes IMSA such a crap shoot.
Way way high!
"I watched the incident with Ollie and it seemed like a racing incident to me. He came out of the kink and for some reason, maybe fatigue, didn't move to the left side of the track like the GTP was expecting, and like GT3s always do in that corner. I watched the replay a couple times and his steering wheel was completely straight when he was on the right side/inside of the track. I'm pretty sure if he was driving the GTP in that scenario he would have been cussing out the GT3 for not sticking to the racing line (which would be on the left side). That being said of course it's ultimately on the GTP for rear-ending him and the GTp should expect potential awkwardness in that section considering the high closing speed. It's always a lot more ambiguous than people want to think it is."
"That whole series of corners is a vortex of danger and the left hander before seems to be particularly bad for netcode. Last year we got glued to a passing car dragged sideways and deposited into the barrier.

These things unfortunately happen (if you watch the real race it’s not uncommon for big shunts to happen here in reality). I just found it somewhat amusing that the driver attempted to blame me despite braking about 10m from the apex. Tbf I wish I could have done something about his driving…"
"Yes, you are right. 

However, it is a lot of car and when there is a lot of car there must be higher respect. Perhaps a higher license requirement may be in order for these special events. Maybe an average amongst team members similar to real life Pro-am if you will."
I was tempted to go higher based on some of the dumb shit I saw in 2nd split of the Friday race. 4k SOF in GTs. Only 5 survived to the finish.
"I'd agree with you, but after seconds of a slower class not moving, I would have taken the hint. Driver behind didn't even think about braking early, just plowed straight into him.

Add onto that there wasn't even a single apology just shows what a douch that driver is"
"I’m not really sure if raising the license requirement would solve it. IMSA is A class and it’s not much better either.

My problem with always generalizing and just saying all prototype drivers are shit is that, even if most people don’t realize, a lot of the incidents are on both people. GT drivers blocking intentionally or unintentionally because they’re not looking at their mirrors, driving in the middle of the track, or trying to be nice and going off the racing line out of a corner that only makes the situation worse, are the catalysts for a lot of these incidents. Yes, the prototypes shouldn’t send it into gaps that don’t exist and should just wait a corner in most cases, but to say they’re always solely to blame is just not true. A lot of slower class drivers have to remember that it’s in their interest too that the faster class passes easily and safely too"
Absolutely fantastic points. I don’t disagree with a word you said.
IMSA is fine when you get to the higher irating. Sure incidents happen but not near as bad as the lower splits.
Hahaha idk why it took so long for these to become shooting star memes

"Networking is complicated, and the issue can be anywhere between your computer and IRacing servers. ""checking your internet connection"" may not even test the same path your data takes when talking to IRacing, so you don't have a good way to rule out problems on your side or with your isp.


It's unlikely to be an issue with IRacing, but if it happens often, you should talk to your isp and have them give you more details on where the disconnect is initiated. "
"> The only thing weird was that it wasn't checkered and I saw that so I kept driving, then it disconnected.

Sounds like the actual disconnection had occurred before you crossed the line, but iRacing at your end allowed you to continue on while it tried to reconnect (like what happens to people when the blink/disappear).

I had a circuit breaker trip a few nights ago that killed my router, but it didn't boot me out of iRacing until 20-30 seconds later."
Sounds like an internet issue.
"Thanks, you're probably right."
I guess but I'm in America on West servers and the race was on EU servers or at least everyone from there had a better connection and anyone from the US has a worse one. Idk maybe my Internet likes to crap it's pants when it knows I'm going to win.

Stick to one series for a season sounds like it may be lack of confidence in a single car - pick something you feel most comfortable in and stick to it for a full season.
"I used to get nervous around other cars then i tried oval racing, theres no where to hide there and you do get comfortable around other cars. 
The biggest thing is to communicate what you are going to do prior to the corner, eg hug the inside line if you have a car close as most dont have the skill to overtake on the outside or if you dont want to switch lines tap the brakes to indicate you are going to brake soon. 
Going back to basics is probably needed too, theres a great course on coach Dave which is cheap, just suit for a month or if youre really keen Suellios motor racing checklist is more in depth"
"This is going to sound silly, but remind yourself that the race doesn’t matter. If you crash, it doesn’t matter, there’s more races. Actively remind yourself that it’s supposed to be fun and don’t go into the race so focused on getting a result and avoiding lap 1 disasters."
"Biggest thing I'd suggest is running one series and getting properly to grips with that car/track. It usually takes me an hour of pracitice to get up to a semi decent pace, and then probably 5-10 races to understand how to approach racing on the track/where to overtake/best defensive lines etc. 

If you fancy jumping back into the mx-5, I'd be happy to take a look at your driving and give you some pointers, I havent tried doing any coaching before, but im curious to try and see if i can help. Think we could get you your first win easily within a month! 

 I'd offer to help in other series, but I haven't ventured out of mazdas myself yet, sitting around 4.5k rn with a handful of top split wins under my belt. 

You'll get there man, sometimes it just takes someone else to pinpoint the mistakes/give you that aha moment. 

Out of curiosity, what wheel/pedals are you running?"
"Go race whatever your most favorite car or series has ever been in your 4 year career and have fun. Go rediscover what youve enjoyed racing in the past and get back into a positive headspace, then work on improving what you've been struggling with."
"I don't mean this derisively, but after 4 years maybe you've had your fill and it's time to move on to a different hobby. Interests can change over time. Doing something you don't find fun just because you've invested money is, in my opinion, the worst thing you can do. There's a reason it's called the sunk cost fallacy.

For example, I used to watch a lot of movies. Now no movie interests me anymore, it feels like I've already seen everything I would want to see. So I do other stuff. Maybe the interest will come back."
"Just stop. Have a break. Sim racing is not your life. Forcing yourself into it when you’re not enjoying it won’t help. This applies for all hobbies in life. They come and go, your passion for them comes and goes. It’s ok to not enjoy it and give it a break, try something else. You’ll come back to it when you’re ready and I guarantee when you have that enjoyment back, you’ll improve your rating."
"I would go back to MX-5 rookies. Practicing alone isn't going to help you with racecraft. You have to be racing with other cars on the track, passing and being passed."

"You need to race more if you want to learn how to win.

Being able to lap quickly is only part of the picture."
"I would suggest to do more races and less practice.
You said you can go around the track for full race length, which is step 1 in the learning process imo.
The 2nd part of learning is driving around track with others and all of the shenanigans that come along with it.

Your irating will go down probably at first, but after a while you will get more comfortable and less insecure in the races, and you will start gaining again.

The feeling of some form of anxiety driving around others will change into a feeling of adrenaline for battling those same drivers."
"Go race something in a different discipline: oval, road, or dirt road. Then you won't care about your iRating at all and it might even be fun!"
Have you tried some of the online coaching?  Practice may not mean much if you’re not sure what you’re practicing for.
"If you are DQing from more than 1 race in a row the problem is not everyone else it is you - bad luck doesn't constantly happen it might just be you.  


You have to learn to drive around other people and be fast. That's racing if you can't ou can't... If it isn't fun try something else. You need to be fueled by passion and dedication.. Or you just want to have fun.. DCing 8 times in a row is not fun and probably involved in ruining others fun too."

"man i did this once when a friend convinced me to get the IR18 when it was at le man 2 weeks back, so i jumped in and figured id just sit behind him during his race to get a feel for it (as the race had already stated)  
the ghosting is nothing like in practice, they dont become transparent, they stay full solid......scared the shit outta me when another drive went straight through me.....yea never again ey"
"Yeah that's super fair tbh, I think I find the fun in sim racing comes from different places to most people. For me if im off the pace/struggling to be quick I get super demoralised, which is why I suggested having someone else look at ops driving try to help them see how improve more efficiently. But I get everyone is different/finds joy in different forms in this hobby, so it definitely might not be the right advice for OP."
"Protest this, you did nothing wrong"
"Not your fault at all mate. The guy in front made two moves in an attempt to defend, when he should only really be making one (although I'm not sure this is officially a rule in iracing, someone correct me if im wrong). The first move he made was just about okay, although it was still ""reactionary"". The second move is blatantly blocking, and is absolutely protestable. The only thing you did wrong was be faster than a sore loser ;)"
"That’s A ban. He attempted to defend the first. You went and he was late and pushed you off track, that’s not defending"
"Ready, thanks!"
"To clarify the one move ok two moves bad thing is an F1 rule not an iRacing rule. In racing you can only make one move if it’s before the other player makes it. ie if you hold your line coming out of the corner and then block someone, that’s against code"
"Thanks, I understand some things reading their answers"
"The first move was not a big problem for me, but pushed me to the forest was trully unnecessary, i mean, i don’t think i could beat him after i touched the grass"
"Preemptive = yay  
Reactive = nay"
"Yeah that makes sense, I remembered hearing this but never fully memorised the specifics. Although it's never really sat right with me. I'm super fine with the car in front moving after I've moved, so long as its not so late that I'm having to take avoiding action to not rear end them. I've always considered that good hard racing/ enjoy forcing a car to defend by faking a move to the inside etc, something that would never really happen if the rules were followed to the letter of the regs."
"> holding my line

> on a path that is closing

two opposite things honestly, either you're holding your line or you're closing the gap. This corner isn't like the kink where the GT3s need to take the apex. 


You have a part in creating this situation. You have 2 GTPs side by side behind you at T1, both close enough to try a move into that fast right/left. On the exit you stay tight, denying the orange caddy and allowing the red one to get a run. Despite that, you then try to take the racing line, turning into the red one who was now committed to the gap you signaled earlier. I am aware i'm speaking with hindsight, but i think you had time to react to move. Was it aggressive by the red caddy? Absolutely. Was it reasonable given your position at the exit of T1? also yes.

What you should have done in this situation is to pick one side (line) and stick to it. You picked left out of T1, then switched over to right and got punted as result. If you would have stayed left, there wouldn't have been an issue.

To answer your question: Is it protestable? I don't think so, you are as much at fault as the GTP imo. Probably even more, but that might be my bias as prototype driver speaking"
No. There’s no proof of intent in this video.
"You had a GTP on either side, believe you are at fault here for lack of awareness"
"BMW is at fault as didnt leave enough room for the GTP.

He was fully along side you and you were still trying to take the normal line."
There is honestly more chance of you being successfully protested than the other guy here.
"Causes wreck: Is this reportable?

Now I’ve seen it all. Thanks for the chuckle"
"Yes the red car should definitely protest the GT car for trying to force him off the track.

You're only supposed to hold your line if another car isn't already there. If crew chief says ""car right"" do not go to there.

The fact that this needs to be said explains a lot about the low driving standards."
"When signing up you confirmed and checked a little check box to confirm you've read the sporting code.

I'd highly recommend taking 10 minutes to actually read it to avoid looking like an ass in future.

Also: username checks out"
"Reportable for what? Unless there’s some massive fighting beforehand that we don’t see, it looks unfortunate but not malicious. 

The BMW left the right side open in the exit of turn one and by this point of the race they should be expecting the GTP to continue there especially with their pace. 

It’s not a great place for a pass but with two GTPs apparently fighting behind you should know that they’re going to do anything to get past the BMWs"
"I would say next time even if they are trying 3 wide on you, pick a side quick and don’t stay in the middle.

Yeah you might make someone lose time, but that is multi class racing and you’ll stay alive 🤷🏻‍♂️

For this one in particular, if you see the black line on the floor, you are actually swapping racing line, so I’m afraid this one might be on you 😅

PD: when I say racing line, is not the usual racing line of that track, is racing line of multi class with another class trying to pass you."
honestly i think you had to be more clear about your intent. Most gtd on the 24h race were coming to right side more or less following the racing line and letting space on the left. You wer just in the middle
No.
"Pick a side. You left both doors open and got upset when one of the cars went through a door. Re-watch that guys cockpit view again, he doesn't see you wanting the space, he sees you giving it to him."
You are the car that lead to this incident happening unfortunately. I have to pick a side and stick to it. They are going to try and pass.. So let one you basically blocked caddy and then cut off red
"Hey, ok, it was op fault IMO but why are you so rude with him?"
"You weren’t very clear on where you wanted to go, you left room on the exit and then moved in to close it."
"Nothing to protest here, just a typical BMW driver driving like he owns the road and hasn't heard of mirrors yet"
Yes it can be protested…..against you. Stay in your line.
"that’s tough, the gt3 probably didn’t know which gtp was going to go and once he picked a line it was the wrong one"
All the truths here.
This is the right take. And I agree. Nothing to protest here.
"I knew there were there, left the space for inner gtp, outside guy was going into a closing anyway"
Yea but normally gtps are supposed to go inside??? Plus the other gtp i wanted to leave him space aswell
"This. A BMW in my race kept doing the same thing every single time we lapped him. Just hanging out in the middle of the track. Lackadaisically going from one side to the other. 

Always move with purpose in a multi class race. Get to one side or the other and stay there.  The time gained by diagonaling a straight is like a hundredth of a second. So not worth it.

And if at all possible put the passing car on the inside so you're not racing him through the corner and costing you both more time. It got to the point where I refused to go to the right after West horseshoe because this would always end with a side by side through t7. If the GT would just get to the right then we both cruise through t7 with very little time lost."
"I did stay in my line tf, its the gtps job to pass safely"
"7.4.2. In all cases, it is the responsibility of the faster car to safely overtake the slower car. **It is the responsibility of the slower car to maintain a consistent line. It is strongly recommended that a slower car being lapped makes every reasonable effort to facilitate a safe pass**  


If theres anything remotely reportable its yourself.  


Even going beyond the very basic racing rule of that you cant simply drive a car off the road. **You** made a apperently concious decision (by your admission you knew he was there) to turn into a faster class car in the middle of his overtake.  


Going bit further since this was apperently a concious decision its really intentional wrecking.  


YTA m8,  


Multiclass takes all classes playing nice to eachother to have a race. And getting passed is just as much a skill as overtaking is."
At no point did you leave a gap for the orange car.
"i have done countless races on daytona and i have never been overtaken in that spot on the inside. Always outside. Also reporting is for intentional wrecking or other malicious behavior. Its not meant for bad racecraft, which in this case actually comes from the GT3"
They go wherever they can based on what the GT3 is doing. You were on the inside so the outside was the clear option as there was a gap. You should have held inside as you would have needed to anyway for the horseshoe when they inevitably came through. The only time a prototype takes the inside here is if they got the inside as you exited T1. Otherwise they hold back for the inside for the horseshoe as it’s more optimal to get by you. Going around the outside of the horseshoe loses a lot of time.
"You kept it tight in turn one leaving a gap on the outside then closed in. Thats not staying in your line, that’s taking the racing line. You have a responsibility to make sure they pass safely as well.  Just take the L man and learn from it."
"Yep. Always outside. If only to give yourself an out of guys like GT don't know where to go. 

But really because it sets you up to be on the inside for international horseshoe."
Guy calling you out is an idiot
90% of people that bitch on voice chat are salty and doing whatever they can to not blame themselves
He’s just mad he sucks and is a pilon and needs to blame someone else to help his ego
You sure he wasn't talking to the guy that was beside him and might have tagged his back bumper?
Been called out for something I didn't do before. I guess this is another case of mixing up player names.
"What I see is that you aren't at fault for the crash, but you unnecessarily created the situation which resulted in the crash.

When you would have taken the usual racing line, you maybe would have interrupted their battle but that is to be expected in a multi class race.

But because you stayed on the outside, they unexpectedly had to overtake you already in turn 1 instead of after turn 3. So they had to change their lines mid turn and either the gtp in the middle corrected too much or the one on the inside not enough or both and with a little help of netcode your wrong decision (or maybe driving error?) resulted in the crash."
"You missed the racing line and went wide, creating a 3 wide situation, that's the fault I'm seeing on your part. "
i mean.. you failed to avoid it so...
"On the bright side you didn't lose much, hell you gained a stretch and poop break 😂"
The second car started going wide and the third car pitted the second. First car was unfortunately collected.
The inside GTP was carrying too much speed under braking and had a snap/understeer and had nowhere to go. Sure in multiclass youre supposed to keep your line but swinging very far-right into T1 at Daytona is usually a reasonable way to get out of the way if you are being blue flagged. Id say the GTP had the error and had nowhere else to go but directly into the LMP car due to an unfortunate timing. But saying he caused the whole situation is a bit unfair.
Why are we getting down voted so much? Don't all slower class drivers know that being predictable is better than trying to do a courtesy to those behind?
"For legalities sake, I see your point. My only question becomes “what do I do?” Park it in T1 till all GTP’s go back through?"
God forbid someone make a... mistake!
"So your argument is ""don't make a mistake"" and then when asked what to do if you make a mistake, your answer is ""don't make the mistake in the first place""? What kind of reasoning us that?"
"Please don’t drive anymore, especially on the street. Is he supposed to pull off the road into the grass? You know this is a race right? People aren’t going to part the seas , so you can drive past. If you can’t see the car that far ahead of you and judge the situation, you have no business passing people in a turn. Should lift and try again when it’s safer"
"I meant that he created a difficult situation not that he caused or is at fault for the crash.

I can't really see the inside gtp having trouble to control the car before the netcode contact with the other gtp happened, but that might be due to the short time he is visible in the clip before.

I also don't think it is a good or smart decision to go wide there to let *faster class* cars by that aren't even close to be side by side with you by the apex, especially when they are fighting. You are losing way more time than necessary and they suddenly have to adjust their line mid corner because they meet you at the exit instead of somewhere on the next straight."
Maybe because all the guys who understand this are still racing the 24h race?
Stay predictable and on the racing line as expected. It is their responsibility to safely pass.
"It was already stated going wide was done purposefully in an attempt to give the drivers behind room, but in effect crowded the track, doing the opposite."
"He is supposed to have stayed on the racing line in front of them and let them handle him, rather than doing something completely unexpected and entering both their blindspots (if they only have 1 monitor). I'm confused by your comments. Who should lift? Who wasn't seeing a car ahead? Who misjudged the situation? The car on the inside that could no longer see the unpredictable LMP2? The one in the middle having to quickly adjust and try to give room?"
"That I know is legally true, though I feel like if left up to the GTP fields I’d be best just buggering off and not being in their race period. While today was a new low, I’ve been run over plenty of times by GTP’s IN TOP SPLIT TOO"
">but in effect crowded the track

?? It is the responsibility of the passing car to make it safely. If you can't pass a car taking a wide line then more practice is needed."
"Ignore this guy. Going wide and staying wide is not a wrong, the people who spun each other into you are wrong."
"Did I say it wasn't the others fault? If the racing line would've been followed, this wouldn't have occurred. If the others didn't crash and spin, this wouldn't have occurred."
">If the racing line would've been followed, this wouldn't have occurred.

Yes but it didn't lol. Can't undo a small error. 

>If the others didn't crash and spin, this wouldn't have occurred.

Agreed, this is why I say OP/LMP2 was not at fault."
"I built a rig for the family over the holidays and have been racing for about 3 weeks now. Racing in VR is f\*cking awesome. A couple bass shakers are in the future plans.

When Iracing is down for maintenance you can test drive any car you have downloaded
Usually starts in the morning eastern time and there is also downtime during the season for hot fixes
I JUST saw that iracing will be down tomorrow at 8am EST and it reminded me of this post. That would be your best chance to get some testing in if the time slot works. Just download the cars you want to test out today.
"Doesn't that only happen once every 3 months, and usually at off hours to prevent service interruptions?"
"That figures, they do it on a work day. Thanks for the heads up though."
It stays up for 24h after season builds 
"Last Thursday there was a hot fix, maybe you'll get lucky sooner than you think. 

Sometimes the test server stays open for a few hours after the maintenance. Personally I was inpatient, so I just took the plunge and bought the 296 gt3. For the gt4 I did use the test server. 

Also, I try yo buy per 6 items, so 5 tracks +1 car for the discount. I use irbg.net to decide what tracks to get."
"Good to know. Was trying out the GR86 the other night, I think I can live with that series until the end of the season to try something else. The MX-5 just doesn't speak to me. It's not an enjoyable drive lol."
"Thanks for the tip. Was already tracking to the 6 items discount for sure. This late in the season kind of hard to find 6 to grab, especially with not knowing which car(s) I would even want haha."
Make sure to download all cars now. If they aren’t on you HDD you can’t test them when test server is up. 
Funny because I find the GR86 to be an awful car. 
That's a solid point haha.
Compared to the MX-5 fixed? It felt amazing lol.
The avg is lower then a normal gt3 avg😂
485x without a DQ is a definite problem. Were these guys driving backwards at that pace?
And yet by the minimal IR loss it looks like they still finished ahead of several other teams.
"The way that iRacing has decided to weight SR gains/losses always confounds me.  This person does 315 laps with 227 incident points and only loses 1.15 SR, 0.4 of which I'm assuming is the artificial jump they do past whole numbers.  So essentially -0.75 SR drop.  315 laps, 14 corners per lap, 4,410 total corners, or an incident point every 19 corners.

Yet here I did 208 laps with only 16 incident points, or an incident point every 182 corners.  Yet I only gained 0.33 SR, just because I was class A, over 4.0 SR already.

I get they have a business to maintain and driving away paying customers isn't ideal, but they give way too much of a leash to players lower on the license/SR totem pole, which seems kinda opposite of how it should be."
iR gain/loss in special events is always minor as there's enough entrants to place you in a SOF very close to your teams average. Then the losses are distributed between all your team based on drive time as well.  
"SR is calculated using the last ~2600 corners. Think of it as a conveyor belt that can only hold 2600 corners. As soon as you add the 2601st corner to the conveyor belt the oldest 1 drops off the other end.  It's not really a plus/minus thing in this instance. It's just wiping out the former SR and calculating it solely on their last 2600 corners. 

When the C license guy did 315 laps of an 11 corner track that's ~3400 corners so their entire SR is based on this one race. 

This chart explains how many corners per incident you're allowed. https://imgur.com/niHLxF1

Daytona on iracing only has 11 official corners (not 14). So your CPI is 143 for your 2288 corners. Which means you fall in between 4 and 4.99 as an A license.

The C license guy had 3465 corners with 227x so that's 15.5 CPI. But since it only uses the last 2600 corners we have no idea when he got those Xs. It was likely at the beginning since he's still 2.06 which means more Xs got wiped out and was left with barely over the 16.9 CPI threshold to have that 2.06 SR as a C license.

I did 303 laps with 21x so that's 158 CPI. But most of those were at the beginning of the race so they fell off the conveyor belt and never even registered (I think I got 2x total in my last 4 hours which was 138 laps). I'm an A license so I got a 4.99.

As to giving more leeway to those with lower license levels, of course they should have more leeway. They're not as experienced so they're more prone to Xs."
"This chart might help aswell

Amazing explanation 👏
"People are downvoting me for saying exactly what this chart shows.  The lower your SR, the more leniency you’re given."
"https://preview.redd.it/b9pu9z6ik0ec1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5487d3e60b9b97ab2095ae32fcf93f3b74f8d455

Look at the rating changes on my team."
Why wouldn't you get more leniency when you're newer?
"Ye its pretty much a curve of your average cpi that gets steeper as you gain more SR.

The chart just makes it easier to see how those round number plateaus work."
"Drop to a lower license then if all you care about is SR. 

What does it even matter?"
"Seems to me that’s when you should prove more that you’re safe.  It’s not a good business model though, gotta keep people paying.

Also not saying I’m right, I just find it weird."
I don’t really care at all.  I was just showing what other people are gaining or losing.   Just posted this for info.    Ratings don’t bother me much.   We were still competing at the end of the race.   I’m so happy with that.    All 4 of us were doing a team event for the first time.    Not too bad for a few endurance rookies.
Why would someone with less experience be held to a higher standard than those with more experience?
Because they should have the burden of proof due to their inexperience?  Not a hard concept to understand.
"Yeah that's not how life works. Beginners aren't held to the same standard as veterans. 

It's a little sad that you're so hung up on a number. Get less Xs next time and you'll get a 4.99 too."
"lol…I didn’t get hung up on anything, I thought we were having a normal conversation.  I’m sitting at 4.8 or something so don’t really care, if I were to ever drop down, it’s gonna be stupid easy to gain it back.

Just stating an opinion."

"Imagine having so much ego, you just absolutely cannot admit when you fuck up and took someone out with a stupid dive to the inside. ""You brake too early!"" Believing the opening lap of any race, let alone a 24h, has the exact same braking marks as when you're hot lapping.

Can almost guarantee that driver is the type to yell ""blue flag! Blue flag!"" over and over again."
Having faster pace is never justification to just plow in to the back of another car
"He's just a bad driver with 0 self-awareness. Why would anybody make a move like that so early in a 24-hour race. Maybe on the last lap, but I'd still say it was a bad move, even if it was last corner last lap for the win."
They probably just couldn’t see you. Car isn’t bright enough
Should still continue the race rather than quit out
"Unpopular opinion but no, you didn't brake unreasonably early. Maintaining a strong balance of traction and low momentum during the first lap is critical to preventing collisions. Yes, you could have safely been quicker but I'd report him for being an idiot. Bad move and awful decision for lap one."
Rule for lap one. Defend hard inside all corners even if I lose a spot or two.
"This split was a chaos

second (skip ahead if not fluent in finnish we had a discussion about the lmp2 driving that fits the rest of the clip): https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2038699892"
"If gap no longer for you go, racing are you driver still really?"
He’s the idiot flying into that corner
His line?
The 24 seconds of Daytona.
"Easily one of my biggest pet peeves is people who run into the backs of other cars and claim you “broke too early”

That just isn’t how it works. At all."
"Why be so aggressive on lap 1 of a 24 hr race?  Also, the bright blue/yellow car seems to have made it through just fine.  Did I miss something?"
"Its lap 1 bud, Tow, take the repair, get back out there. We started P8 got all the way to 1st, last lap of stint hit the tyres in T1 pit exit. 7m of repair after 8 hours and 4 laps down. We finished the race P3, and only 2 laps off the leader. ALOT can happen in a 24 hour race, dont write yours off after a silly thing like this. There is still time to be made."
"Until iRacing penalizes these types of things nothing will stop the dive bombers and lap 1 heroes.

My subscription has lapsed since December 13th and I feel more sane because of it."
"Yeah this was on him. He drove squarely into your vortex of danger, or whatever it's called. Right into your blind spot, not far alongside enough to pass, into a door that is in the process of closing.

Plus, early braking is absolutely expected on lap 1."
If you no longer go for a gap etc. etc.
Even if you flash your lights at them first? /s
He started behind so he definitely didn't have a faster pace in quali.
That's not a controversial opinion at all
"Op didn’t do anything wrong, but this is something they could do better. The if gap car people can’t if gap take you out if you don’t give them the gap"
"Yes, you can see OPs wing come flying into frame from the right toward the end of the clip"
"10 minutes of repairs. We've been doing these races for a decade now and we know we can win them, we have no interest running 6 laps down for 24 hours."
"Yeah, he braked responsibly on cold tires and to give some grace for anyone who loses it in that turn, which happens so often on lap 1."
I think there should be a real effort to constantly point out that Senna used that as a defense when he took out Prost on purpose. Not an actual racing move.
"I didn't think so but I saw a bunch of comments saying you were too early, which you really weren't. I'd rather give up a position or two to the car going around the outside than give up the traction and torpedo security of the inside line.

Definitely room to push that envelope safely but I usually do the same, just cutting off the inside more aggressively to dissaude a dive bomb."
I am confused as shit.  Is OP the turquoise car involved in the accident?  Or the blue and yellow car?  That wing looks like it was from the turquoise car…
"Then you have no interest in endurance racing. Writing yourself off in lap one is just pathetic, especially with the attrition of these races. Stick to sprints. You'll be far better suited ;)"
"It's probably the worst line ever, I hate it when people quote it in the wrong context."
"For sure. To your point he also later said he was wrong to make that move.

I just like to think that's what all these dudes are saying to themselves when they try to make a move from 5 places back and are surprised when the car didn't see them."
"Agreed. Only thing OP could have done was hug the curb, but that guy probably would have plowed into him anyways."
I am the turquoise one yes! Sorry I didn't realize there was another blue and yellow car in the clip lol
Yes turquoise
"I've done enough enduros in iRacing where I've run in the back to 
the finish. Now me and my teammates would rather do something else with our time if we're no longer in a competitive position.

No need to be an asshole, I can do what I want with my time."
All good lol.  But yeah you weren’t braking that early.  This idiot just decided to drive into the danger vortex on lap 1 of a 24hr race.  What was he even doing in that race lol
"You have the wrong mentality for endurance races my dude based on your comments. If that makes me an asshole for pointing it out, then fuck me, I'm an asshole, but you should still stick to sprints, because unless you're winning, you're not having fun, and if you're not having fun, you're dangerous, as I've seen from my own many year experience in endurance racing on Iracing. Except I'm there for the long haul, wreck in first hour or last hour...."
"[This you? *""We retired in the 1st hour as we went 18 laps down cause GT3 turned in when we were along side.""*](https://old.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/10ihfos/never_in_my_d24_history_have_i_seen_a_gap_like/)"
Aluzions has been real quiet after this. What a dumb comment from him when he obviously would have done (and had done) exactly the same.
"Haha, what a find

I'm totally with you. Yes, in endurance racing sometimes you have to deal with issues and slog through.

Getting major damage lap 1 is going to kill most people's mood to drive for 24 hours.

I'm sorry that guy treated a 24 hour race like a 15 minute sprint."
"I get their sentiment, but nothing takes the wind out of your sails like qualifying well and immediately being taken out. I've finished endurance races multiple laps down over a dozen times, I've had my fill of that and would rather do something else with my time if I can't compete at the front."
Damn... that was me following in the white Porsche. Scared the shit out of me when your car just vanished. Sorry it ruined your race
rip
Crazily we had 30 minutes of damage and it fixed everything. I think we were down a little on speed but one of our drivers really wanted to continue and he jumped back in and we ended up finishing with him. We had a good fuel saving strategy that was working for us too.
just finishing is half the battle. They made a change awhile back where if you do all the repairs car will be back to 100% which is nice.
It would be fair to rename this sub to /r/iCrashedNeedToVentButDontHaveFriends
I just went back to rookies to race Mazdas at summit point. It’s a mad house. Took a couple races to dial in my expectations.
"Someone just fucked up & got an earful 👀

Also, wrong flair."
"That's wrong. It should clearly be

/r/iCrashedNeedToVentButDontHaveFriendsAlsoWhatIsASportingCodeAndIAmARacingGodThatCantGetOutOfRookies"
Ok now I want to cry. A lot.
Nah I ran the D24 with a random (ISH) teammate and all they did was complain about other drivers and drive way too hard.
Probably auto flair because of the question mark
Sounds like time for you to find a team. I always hated running events with a random.
Do the tires lose grip quickly due to extra grease on them?
"I can't speak on the specific issue you're having, but it seems surprising to me that the steering is going light in such instances. I'd expect the opposite to happen, the steering should be heavier due to the increased weight over the front wheels. Someone feel free to correct me if im missing something there, but i think the logic is sound? Even though the steering should feel heavier, it is normal that the rear is lose/more likely to step out in the downhill braking zones like you say. I went from a g920 to a csl dd, but didn't really encounter this issue on either wheel. I'd say the main thing is making super sure you're not adding steering input and getting braking done in a straight line. It may be more that you're noticing the deadzone in the centre of the g920, where there is never really any feedback, and it's just effecting you more noticeably in these tricky braking zones?  My g920 always had about 5 degrees left/right of centre where there would be basically no ffb. This is inherent to the design of the wheel, and wouldn't be present in dd wheels."
"I suspect that what you're describing feels a lot like what you'd experience when going over a brow; the car feels incredibly light and twitchy at the rear.

Like others have said, avoid excessive steering input when this is happening."
I can’t speak to your specific use case but upgrading to a DD definitely got rid of a lot of the instances where I felt like my T300 was too toy like and not actually simulating the right forces through a corner.
G29 isn’t direct drive so not sure if you’re asking about how a direct drive feels or if you got your wording messed up
"If you are falling forward on your face and you get pushed from the side, will it be easy to catch your fall? 

The answer is no. It’s physics. Read a book, brush up on your high school physics and learn all of the forces acting on an object when in motion. I have the Xbox version of your wheel, the g920. You should only be braking at two corners on the down hill if you’re driving properly. Keep practicing. You will learn how to do it at Bathurst. You have to really think about every input to be in control of the car. 

If you cannot control the car on a course, you shouldn’t be trying to race at that courses keep practicing and really think about the implications of your movements and actions and how they would work IRL"
"I have a Simagic setup. Alpha line, gts wheel, P2000 pedals, and the D8XT shifter. It’s set on a next level wheel stand. 

The GT4 is one of the harder cars for me to drive (bmw). Many people set the max brakes at 80-85% because it’s hard to recognize when the abs is activated. 

Regardless I don’t feel any different driving the gt3 to the gt4 in the wheel at all."
"I have a simucube sport. Overall it does a good job, I haven't played with any settings but I think it goes up to 17nm on the high torque mode which I have enabled. During downhill sections when I break I can feel the steering get heavier to indicate the weight is over my front axles. I've never tried another setup so I'm not sure how it compares."
"If you are having trouble with the complex starting at Skyline into the Esses, this is not a steering wheel issue. 


Skyline is not just a corner on a downhill slope. It requires turning as you crest the hill, which significantly lightens the load on all wheels. With many low-downforce cars, braking here when unloaded is death. This isn't just iracing either. 


You need to adjust braking sequence back until you can safely navigate the corner complex, then start building your carrying speed back up. 


Once you start nailing Skyline, Mount Panorama is awesome "
"well if you want a real answer but without DD experience (my r5 comes in the mail tomorrow Ill let you know )  


With a g27 that is old AF my center is super light. Turn up damping a little bit. maybe 5-10%  


and turn your minimal force up to 5-10%.  


That is NECESARY for the g27. I d k how much it is for the g920 as it is newer and tighter but i but that would help you. my g27 does nothing in the center 10 degrees both ways so i turn super easy if I'm not lighter then hell which makes me squeeze my wheel SOOO hard and hurt my wrists lol."
"I understand that the car will become more oversteer in this situation, but as to whether it becomes heavier or lighter, I really don't know. That's why I have this question, maybe it is indeed a dead zone in the force feedback that becomes much more noticeable in this specific situation, since the slightest movement I make overloads the tires and the car slip away. Probaly also related to the car\`s setup."
"I have a T300 as well but never really get that feeling. I have no DD experience though so my reference isn’t great. To me though, the T300 just feels a bit dull and flat for FFB but it does the job well enough. I can still put down competitive times. I just have less feel than those with a DD."
The OP is asking how different a DD is in this scenario.
"What are you guys under me struggling to understand? OP asked if this sensation he is describing would be different on a stronger better wheel, lol?"
Have you ever seen a gear or a belt wheel with more than 10Nm?
">Read a book, brush up on your high school physics 

 That was unnecessarily rude."
"You can try driving down a straight and moving the wheel left to right, you should find that after a few degrees the ffb becomes noticeably heavier. If so then this is the central deadzone in the wheel causing the light behaviour. In terms of setup, you could shift the brake bias more towards the rear, this will help reduce oversteer under heavy braking.

Edit: I'm talking nonsense, shift the break bias more forward to reduce oversteer/induce understeer"
What is your force feedback set at in the sim? Does it say Strength or Max Force? If the Strength is really low you might want to turn it up even if it means clipping heavily mid-corner so at least you get some feel on turn-it. I used to have a G29 until I switched to a DD wheel and the deadzone in the center was because my ffb was just not high enough. The wheel didn’t have the range to replicate all of the forces coming from the telemetry.
Why would you want that over DD?
Shift the brake bias *more* towards the rear? Wouldn’t that make the car more likely to oversteer under heavy braking?
"I left it as iRacing set, 2.5 Nm and the strenght I adjusted on auto after doing a few laps in the track"
"Since every wheel over 10Nm is Direct Drive, I specifically asked for Direct Drive to make it clear. Come on, it's not that hard to understand."
"Yeah sorry you're right mate, I had a brain fart there, thanks for correcting me"
"When I was on the G29, I just dealt with the clipping because I wanted the feel on turn in. If you turn it up that will effectively get rid of the lightness at center."
I don’t think you understand what a direct drive is. It’s a different type of motor and way to deliver the force feedback. It has nothing to do with the strength of the force.
Sure. I always doubt myself on this so I’m hesitant to correct someone haha
I don't think yall understand his question
My lack of racing any open setup series shows😅
"The extent of my setup knowledge is: go to VRS, download setup, put setup into car folder, open sim, load setup. Lol"
Maybe they have 1000s of hours in other sims? Experience in real life racing? Talent?
"Maybe they are using burner accounts to practice, it happened to me the other day in SF23, not a rookie but the guy’s iR was 1k and half the field had 3-5K iR but the guy with 1K got the fastest qualifying lap and then he disconnected before the race started, which I thought was extra weird."
Most likely an experienced iracer with a smurf account. Initial signups get good promotions so it doesn't cost much for a smurf.
"I joined late Nov after black Friday. Everyone starts at 1350, so expect some to be really quick.
I was just on a 4 race win streak (once a week I do the new mx-5 track). Qualified half a sec ahead of 1700sof in mx-5 (was enough for 3rd in top 2600sof).  Point is, a few months probably isn't enough for everyone new to settle on their true iR.
Also, some found leagues like myself and prefer not to drive public events before their true iR gets settled.
P.s. I spend 95% time practicing and 5% racing. I'm basically dreaming of the track at night before I race 🤣"
"New accounts, prior experience, or practice before hand. When I first started iracing I spent about 2 weeks practicing and learning the tracks joined a few online practices sessions then went to my first race. Rocked up with the fastest qualifying time and then won that race.

Not every rookie is a dumpster fire."
"Could be new accounts, people that are already fast and just new to iracing or racers/karters that is dipping their toe into sims for the first time."
These people most definitely already have experience outside of iracing. Or they are a child prodigy or something using dad’s rig when he’s not looking
"It’s called tanking, and it’s not cool"
Yes. There is a SF dash on race department that I use.
I have the same question... wainting for a good soul
"You could modify the dash and add in whatever you want. You can copy formatting settings to try and get it to look natural. Idk if that helps, I just build my own as it's kinda fun to make them lol"
"Race Department is your best bet for all kinds of Simhub dashes, overlays, etc."
Race department.
"Was meaning to share this during the F3 x Silverstone week but forgot - wanted to share as this fixed F3 lap stands out among the poles I've had in iRacing (50 in 140) and IRL (F4 & F Renault) as a former racing driver. Have had poles/wins in top split races but even though this was a 2.3k SOF second split I feel this is one of the best laps I've put together across the sim & IRL.

Had a 7 tenth delta to P2 and averaged 0.8s quicker than the field in the race (and actually lapped ever-so-slightly faster on average than Will Power who was in the top split session !)

Damn near perfect lap
"Thanks mate, appreciate it!"
"Yeah, don't stop there straight after a race. If you're trying to farm SR, there's a 2 min countdown where incidents still count and so does going around corners. Hit f1 if you're by yourself at the end and you'll see the countdown, it'll stop and change to 15mins once the last car crosses the finish line and then you'll be safe from incidents.

If someone wanted to they could protest you for stopping there as well as it is mentioned in the sporting code not to stop immediately after the finish line once the race is over.

Get at least to the 2nd or 3rd corner before you reset out or if you're after that little bit extra SR, keep going until the timer ticks over.

But you've only got yourself to blame for this one."
Weird place to stop your car. Also seems like you were there quite a long time before resetting.
"OP, can we see the guys flipping pov, and maybe the green and black car? Thanks"
"Yeah, those are good points. It’s only my second month in iRacing, so that’s definitely a lesson and a painful one. Given how this layout goes to the right immediately after start/finish line, I thought I would be out of the way for everyone as it’s quite a bit off racing area. But lesson learned"
"Don't stress too hard, it's a learning experience. Admittedly Reddit is pretty harsh on mistakes, but if you learn from it and don't do it again then all the better.

You're already better than a lot of people on here that defend their bad decisions to the bitter end, so hopefully get to see you out there on the race track"
Williams already has multiple cars out of the race. At least they won't be tempted to cheat again.
"Seeing an enormous amount of telemetry data coming in on Garage 61 so processing will be slightly delayed. Updates will be posted on the Garage 61 Discord (https://discord.gg/94XwwyCkCW).


Good luck everyone!"
"This was my first time participating, just finished my last stint. Two stints of two fuel runs. I logged 121 laps..... with zero incident points. We may be 17th but I'm hyped with 0x."
Just finished up ours. Finished P2 overall. Holy FUCK I’ve never done that before and I am exhausted
"How is IR dished out for this race? I was the highest IR driver in my team, 2x more than the next highest but I received the most amount of IR.  I thought it would be the other way around, like normal races? I did however do the most laps and coincidently 2nd most laps racer got 2nd most IR etc.  Is this it?"
"We won the overall in our split because P1 had their team mate have a real life emergency, and this absolute legend went on to not only lead the 24 hour race, complete 896 laps, but also pull off the win as well.

iRacing needs to look into implementing an Ironman category for those crazy individuals that want to tackle this, or have such an endeavor thrust upon them and they are just that insane, dedicated or relentless enough to try it.

Personally, I need teammates"
"First 24, our engine blew up due to a bug and we finished p12 overall (we were in the caddy)"

"I think it's good as it is. If someone wants to do this as a challenge, or in an emergency, more power to them. But if we start glorifying it, every idiot who's not at all prepared for it will start trying.


It was bad enough when the first streamer did it for charity and got some recognition. That inspired someone in top split trying it, and he drifted into us on a straight due to mental fatigue."
A bug or you didn't turn it off during repairs?
You got DQed for not serving the penalty.  100%
There was no DQ limit. You should have received a drive thru penalty at 100x. If you didn’t serve that in 3 laps then you would be DQ.
Also congrats on P2
Thanks.

That's good to know. Im getting close to class B so long as I make the safety rating cut. I would have been super confused.
Heh
Reminds me of a kid on our golf team who got caught kicking his ball out from under a pine tree. The association banned him for 2 matches- coach banned him for the rest of the season. Senior year too.
Oh man I was like they're using the short course for this series?
"Just look at a Road Atlanta Track Map in Google, you cut around half the track"
"Like, the original course for Road Atlanta?! I'm surprised you got to B class with never going on Road Atlanta?"
I think at 20 secs in the vod turn left
Stan DARSH. I'll see you on the slopes.
"It has to be...but I have made this mistake as well. Why there are no pawns there, I don't know"
I loled..
"I could've sworn there were cones there in iRacing's GP layout, but I checked a video of my most recent race and there weren't."
"It was a joke. Obviously if it was a wrong direction the game would say it 100 times before making this far into the lap. Damn what wrong with people? Reddit is a very special place.  


BTW I'm pretty sure that OP is actually trolling."
"For me, it was more the surprise of seeing you go right at the top of the esses. Road Atlanta is one of my favorite tracks, on the sim and as a race fan. I drive the full course a lot, so I had a physical reaction when you turned the “wrong” direction. It was completely unexpected.

See if you can find the Vasser Sullivan Racing crash from Petit LeMans this past year on YouTube. When they haul the Lexus off, I believe they take it out through the gate where you turned right and cut the full course."
Right? Imagine learning a track before racing. I prefer to rally it.
"All assists are disabled including auto pit limiter, auto tear off, racing line, and pit exit line. Now might be a great time to learn to race without those things so that you’re ready for B class races, if that’s something you want to do!

I would note that while it takes some adjustment once you get rid of the racing line; it ultimately makes you faster and a better driver."
Wait that’s illegal in golf?
In Google? Just look at it in the UI while your session is loading. Crazy that OP would start driving without looking at the track map first
"I got A class and I have not done a single lap on it, in iRacing at least."
"I am even class A. I drive in lots of series and when I do not feel like learning a new track, I skip it"
Holy hell
"Ok for sure thanks! I'll start practicing with those off! I could probably do the racing line in test drive just to get used to a little bit of help and then of course race with it off. Unless it's a track I don't know, I don't really use it that much now. Just more of a comfort thing lol"
Only if you’re keeping score
I wanted to say this but i wasnt sure if the AI shows the right layout while loading
"Does this track map actually help you. Like, can you abstract from that to the track you are going? Wow. For me you could put down anything in the map. I would not recogize. I have no concept of the direction I am going. I drive entirely on the little voice in my head telling me what to do. You could say on instinct alone. I just did a race here after 50 laps of training and 20+ laps in the race somehow my instinct still send me the way I went here. DQ

But we are here for fun. Not for results, right?"
"> when I do not feel like learning a new track, I skip it

Yeah, we saw that in the video."
"Definitely here for fun. Looking at the map won't help you find the racing line or be quick, but it will tell you, for example, whether you should be expecting the esses to be followed by a long straight or a sweeping right-hander."
Man this reddit has no sense of humor down voting this.
But the video show me doing just that. Learn the track.
I ran the entire 24 hour with my rig on along with several background applications running. No issues whatsoever.
Yeah I don't know if this effects the game but on the iracing app there is UI backend services and stats API which are both down. I noticed it went down at about 25 mins ago. I'm not sure if these affect it but maybe  it could.
"I had 3 freezing disconnects due to packet loss, that I’ve never had before. But also did get an error while shutting down my computer so might have been on my end"
"I had similar issues when I used a Rift S. It was being caused by the headset pulling more power than it was given from the motherboard and black screening. I needed a PCI-E USB card that connected directly to the power supply to stop all issues. 

I bought [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FPIMJEW)"
"i'm more curious how you have that shown in garage61.

i know you can have maps overlayed in motec, but i've also tried it before and it was somewhat off a few metres."
Would be interesting how you expect to learn braking markers looking from above?
Motec has
[Z1 Analyzer](https://www.z1racetech.com/analyzer/index.cfm) does really good visual telemetry. You can get that exact same map overlay. Does $5 or $10 /mo though.
VRS does this well
"Popometer?
It’s a blind shot tho."
I did it in gimp(free photoshop) real quick.
Ideally a tool like VRS would have this. You could swap between cockpit view and overhead view to correlate track position.
"Motec looks more raw too, there's no curve smoothing like VRS"
Awesome software suite!
"Today I finally decided to learn how to paint using the Trading Paints app & Photoshop. I then debuted the work in progress paint scheme (livery) and somehow I won my first Gen 4 series race at Talladega with the new look despite running out of fuel before the finish line due to a green white checker that extended to 52 laps.


It was an odd race with a Yellow on lap 2 and not another caution until lap 35. I started P21 (didn't qualify) and hovered between P15-P20 until about 10 to go. After a caution on lap 48, I started P5 for the G/W/C. Somehow on lap 52 the front 4 crashed, allowing me to limp across the finish line. Btw, Double Cola is a soft drink in the U.S. here in the midwest & south. It was very popular in the 1970's. It's a similar brand to RC Cola."
Turn off Optional Updates?
"Did you reboot the computer and then try it? Btw, why are you downloading 49.21 gb? You don't have to download everything on that list, just what's required."
Reboot aka restart? Or does that mean something else. I’ve definitely restarted numerous times after downloading successfully
"Yes, restart. Are you updating iRacing or is this a new install and new subscriber? The download this week I believe was very small, well under 1 gb."
Nope I’ve been subscribed for a while. 2 weeks ago I had moved it to a different drive and it ran fine for a couple days but since then every time I get on it tells me these required updates need to be installed.
"Don't move anything to another drive or folder on original drive.  iRacing works with files in only 2 places, one in program files x86 and another in Documents\\iRacing.  If you move anything, iRacing doesn't know where it is and will ask you for it again (to be put in the proper drive & folder).  Please undo what you did; if that does not work, reinstall entire program and let it go to where it wants."
Make sure your Windows and video card software are updated. You may need to uninstall iRacing and reinstall it again. Wish you luck.
Hey thanks!
For sure. Probably gonna come down to that. Oh well. Thanks buddy.
"I’ve always had the exact opposite experience at Bathurst, nothing but polite people all trying to survive the mountain."
I’ve heard mixed things. Ive only been on iRacing for a few months and consistently started road racing this month. Finished P2 in the GT4 this week. Honestly my most proud race to date!
"I wouldn't know - I come from Oval so I have that turned off by default now lol. Every race is chill   


I had an amazing week at bathurst GT4 and 2 hour."
have you checked that fuel and tires were turned off? because those still take time. damage will show up in the pit stop time window. as a repair timer
"I am stupid.. Fuel refill was off, but i had no idea there was another tab on the blackbox about tyre change... Thank you!"
"You can use the autochat messages to uncheck fuel and tyres without menu diving. Just set one of them to #+fr -lf -rf -lr -rr +ws -fuel$ and bind it to a button on your wheel to check fast repair, uncheck all four tyres, check windshield tearoff (if applicable), and uncheck fuel. You can bind more specific button combos if you start racing a series that needs pit stops."
i have the same issue. it annoys me! ANYONE?
What a save! You should be a professional goalkeeper
"I love this car/track combo, but about 50% of the races that Ive raced I end up putting myself on a wall, it takes some serious control and concentration to be fast and not crash on most turns of this track."
"Just finished my first open race in this combo. WOW, talk about attribution. Only 6 cars finished on the lead lap!

Amazing fun though. Good save"
"Also worth checking that your throttle is reaching 100%, check it under options when you're in the pits on the controls screen."
"Without any other information, the first thought that comes to mind is that they're getting back on the gas sooner exiting the corners. This is assuming there's no drafting going on."
"I highly, highly doubt you’re hitting your turns “perfectly”"
"If it's not a setup issue, and it's not a hardware issue, you need to look at telemetry and see what you're doing differently than people who are faster, because if you were doing what they are doing, they wouldn't be faster than you."
Maybe your exits are bad?
"Not sure if it's relevant, but Dave Cam did a video about the speed differences using the various auto gearbox options vs manual.

The tl;Dr was that there was a significant speed difference.

So if you use auto blip, auto clutch, could be causing it?"
Bad exits are a hell of a thing.
"Have you checked your pedal inputs? Perhaps either your throttle isn't reaching 100%, or your brake is like 2% on constantly etc. Had this issue with the g920 pedals as they got older, if you're running potentiometer pedals this could be it."
"If you're hitting your turns perfectly you wouldn't be asking this question because your car would be faster than everyone else. 

My guess is that you suffer from what most beginner drivers suffer from: believing that braking late is fast. It's the opposite. 

Brake earlier + get on the gas earlier = faster in straight line."
"Well not every D class race is fixed setup, but beyond that have you checked the telemetry and confirmed that you’re doing the same thing through the corner as other cars? Because if it’s not the setup there’s not much else to it."
"Very possible there behind you at the start of the straight and then passing?

If so they’re getting the benefit of your slipstream and the extra momentum carries them past you.

The other alternative is that they are in fact getting a better exit than you"
"Couple of options:

1. There’s an issue with your throttle pedal and it isn’t telling the game you’re at 100%. Check the calibration. 

2. You’re shifting at the wrong time. 

And most likely;

3. You’re not getting a very good exit on the corner before the straight, or possibly not carrying enough momentum through a series of corners before a straight. ESPECIALLY if you aren’t trail braking. Trail braking shifts weight to the front wheels while allow you to turn at a higher speed than you can turn by just braking *before* a corner. The other drivers may be carrying a lot more speed through the corners and thus are starting out faster than you are. In a fixed setup race your acceleration is identical; so their higher exit speed carries them all the way through the straight at a higher speed then you had."
"It’s either exits not actually being “perfect”, or you have a throttle/brake issue as others have mentioned. Sometimes after I make calibration adjustments I’ll notice resting my foot on the brake is causing a 1-3% brake pressure on corner exit which completely robs top speed."
"Do you have your racing line on?

If you're using that FOR SURE you are not hitting perfect entry and exit and it's hard to realise because you are more focused on the line and not the speed."
"Is the race event the Fixed GR86 at Canada Tire Motorsport Park?  

If so, it is almost certainly that other cars are getting on the throttle earlier in turn 5. 

Slow in, fast out."
"I feel the same, even when I'm behind 0.5 seconds behind another car can't benefit from the slipstream feels like can't catch up and everyone else behind me can catch me easy"
"Do you have any clutch assists on? I'd recommend only using anti-stall assist, because other ones can and will make you slower."
How much fuel are you carrying? Even in fixed you can adjust fuel load and most fast guys are carrying barely enough to finish the race. If you have a full tank you are going to be slower
"As a corollary to this, make sure you don't have any latent brake drag..."
Good suggestion
Came here to say this. Sounds like OP needs to work on exit speed
Does auto-stall do this?
"figured it out

my brake pedal was partially depressed for some reason

reset my device and is fixed"
No. Anti-stall has no impact on speed.
That will do it! Glad you figured it out. That should make things a little more fun.
"It would be nice to have choice, but then again: looking at the real world Rolex 24 entries, it’s all Oreca chassis, and one Ligier. So, maybe choice is overrated."
I'd rather wait for the new LMP2's and get a brand new Oreca
I'd rather have the Lamborghini LMDh.
Never sadly. I’d love to see it but considering spec engine plus meh numbers at times with GTP’s now likely never.
Considering they are already gone in WEC and on their way out in IMSA and no one races the one we already have in iracing outside of special events I doubt we're going to see it anytime soon.
"No thanks, it can stay ugly as an LMP3"
We don't even have the Oreca that has been the dominant one for years
"It’s also a tough time, knowing that the spec is changing in 2025. Do you really want a car that is technically outdated in a year? Or would you rather have (say) two cars with the new spec launched side by side next year (assuming LMP2 is still in IMSA/Weathertech, which is no guarantee). "
"Only WEC is dropping LMP2.  Imsa, ELMS and ALMS will continue with LMP2 into the next generation."
"This was more of a tongue-in-cheek post because the lmp3 team that iRacing scanned, now has a lmp2 with a very similar livery."
"Sadly that is true, especially considering the popularity of Hypercar/GTP plus GT3 in WEC meant there is no LMP2 there irl. What’s to say IMSA won’t tell the pro-am’s to sod off into the GT3’s and turn GTD into something akin to GTWC with driver pairing classes plus GTP’s"
Ye need to go to settings to activate windows mate.
Oh and btw I was in a 2k average lobby and I have 1600 irating this wouldn've been incredible for me
My cat turned off my PC when I was in 3rd place yesterday with just a couple laps left. Would've been my first podium :'(
I switched my motherboard and it's told me I've been needing to do this for a while now .
"I believe its a MAC address thing. You basically need to tell windows that your account is now associated with the new MB, I could be wrong but I think that's what needs to happen."
Post your Fanatec wheel setting and in game setting and someone will advise. Have you done the FFB auto tune?
"I think another important thing is what car are you driving? Because ffb will feel different in each car

One thing you can try is, when in the car, there's a Blackbox option that's ""strength"" or something like that (not at home, so don't remember the actual word. It's at the bottom of one of the final blackboxes)

If you feel you're just not getting enough force out of it, you can try turning that strength up and see if that helps"
"Had that wheelbase, something is wrong on your end"
"This might not be quite as relevant now as I know there have been core iRacing FFB updates in recent history, but have you tried irFFB? Allows you to dial in specific oversteer/understeer intensity, and a lot of people swear by it."
"One thing that helped me massively was to add the minimum strength. I've seen videos recommending the total opposite, but that for me unlocked everything. All of a sudden I could feel the snaps as the minimum strength vanished when you lose the rear"
"iRacing doesn't have the fake arcadey type FFB you get in AC and ACC, it actually simulates the steering wheel column you would feel irl... but you should definitely still be able to feel it. 


I drive with a G29 wheel and feel everything. "
Another vote for irffb. It made a massive difference on my ability to catch a slide. Still spin out but only rarely.
"Depends on the car, MX5 has very light steering. If you want it exaggerated (and unrealistic) turn up the FF"
Welcome to iRacing
"It's actually pronounced ""iceRacing"", now you know why. "
"Give irFFB a shot. It's a separate program that you run along with iracing that changes how the ffb feels. I spent a little over a year on other sims before switching and thought it felt not wrong, but different on iracing. irFFB makes it feel like ac, acc, ams2 where it simulates gforces so you know you're going to slip before you slip"
"I had the same, you just have to get used to the difference in ffb philosophy.
It will come I promise, for me now it is the other way around."
"Map a button or key to iRacing auto-ffb and drive a few laps and press it.  Have custom settings for each car so it remember it next time, although on a new track you might want to press it again some times.  This works wonders.  Also think about cranking up the intensity slider in iRacing."
"Depends on the car some I think too, but my wheel gets light like I lost the grip, almost floaty. I will lift, power thru, countersteer or all three depending how bad"
"For the actual settings, I like to use auto, then make the ffb a little lighter.  What might help is too turn down the engine noise, and turn up the the tire sounds, it helps a great deal to train your brian to match the noise with the ffb feeling, the lightness when understeering is there, but its more subtle."
"Honestly coming from acc, I feel the opposite.

I loved iracing for the ffb, while I found weird the acc ffb, I can feel all scrub in the asphalt but cant feel the car."
Try turning the tyre noise volume up... made a big difference to me as you hear the tyres starting to complain earlier...
iRacing is easy for me but ac is hard. What you're describing is how I'd describe ac. So this could just be about getting used to the game.
"engine sound down. Tire sound all the way up.  


Make sure iracing settings are correct o match your wheel output. Press auto on f9 after a few laps for each car track."
Yes I have. I use recommended settings from Fanatec forum so I guess there is no need to post it as everybody probably started with those.
"As I'm rookie I'm mostly driving Mazda. Can't check it atm but probably using default settings of strength, will definitely try to play with that"
Interesting. What wheel do you have and how much minimum force you have?
Those effects are fake but are somehow compensating lack of g forces in simracing so you can feel limits
lol coming from someone with a g29!  Iracing has canned spins. It will never be in the same league as ac or acc.
"Sorry but I also recently started playing iRacing and have a Fanatec DDPro. I’ve been doing actual motorsport and trackdays for over a decade and I’m not really sure what you think arcade FFB is? I probably still need to tweak the settings but first impression is iRacing has very muted FFB outside of curb and bump feel. Can’t feel the weight when loaded at all, really don’t feel the car at the limit. Don’t feel tires at all through the wheel. In my Miata track car even with power steering I still feel much more through the wheel than what iRacing gives you."
Sorry but in real life the MX-5 has much better steering weight and feel than what you get in iRacing. They try their best but it’s far from real life.
More accurate to real life and not the arcade yes
I'm convinced this idea comes from people who can't make it through the out lap and only ever experience cold ties.
"Ugh. Don't do this. Especially if you have DD. 

It adds lag. And if you install vjoy to remove the lag there's all sorts of nasty stuff that can happen to your system. Ask me how I know."
I use the settings on Fanatec website with same base and can feel the loss of grip just fine. That said lots of people who come from AC and ACC post the same complaint that you did so seems some people have hard time adapting between the two different FFB systems.
Yes probably good luck
"Absolutely crucial - do this for every car. For 8nm I usually do a few laps, set it to auto, and sometimes then set it just a bit (0.5-1) below the auto strength setting. In any case, it's worth knowing that this setting is crucial to change per car- especially if you're moving between very different kinds of cars like F4 vs mx-5. (The former requires a strength of around 8 for your wheel, and the latter might be something like 15 or 20, can't remember at the moment.) Setting it correctly for each car will provide you with the maximum amount of information. Setting it too low will mean that you're not getting as much out of your wheel motor as you could, and setting it too high means you'll be clipping and thus losing information."
It’s actually a very good advice. Try to set max force using auto button in F9 blackbox. It adjusts the FFB strength so you don’t have clipping and it helps. But you’ll never get anything close to AC or rf2 in iRacing until the rfactor guy they hired fixes the tyres. 
"G29 so entry level wheel. Only low at 6-8 if I remember. Takes away the smallest of details at the lower end, but snaps are recognisable and a lot closer to what I feel in other Sims."
"It sounds more like you're just adapting to a different game


Do you actually believe people on iRacing can't feel oversteer or understeer they just hope for the best every turn?"
I‘m waiting for 360 hz ffb and tyres updates just to see what all these non-„arcadey“ experts gonna write.
"lol that's absolutely not true


do you just hang out on this sub to talk shit about iRacing? 



you can just go to r/simracing which is just a giant anti-iracing circlejerk, you'll be happy there "
Ha ok. I've got quite a bit of seat time in Spec Miata but whatever.
Have you ever driven a real car in your life?
Real life FFB doesn’t have 60Hz update rates
"It’s been around a lot longer than cold tires having a real effect has (on older tire models, colder = more grip no matter what. Cold tires being slow and having less grip wasn’t a thing until the newest iteration or what was once called NTMv7). 

Not to say that people who talk about “iceracing” aren’t heavily coping but the nickname has been around longer"
"I'm only joking, mostly, but I do think there is something to it. I've been racing in the MX5s for about three weeks now and I jumped back on AC LFM yesterday to see how it compared, and the car feels so much better to drive on the limit compared to iRacing, which to me feels a bit numb by comparison. I'm not going to say slides are completely unrecoverable but I sure as shit can't recover them as reliably.


I'm having a go with irFFB to see if I can replicate a feel closer to AC because I strongly prefer that type of force feedback in how it communicates oversteer.


Maybe if you have a motion rig and butt kickers then iRacing's approach makes more sense, I don't know. And yes, I do have a direct drive wheel. "
Eh I don't have DD and I've been about a second faster since you using it so everyone's results vary
"As someone with thousands of hours in both iR and AC, I believe it is the tire model. The FFB in iRacing feels good. There's just many cars that are completely unforgiving when you slip the tires"
"that's going to make you so much slower in the long run 


so much terrible advice in this thread "
"Yes I do, that's exactly what I meant. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval) I just wasn't sure if it's just a problem with my settings or as you said adapting to a different game with no arcadish oversteer effects."
yeah no one on iRacing can feel oversteer or understeer we all go into every turn hoping for the best 
Are you suggesting iRacing feels realistic compared to a spec Miata? I don’t think I’ve ever driven one with power steering still on it so my wheel base doesn’t have enough torque to come close to replicating it.
"I love it when people latch onto something trivial and then blame it for all their failings. It's cute. 

Don't get me wrong, I like when they make things better, but the poling rate for ffb getting increased isn't going to be the change you think it is."
"That's just odd. You shouldn't gain time using it, it just makes it easier for some to correct oversteer etc."
Why will it? Surely it's subjective? To me it feels like irffb without the lag. I'm sure when I get a DD with more than 2nm Itll be unnecessary.
Add a /s
I'm saying in my experience Miata steering is quite light at speed. The track feel is decent but not overwhelming.
Where did I blame anything
Maybe the speed is just coincidence then and I'm just getting better
lol if the data he gets from his wheel helps him understand his cars weight / grip more then it 1 million percent could correlate to pushing faster and seeing faster lap times.
"because instead of learning how to feel a spin in the ffb you tuned your ffb specifically to amplify the feeling of a spin, losing the sub spin subtleties that help you get more performance out of the car


this is especially true for low force wheels "
"Some times cheap wheels have to tune out some stuff to get others... MY g27 is so old and used that it has 0 feel in the first 10 degrees of rotation either direction i have to add damping and minimum to have some catch and weight in the center otherwise i can turn soooo easily.

Who cares tho my moza r5 is in the mial lol"
"I'd say start out in the global mazda MX-5 fanatec Cup, its the go to starting point for rookies. Jump into a practice session first until you feel like you're up to speed, you'll have a rough time of it if you jump straight into races without a little bit of practice first. The track stays the same for 1 week of racing (changes Monday night/Tuesday morning at midnight), so people have a chance to really get to grips with each circuit before racing."
"Are you looking to focus on road, oval, dirt oval, or dirt road?"
"""She's a beaut,  Clarke """
Do you have any pics of the full rig? Not sure I've seen what looks to be a modular wooden rig?
"Clean, just paint it in black and voilà !"
Rock Solid Rigs is one of those that offer wooden rigs https://rocksolidrigs.com/rsr-21-sim-racing-cockpit/
Clutch! Thanks a bunch. That looks to be the exact rig OP has.
"Correct, think it's the only wooden rig around. Took it because of the esthetics"
Avoiding is a better skill to have than actual racing 😅
"T1 Summit Point, close the vortex early, brake 20m early and light trailbrake at lower than hotlap speed, VERY tight line. Watch the kerb. Avoids 99% of incidents. 

Only 3 of my 12 races here this week have had clean T1s. Don't worry though, T3 sand trap spins and kerb jump RKOs handled the rest of the necessary collisions for cosmic equilibrium.

Blows my mind how many people think hotlapping teaches you how to race a track. Usually takes 15-20 race laps with cars near me before I'm fully confident to fight hard on a given track. Will usually start being defensive after a few laps though, but attacking is such a higher standard of handling and track knowledge."
Some of these were hilarious.    Good avoidance skills though.
shame the guy going through the forest didn't take out the guy who caused it
But it’s everyone else’s fault that my SR is 0
"Pubs are almost impossible.  
1800SOF, I qualified half a second up on every other person at 1:21:1 this past Monday. T5, first hairpin - smashed from behind. Had to come from last back to 2nd and the guy who punted me wins. Nothing I can do in that circumstance. People just routinely go for way too much between divebombs and late braking on cold tires. Glad I switched to league racing."
This exact T1 scenario happened to me tonight. The difference is the guy hit me in the door 😭
"Well, in rookie class this is enough to succeed 😀 just drive and wait everyone else crashed."
"I’ve found AI racing really helpful. You can practice different racing lines, develop confidence driving side by side and not being worried about your safety rating. Problem of hotlapping is that you need to be fast one lap. In race you should be able to drive consistently for 10+ laps at least."
Indeed yes!
So true...I don't think I've ever legitimately passed someone on track ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy) but still manage podiums by just sitting back and waiting for the inevitable carnage
"Big one for me is also intentionally going past the limit, especially in corners with more complicated entries, like Y3 Summit Point, where there are a few ways to run through it and where and how to brake and you need to know them because it is a common corner to be attacked in. 

I really don't want to get any incident points rn as I'm grinding out licenses (also just a safe driver in general) and learning how to recover from early/late apex and lock-ups really boosts my confidence. I found that when I've got a good position and the guy behind is sorta hunting me, but I should be able to easily hold the gap, I start dropping 0.3-0.5s per lap because I'm trying not to send too hard and this seems to actually be more dangerous than just hitting it normally.

I usually warm up 30 minutes before the first race of the night and just casual lap for five laps, then start over-pushing the limits in different corners in different ways, then back down a few percent before qualifying. After that race, a few laps of practice, again toying with the limits but not actively looking to exceed them gives me pretty good quali results and keeps me confident for the race."
"Yesterday I started an F4 race 15th out of 22 on the grid. I finished third. I didn't make a single overtake on track. Literally all but two of the cars ahead of me crashed into one another and I managed to stay out of their way through a combination of careful driving and sheer luck. This is where I am with it - I don't feel like I'm ready for the F3s, which I find a bit difficult to drive; but the F4 is just carnage. Meh."

Just means how active you have been compared to the last 30 days
"You have been active 27 of the last 30 days. In the 30 days before that, you were active 9 days."

Love the new livery but wish mclaren had kept some blue trim or pinstriping somewhere.

"We have an IR-18 league called MondayCar (Green flag Mondays at 9pm ET).  Relaxed atmosphere with a range of driver abilities and helpful people.  We're finishing up our first season right now to feel things out, but will attempt a larger recruitment push leading into the 2nd season when the real world IndyCar series starts back up.  You're welcome to come check it out:  [https://discord.gg/zy8GRtWt4Y](https://discord.gg/zy8GRtWt4Y)."
We have a Tuesday night SF23 and a Saturday mid day multiclass
"I'd be down to try, Stafford, Thompson and NHMS?"
That sounds awesome I want to join!
Absolutely. I'm trying to find the 2024 schedule that includes Stafford but I'm lost. There's frikin 4 or 5 different mod types and their schedules don't list Stafford. Obviously they're racing there but where else officially?
Roger that.lets figure out a way to organize it
If you're talking Tri-Track Modifieds they race at Thunder Road in VT and White Mountain Motorsports Park in NH but those aren't on iRacing.
"I just looked at that schedule. Lol

https://monacomodifieds.com/monaco-modified-tri-track-series-releases-2024-schedule/

There are touring mods that go to Stafford... are they tri track? I'm trying to find the complete ""open modified "" tour"
"Yeah, what you linked is correct I believe."
Welp.... I guess I can just make a championship up lol
"Can only get better at it by doing it.   Maybe starting with some shorter endurance races, even like a 45 minute IMSA race to get into it to start?  

Bathurst is also particularly brutal of a track for endurance as well (and not well suited for multi-class IMO) so maybe working at easier tracks would help as well?"
"One trick is to not go 100% for the entire race, dial it down a notch and drive at 95% until you are used to longer races. For me it becomes driving on autopilot unless there's something going on requiring more attention."
"This might sound silly, but I’d recommend some sort of grounding technique. For IRL road trips and sim enduros, I always have a drink (for sipping) and a bag/jar of candy. Whenever I start to check out mentally, I take a sip or two and consider having some candy. It’s like a “reset” ritual that gets me back to focusing on my race/drive and pulls me far enough from stressing about tires/fuel/damage that I feel the need to re-evaluate my car with the perspective of “just gotta make it to the next pit stop” instead of stressing like Atlas trying to hold up the entirety of my race moment-to-moment. Then you can do an IRL pit stop to re-stock drink+snacks while your car’s being serviced."
"You're starting out, you don't need to do anything advanced at the moment.

When I started IMPC, I just raced all week as my practice. For the last open race before the IMPC, start with a full tank just to feel how the car is with a full load. Then just pit when you have to. You'll do one full stop and one splash and dash where you won't take tyres.

Best of luck, it's a fun series to run!"
"Bathurst is a rough track for your first endurance.


That said, you have to work up to it. Do a full fuel run in practice, then take a break. After that's comfortable, do a stint and a half.


You don't necessarily have to go further than that in practice, but you want to be comfortable going into a second stint.


I now commonly do 90 minutes as a warmup. But ai do still get mental fatigue around 2:45-3:00. But that's bevause 2 hour stints is the stamdard with my team. If I started doing longer on a regular basis I'm sure I'd adapt."
"When I was doing them I just kind of jumped in two footed. If you want to train yourself to do it, set up AI sessions with GT4 and TCR AI roster and then increase the race by 15 mins each time, or by whatever increment you want. 

Eventually you’ll get to a point where the rhythm takes over and before you know it it’s the first pit stop. Slap some fresh rubber on with that full tank and head back out. 

You’ll probably (most of the time in my experience) need a second stop for a small splash and dash later. 

You can also calculate the two stops out more evenly if you don’t mind being off cycle to the majority. The TCRs only need one stop and usually no tires so as long as you don’t get distracted by the other class you’ll probably do just fine."
Do some of the longer solo events. Join a league that does longer races
You might be using your vision wrong and only looking directly in front of the car instead of far up the track
"This is probably the difference between sim racers who started out as ""gamers"" and sim racers who started as car enthusiasts who only sim race and don't play other stuff.

 As a life long gamer and it guy who sits and stares at screens all day, I can race in VR for like 4 hours before I start to have concentration/vision issues and on a flat screen basically indefinitely. Example, I worked a 14.5 hour shift due to a big issue at work a few days ago staring at a screen the whole time and although I was bored, I never had any eye issues. I actually finished my shift and then went and sim raced in VR for a couple hours. 

 If you are not use to intensely focusing on screens for hours on end, the closeness to screens in most sim rig setups, particularly triples will probably wreak havok on your eyeballs. There are glasses that are designed to reduce eye strain by filtering blue light and such that might help you out. Other than that it's probably a case of just getting use to it."
"For endurance racing you need endurance conditioning.  I found this out when I started doing the IMPC and NEC races.  It's like muscle memory - the more you drive for long periods of time the more comfortable you get with it.

Start by driving for long periods of time in practice/test drive sessions.  Learn to blink so you don't dry your eyeballs out, and get used to concentrating for long periods of time.

When you do your first long races don't be afraid to pit early if you find yourself zoning out.  When you pit get out of your chair and stretch for a few seconds.  The time you lose doing this is less than the time you lose crashing.  Don't drive to win - drive to survive."
Good luck! I loved IMPC when I ran GT4. My tip is that it's okay to pit a lap or two early if it means you avoid traffic.
You're using VR right? Get monitors.
"Ugh I hit that exact curb earlier this week, bounced left into the wall and made a real big mess ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)."
"Just wait until you start running special events and you're pulling multiple 3 hour stints.

Only way to get better at it is to do it."
"I've been on the service for four years now, where I average two seasons pretty seriously, a casual season, and an off-season every year. It's not intentional, that's just the way it tends to work out between life/work/etc., but I've noticed that only in the last season or two have I been able to crank out multiple 45+ minute races in a day (assuming I have the free time obviously). 

It's taken a long time to get to this point, and for a long time I honestly never assumed I would; I figured my limit was about 45 minutes aside from exceptions like special events where I *really* push myself and practice *hard*. But I've been snowed in for the better part of the last week, and I've had 16 race starts without it taking the mental and physical toll it used to. It really does just take time, and sometimes longer than you expect."
"Bathurst is great for that. That long straight is the perfect place to stretch, take a sip, etc."
"I’d recommend towing, taking the repair, and finishing out the race.

Also you need to learn how to communicate with your car. Where you place your car sends a message to the cars behind. It won’t always work (some drivers can’t read) but if you don’t leave a gap, nobody can dive that gap."
"mazda series has a free repair, you should have finished the race  


you'll have a much better time simracing if you focus on what you can control, and in this case you chose to ragequit instead of finishing the race and salvaging both iR and SR"
"I’m sorry you got off to a rough start. Unfortunately stuff like this happens. Best thing you can do is dust yourself off and go again. Learn how to identify the idiots so you can maximise your chances of avoiding them in the future.

As a side point, did you use your fast repair? In Rookie and D-Class races you get 1 free fast repair that’ll fully repair all damage instantly. You  may lose a lap to the leaders, but you can still recover a bunch of safety rating and maybe salvage a half-decent result if you use it."
"My honest feedback on this is that everyone has a rough rookie season unless your Jimmie Johnson - 

Just take your time and join another session. 

Plus, always tow and fast repair."
"Just some advice, take it or leave it. Don't sweat the numbers right now. Go out there and race, try to be safe, and do your best to finish. Don't fight tooth and nail for any one position and keep your eyes on your mirrors. Focus on running clean laps and finishing races and the rest will take care of itself."
"It’s rookies , could have been that guys first race also. Shenanigans always happen in rookie races , everyone is learning. The ones who actually learn graduate up the ladder and those who don’t go on to play hello kitty adventure island.

The best advice I can give to anyone first starting out….have fun , first and always have fun. The second this isn’t fun take a break and do something else"
"You're in the rookie league. There are many skills involved in racing. Consistency, offense, defense, tire management, general pace, incident avoidance etc. You might be good at consistency and defense, but maybe someone else has more raw pace. It leads to frustration. 

Expect rookies to suck. That's why R class exists. Distinguish yourself among the rookies if you want to move up. It's not hard, especially in formula vee, where people make a lot of unforced errors. I've noticied a significant improvement in racecraft from R to D and D to C. Currently racing in ~1400 sof C class lobbies and the racing is awesome. People are still not perfect drivers but they are very respectful."
Try again!
"I qualified P5 my first ever race. At the start the guy in P1 selected reverse instead of first and floored it. I didn't even make it across the start/finish line. 

Wasn't all bad as I won the next 2 races!"
"> Anyone else have a rough first session in iRacing


I spun in front of the two leaders and took them both out. It's been 12+ years and I still remember that."
Chances are high that u have an accident on your first multiplayer race. That’s normal.
"It was on a straight so there wasn't really much I could do about it, dude got a better exit out of a corner than me but instead of going around decided my bumper was the best place to drive into. I was holding my line on straight too, no weaving or moving around so it wasn't like he didn't know where I planned to be.

And I didn't know about the free tow+repair, will definitely use it next time just to finish the race"
How can you make this work?  I have the fast repair checked in my black box window.  But I always sit for 1.5 minutes while my car is repaired in the pits.  (I press the Tow button to get me to the pits)
"Yeah my second day went much better, actually got myself out of rookies an up into a D license so pretty happy about that."
"Another tip i learned in rookies, when you grid for the race go into the black box and make sure you unclick adding new tires and adding fuel. If you have to pit it will make it much faster and even if you wreck you don’t need a new set or more fuel."
"That’s rookies, that’s mx5s especially, or anything else highly populated with low ranked drivers. 

I’ve willingly sacrificed my irating lately to drive clean races and get higher licenses which have helped. Having more choice has been a big benefit. I’ve been able to find races with 10 ish cars on the grid and I’ve found that typically those less populated races are made up of people who love the car and specifically want to drive it. As such, they tend to not be idiots.

Someone in here recommended the Skip Barber to me for that reason. Most people moved on, so the Skip lobbies tend to be really clean. Everyone is way faster than me, but I can chase the lack and drive incident free races.

Im comfortable attacking and defending, but that doesn’t work for me when you have no idea if the drivers around you have a brain in their head. 

Once I started getting better licenses I was able to race other cars I wanted to. I’ve found a lot of good F3 lobbies for instance. Again, typically everyone’s faster than me but I usually find 2-3 people at the back of the pack that I can be competitive with and practice racing against.

I’m getting lower finishes in F3, but that’s mostly because there aren’t ten people wrecking each other sending me onto a podium via survival like you can see in the mx5 stuff. 

You’ve either got to qualify at the front of the rookie packs, or be very adept at avoiding crashes, both in front and behind you. I was focusing on safety rating tonight and ended up letting three people pass me. I could tell in my mirrors that they were diving into corners recklessly, braking way too late etc. I wasn’t willing to get wrecked or take incidents just so I could finish 8th instead of 11th. Two of the three ended up spinning and I passed them anyways lol."
"Checking the box is enough. There’s no way around the tow time, though. If the car is still drivable, it’s almost always quicker to take it back to the pits yourself. 

Is your pit crew maybe giving you a full service? I think by default your crew will fill up your tank and give you 4 new tires, which is obviously completely unnecessary most of the time, and can take over half a minute in some cars.

It’s part of my pre-race “ritual” now. During gridding, I’ll go through the F4 and F5 black boxes to make sure that the “begin fuelling” and “change tires” boxes are unchecked. The fast repair by itself should only take a couple of seconds."
"The towing time doesn’t count, you will always have to sit through that. However what you do need to do is make sure fuel and tires boxes are unticked as those will happen before the fast repair. They’re not needed in rookie races, but are on by default and will cost you time."
You can also change app.ini file so you never need to tick them off.
Thank you.  I will try that.
Joy to Key.
"Before you create custom setup with any car, create your default setup. Any bindings you want to transfer too all other cars, create them then. Once done, as you load cars, check the box for custom control. From there add the other button mappings specific to that car."
"Right.  This is what you do when you're starting out.  So, after you do this and you've been racing for 6 mo + and then decide you want to add a 24-button box for things like pitting, chat, crew chief, etc. that will be common across all cars, how do you map the box for all cars without doing it 6 times or starting over with your custom controls?"
Have to redo. At least that's how I've done it. Unless someone knows a different way.
"This is insane. I can maybe go 2 hours before I have to go to the bathroom.

Also concentration is going down noticeably after 1-1.5 hours."
Are you doing this solo?
"Very impressive, well done!
I also like the location of your flatmap!"
And I’d maybe lose 5 seconds or so every time I needed to use the bathroom during pit stops
Longest stint I’ve ever done before was the 2.4h IMSA endurance last week before this lmao
I think the fact he's going to bed suggests not. Unless he has a rig in the bed. 
Yeah couldn’t find an lmp2 team so thought I’d see how far I could get before I went insane
I also have a track map at the top right but it can be so handy to check when you’re coming out of the pits
"Lol nah I know some guys who have done it solo, and just take a nap in the middle. Race doesn't count. But couldn't see his team mates or anything. Hence the question."
"I race strictly LMP2s, if you’re looking for a team I’d be more than happy to race with you sometime. Let me know (I believe we have raced before also, your name looks familiar)"
"Yeah sounds good I’m in need of someone bc I’d always love to do more endurance events but no one I know plays so it sounds good, send me a friend request on iRacing I’m definitely down for the Sebring 12h and potentially the Bathurst 12 even though that is a gt3 event"
I watched it and my neck hurts now.
It looks like it's driving up and down a wall lol
Yeahhh my bad lmao I don’t know how to save videos from my computer 😂
"You definitely didn't get disqualified for incident points, so it had to be something else. Perhaps you had a penalty to serve and didn't serve it within the three laps you're given. Impossible to say without any other context. 

There was a team in my split that had 258 incident points. If they didn't get disqualified for incident points, you certainly didn't."
"100x is a stop and go, then every 20x after that (directly from the series info). Probably didn't serve your penalty would be my guess."
"The only 2 ways you will be forcibly removed will be either ignoring a black flag for a penalty or driving the wrong way, there is no hard incident limit, check the post race results when the event concludes"
sure you didnt register for an IMSA race?
holy hell lmao 258?!
Lol
"Probably what you said, set up issue for the AI cars?"
"Yeah, there's an AI calibration issue at that track in all NASCAR cars."
You are the king!
"Another thing to look into is weather. When running AI on identical settings but different weather, a hot track will make them crazy slow and cold will make them crazy fast (beating iRacing track records by 1s+). While I normally run road course, heat still may be your problem. 

Try these weather settings and see if they become any quicker:

Dynamic Sky: Off
Specific Date: Off
Time of Day: Morning
Sky: Mostly Cloudy
Air Temp: 18 C
Rel Hum: 45% 
Wind: 3KPH - N

If they end up being crazy fast I move the time of day to afternoon and/or begin ramping up the air temp until their pace falls in line. As of the last week I don’t even adjust skill sliders to fix the pace, only the weather.

Hopefully this works for you, if not we can confirm you king of Indy oval!"
"So….I’m not Indy Oval supreme? Haha their pace did improve for qualifying with the rubbered in track but so did mine…52.564 for me on pole and 52.634 for outside pole. Gonna run the race anyway should still be fun unless I run away from them. 
I’ll pretend I’m just that good for now and then see about tweaking the AI stats. Not done that before."
There any way to fix it and make them competitive there? I ran the race and it was boring as hell. Led the entire thing but then got black flagged after I won for doing my burnout celebration and driving the wrong way on the track. What sort of shit is this? 🤨 I thought this was America.
Just as I thought! Thanks King 🤴
"Thanks brother I will definitely check this out. 

And yeah I kinda figured I was the king. Now just waiting on Rick Hendricks to stumble on this thread and reach out to me."
"Lowering the track temp seemed to just make everyone faster. Including me though. Still ended up .2 faster than the next fastest. 

For context I just finished a fun GT3 race at Watkins Glen where I qualified outside pole and won the race but was pressured pretty heavily in the final laps. AI was set to 50-60."
You might be the king of Indy :)
Report the issue in the AI section on the forums. The AI devs do read it.
Alright I posted it on the forums
"it's been a thing forever, them telling you is somewhat new"
"Not all damage can be repaired. This thing not a new. Sorry for you, but now you must race in damaged car if it's not dangerous for others or leave that race."
Been a thing forever. Was even more fun back when it was literal HOURS and you were told it couldn't be fixed.
"Most endurance cars the virtual crew can completely reconstruct corners of the chassis, so this is relatively rare. But there's still sometimes things that can't be repaired."
"I’ve gotten in a wreck at Martinsville last year and the rear axle was rotated 40 degrees out of line. Fixed all damage in pits and finished the race with the axle still at 15 degrees. Do you know how weird it feels to turn for the straight ways and straighten the wheel for the turns.

There is a damage threshold where not all damage will be repaired."
"Honestly this is the first time in any race or endruo where the car hasn't been able to be repaired 

And we have had plenty of major damage accidents in the past. So for us this is new"
"Yeah another guy said the same thing
It seems we have been lucky to this point because up until now we have never had this
Closest we had to this was nurbs 24h and we just had front aero damage after our first meatball 

But never have we had unrepairable wheel damage, hence the reason for asking. Cos we have had plenty of meatballs in the past, but never been put outta the race before"
"I'm discovering that while I feel I've had bad luck with accidents over the last 3 yrs, it seems I've been having amazing luck as this was a first 🤷🏼‍♂️"
"yea so thaats what we had  
going around the oval and turning left we had the steering wheel at 11 and 4  


as i said, in over 3 yrs we have never experienced this thing. so was amazing"
back in the glory days you sat for 40 mins of required and the car was still toast
"Few more things, maybe it's will be interesting or helpful for you.

We race in Jimmy's race for mental health. Our Mazda takes a hit on the back and go into wall little bit in front side. So we have repairs anyway. We finished all repairs but, after morr than hour our engine just shuts down. Without any worming. We think (we, team, not sure why) it's because pitcrew when repairing our car do not repair engine because he looks ok. Than during a race engine broke because of light damages.

Second, I has ""to much damage, we ore done"" on F4 race. Other racer hit me in the side. Wheel are or, my car was in control like a new. But I have a meatball. So in the pits my pitcrew just regret to repair me, because damaged that can't be repaired. My side was looked horrible."
"Interesting 
For us the only time we noticed somewhat perminate damage was the nurbs 24h last yr with the aston gt4
After our first meatball (stuck in the fence) we were just down on top end speed and the front aero package was just never repaired, but wheel damage was 

We had prob....6 or 7 meatballs that race and yea. Car came back just minus that front splitter

Learn something never everyday it seems

Sucks cos the GTP that killed us basically had no damage. And kept racing with what appears no issue at all"
"And you had to feel it, the spotter didn’t tell you. So even if you repaired all damage, you would still be paranoid for an entire stint."
"ah, the lmp1 special"
"I think something was seriously wrong with the Aston in that race (maybe it still is). We also lost like 40 km/h of top speed even after full repairs.

And the car to car damage does behave very weird this year. We had an instance where we hit a GT that was sliding back on track and we got a broken suspension and a 6 minute meatball, and they had no damage. So it looks like it is easy to have a crash where somehow only 1 car is damaged."
"Yeah we had the same thing in the aston for that race, everyone was complaining about it. But we had a couple of good crashes at that race (we all kinda hate racing nords) but yeah, car felt good and drive able......its why we found today so weird, in the fact we felt the crash was fairly minor compared to stuff in the past...but it ended our race"
"Come to the global racing league. We have a weekly MX-5, Porsche cup and LMP3. Great group of folks of all levels. The leaders do a great job of reviewing and keeping the league clean. 

https://discord.gg/mpdFNY9W"
Go to hosted races there is almost always a few leagues running recruitment races. You may need to hop around till you find a league you like. Be aware they are usually run by someone that is racing in the league so there may be biased rule calls depending on the league owner.
"I’ll be honest, I made a Reddit post asking for league recommendations and joined a couple of oval leagues from there. What kind of league are you looking for?"
"What kind of cars are you looking to drive and what's your timezone? 

Leagues are sorta what they sound like. People start leagues, recruit drivers and hold hosted sessions that count towards a league championship."
"Let me know if you find anything, im EST NA as well on the roadside"
"Awesome, thank you! I’ll definitely check it out"
"Ok cool, I’ll look into that tonight. Thanks!"
"Oh ya probably should of specified that. I really only do road, so something in that."
"So the only purchased car I have is the GT4, but I’m really open to anything. I like open wheel too, just mainly want to get better at racing. My time zone is EST"
"If you’re willing to drive touring cars, alpha touring challenge is good (I’m biased). Otherwise Sunday night skippy or the global racing league are both good. You could race all three, they’re on different days

Alpha touring challenge https://discord.gg/Zv8Y4hSXkZ

Sunday night skippy https://discord.gg/Zdx7TNXEqu"
"I think GT3 have the most leagues. What kind of cars are you wanting to compete in? In the mean time, I’ll get to finding some leagues and send some recommendations!"
Im definitely not against tcr. Is there a discord or is just a league on iracings UI? I'm not very good either.
"Awesome, thank you! GT3 does seem really cool. I have a friend who likes those races, only thing is as of right now I think all the series are Class C (I’m class D). GT3, GT4 and open wheel, I think would be my top 3"
"I edited my post to include the links. Atc is Monday nights at 9:30 eastern and Sunday night skippy is Sunday at 8pm eastern if I remember correctly

Both leagues have enough people that you’ll have someone to race with, and you’ll have a community that’s more than happy to help coach and teach you to get better."
">4 rear ends and 1 off track even if I drive very conservatively. 

Is it possible that you might he driving *too* conservatively? When people are racing, there is kind of an expectation that develops for how people are probably going to drive, but if you are driving unusually slow, or braking unusually early, people might not be prepared for that and stuff like this can easily happen. Another sure fire way to cause wrecks is the classic ""trying to stay out if the way."" The intent is understandable, but more times than not it causes problems for substantially slower cars to do this."
"The question is not what your iRating is. The question is are you having fun driving in iRacing. It does not sound like you are. If it is not fun why do it. If your iRating was higher would that make it more fun for you? iRating is used to match you with drivers of equal skill, so as your iRating goes up your competition will get harder."
"Setup a A.I. season and race them for a while, it sounds like it will fit your schedule, and when you're feeling good, jump in an official race once in a while."
"I guess it depends on what you want.

I suck. I’m slow af. But I have a lot of fun. For me; the “wins” don’t come from winning races but winning an individual battle here and there. With that mindset, I feel like I often win. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of getting locked in with another driver for lap after lap and finally getting past them and making it stick.

Don’t worry about iRating. Chasing iRating or trying to obtain a high iRating is going about it the wrong way. iRating is a system designed to match you with drivers of a similar skill level. That’s all it is. And it’s doing its job. You don’t *want* a higher iRating right now. A higher iRating means you’d be with even faster drivers. Like others have said you may be getting rear ended a lot because you’re braking too early into corners or driving too slowly. It’s still generally the other guys fault but; there’s still a reason it’s happening. So you don’t necessarily want to be racing with drivers who are going to brake even later and go even faster, right?

Just keep at it and enjoy it! Or, I mean, don’t! But I think what needs to change is probably your expectations to better match reality."
"If you're getting rear ended that much, you are not practicing enough. Even for low iRating you need to get up to speed.


Have you tried running a practice season? Don't join any races - just do live test drives (join a race session after it has begun and click ""test drive"").


Without knowing more about how you're preparing for races, my assumption is that you're approaching this like a game when it's a sim. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be fun, but it's the same type of fun as a skilled hobby like playing music or painting miniatures. If you don't treat it at least semi seriously, you're not going to improve.


Depending on your disposable income - this might sound crazy - try coaching. Some people might laugh at the idea at such a beginner level, but you care enough to be here complaining about it, so you must want to be better."
"Try not to give a crap about iRating bs if you can't spend more time on this hobby. First, enjoy fatherhood because they grow up and quickly off too college & move to another city in a blink of an eye. Also try and race the series you're comfortable with and have fun."
"As others have said, ignore iRating. Just enjoy your race. Some of my most enjoyable races are having a solid scrap for 18th."
"Several thoughts:

1- sim racing can be a great hobby for dads, I think this hobby skews much older than most online competitive game genres. I've got a 4yo and a 2yo myself. Many of the people you'll be racing are also dads.

2- Every kid is different, and 1yo kids can be a big mental burden. Give yourself a break, if its stressful take a break from racing altogether or find a less stressful way to learn. I was getting really down by some negativity I was seeing in my F3 splits, so I took some time off iracing, did some WRC-rally, played cyberpunk etc, until I was ready, and once I was mentally ready I got back into iracing with different series (the Ringmeister and FF1600 trophy for now). You could try a different game, or race against the AI to work on your craft. The AI in iRacing is really good, and there are several other games that can help you learn technique and racecraft without the mental negativity (EA WRC for rally, AMS2, AC, etc).

3- Talent is highly overrated in simracing-- its all digital, so there is no equivalent of being a ""fat kid"". It's a \*skill\* based sport, and the skills may not be initially intuitive, or similar to how you drive in your road car. If I were you, I would focus on improving my skills much more than my race results. There are lots of resources for improving your driving. Youtube has a plethora of content on basic racing techniques. Consume a bunch of them to get an idea of the racing line, braking, etc. Books (either about real-life or sim racing) can be a good piece too (such as Speed Secrets by Ross Bentley, or especially the Motor Racing Book by Suellio Almeida). Youtube also has many individual track guides, to show you what is possible with a car/track combo and what you should be aiming for (and what others will generally expect you to do as well on track, which can help with preventing getting rear-ended).

4- As others stated, don't focus much on iR. Once you get your skills up (particularly your ""spidey sense"" for danger) you will gain massive chunks every race until you reach a good equilibrium.

5- I think it's a feature not a flaw that this hobby is hard. If you could master it within weeks, it would seem pretty hollow, no? It's a deep-skill hobby that allows you to grow with it for years, so that the learning/improving/mastery process can still keep you mentally engaged over decades.

Good luck fellow dad, you've got this!"
I would say just stick with what you're doing. You've already paid for the subscription so might as well just race when you find the time. Don't bother with buying new content because if you decide it's not for you and let your subscription lapse I'm pretty sure you just lose everything you've bought. The subscription content should be enough to keep you busy with the time you have available. All racers are better people after they grind through an ego check. Once I realized I wasn't gonna be anywhere close to the fastest I decided essentially to cosplay as a self-funded field filler and I'm pretty happy. I don't have to spend my fictional downtime at corporate events shmoozing with advertisers and executives and I can run whatever weird paint scheme I want 😄
"Maaaaannn, do I feel this post. I started just over a month ago and iRacing has given me more negative feelings than positive ones. I also have 2 young kids and can only get about 4 hours total playtime a week. So naturally, I'm slow as dog shit and I am absolutely hemorrhaging iRating. I have a very expensive computer that I'm very proud of, plus all the money I spent in sim racing gear. It definitely doesn't feel good to spend this much money, and more importantly -- time, just to feel like you suck *this bad.*

However, everything guys have been saying here is accurate. I was literally just looking at my telemetry on Garage61 right before I saw this post. I try to practice more than I race and I've stuck with just a couple of cars on the service (which is difficult with my severe ADHD). I've come to accept that I may just be a slow sim racer, but like John Cena taught me, I'm not giving up. I'm playing the long game because I might *not* be a slow sim racer in a year or two. Seeing posts like this and the positive response they get from the community is a big motivator and is what's keeping me on iRacing. This last week I've really turned a corner and have had a lot more enjoyment just running laps and analyzing my data. 

Trust me, man. We're right there with you."
"I was down to 500 road IR when I first got started about 18 months ago, now I’m pushing 2k. You’re driving the wrong car, pick a different one. If you’re driving the Mazda, start driving the FF1600 (or the Vee but pick one), and vice versa. 

Then, consider signing up for VRS (Virtual Racing School). It gives you a consistent target to work against and the data to analyze. Telemetry analysis can seem daunting at first but it becomes pretty intuitive quickly, and it’s the best way to figure out what you’re doing wrong. 

If you’ve done all of this, try picking up ovals for a bit - that’ll teach you how to drive around other cars and take some of the pressure off of the road side. You won’t feel as conservative once you’ve banged doors with Street Stocks at Charlotte."
"I’m in a similar situation to you with lack of time, I got as low as 600 ir as i raced too often with very little practice and too many different series. 
Now i race just a couple of series and only one or two races a week at most, I’m slowly climbing and am above 1000 ir. 
The worst part is in the bottomsplit you can get stuck as you are with them worst drivers and 1 bad race can ruin the progress you made in the last 4.
The biggest thing i learnt was how to communicate my intentions on track, for example hug the inside line to deter divebombs and tap the brakes to let the car behind know youre braking soon or pull to the right before braking so nobodies behind you."
"Don’t give up, it gets better as they get older. If I was in your shoes I would just learn one track for now. Maybe Lime Rock Park. There are a few different layouts and they all get a little use. Race the AI/ hotlap. When it comes up in the rotation for the MX5 go get a good race in and boost your irating. In that split if you can qualify up front you can avoid the carnage and possibly get a podium. 2 hours a week or so isn’t a lot of time so just hang on to it and try to have fun."
"1. Completely forget about iRating. It’s a number used to match you against similar abilities to try and make your race experience better. It’s not a number to determine whether you’re good enough for iRacing.

2. Are you enjoying the practice? Are you enjoying the races despite the struggles? This is the only metric you should use to determine whether you should be on iRacing. ( im like 2K+ and losing races and crashing out pisses me off sometimes and i need to take a break cos im not enjoying it)

3. There are loads of tutorials and apps to help you improve. Just focus on practicing you dont need to race if you dont feel ready. To determine whether youre ready id say be no less than 2 seconds off the pace for the split youre in. You can check by looking at the results of the previous races. 

4. Get ahead of the game. Start practicing for a race in two weeks time. "
"It is touched on in other replies.    You can be too conservative.   Practise and get your pace up, you don't have to race and you may quite like seeing your times progress as you practise more.   

Right now you are driving up to 2 hours per week and that time includes racing.   As a new racer, imo that is not  a lot of time for practising on tracks that i assume you are not entirely familiar with.

I would suggest don't worry too much about the racing and put more time in to practise, give yourself some goals to be within a certain time of the best times in the practise sessions.   You can still have a lot of fun seeing yourself improve.

When you do get on track for a race, do it just like you have been in practise..   If you have found the braking point that works, don't brake 50m early in the race to be cautious, it can catch people out and end in tears.

Where you can be cautious is fighting cars, if its looking dodgy then let them by, race yourself and get used to in race conditions doing what you had been doing in practise, the fact that there are other cars about is inconsequential.   It is perfectly fine for instance in a straight before a corner that you know will give you an issue if you go side by side to get off the throttle a bit and let them ahead until you have the confidence to race them there.

Forget about the irating, it is something that is needed with so many people to have good matchmaking but it is also quite a put off for many at the beginning.  It will climb and it is not unusual for many to have quite a dive at points along the way."
"I have 4 kids. Work a job, do a side hustle, play with my kids every day, get quality time with my wife and still get a race in every day… having a single 1 year old(who prob naps twice a day) is a silly excuse. Do more practice and less races till you stop crashing"
"Others are saying you shouldn't care about irating, but personally I can't imagine you having fun races if your irating is dropping so fast, so it should indeed be a concern.

I would just practice 1 car and 1 track for the time being and don't race until you improve a bit. Sticking with the same car and track will able you to follow your progress. 
Download garage61 and compare telemetry with other drivers. I'm guessing you are far off the pace, so good chance there's a big problem in your driving style that might pop right up."
"iRacing is the hardest Sim to drive physics wise and least forgiving contact model. I'd highly suggest getting a ps5 and giving Gran Turismo a go before you give up on Sim racing. There's plenty of fun, casual online racing to be had on GT7"
"I completely get you.  I am a 50 year old,  recently divorced fat dude, and I thought I was the best driver in the world.  Wrong!  I am not fast.  I don't have the time to practice for 4 hours a day.  I just want to jump on my rig when I feel like it and have fun.  I have pretty much given up on irating. My aim is to improve SR.  I want to not be in other people's way, but not be a wimp.  I just try to get my C license right now.  And only drive when I want to."
Get trophy.ai. Get garage 61. Drive drive and drive some more. Don't worry about ratings just do your pace. Things will start to click then the ratings and wins will come and you will be smiling. Don't get discouraged mate it's worth it.
"I think sim racing just takes time. I race one race about 5 nights a week. I get the half hour of practice before the race in general as well. It’s taken two years but I worked my way from a low of 400 up to nearly 2k. 
Never leave a race unless your repair time is longer than the time remaining. Try to stick to a minimum number of series.  
That was partially my problem. I wanted to race fast cars and would race in series that would split. "
"Honestly I find joining leagues far more enjoyable. Can just focus on your skillset and other drivers are very respectful (""sorry mate my bad"" as opposed to ""wtf you idiot"").

I'm just doing that I've wiped off chunks of time, vastly improved skills, can now feel when when I'm gaining and losing tenths, and can actually enjoy the game as opposed to worrying about someone torpedoing me in normal races."
"best i can say is LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES, genuinely watch replays, try to understand why you may have gotten hit, why u spun out, always practice before a race, if you cant practice for at least 30 minutes before a race to learn the car and track then just dont do that race, also if you wanna get better what i like to do is you can join officials races as a spectator and you can drive a ghost car and try to follow the top people . besides that youtube every track and car combo you run, try turning on racing line to better understand where to break and how to take your turns better, those would be my best tips, besides that more racing is the best way to get better"
"Dude you got a 1 year old? I have a 3 year old myself and I can’t fathom driving with that level of exhaustion. It took me a couple years before hobbies started to come back. Cut yourself some slack! You’re probably racing exhausted and the difference in my ability fresh vs exhausted is bonkers. You’ll get better, and the sooner you forget about iRating the more positive your experience will be. With such a tight schedule, give the time trials and AI racing a shot. The AI is well good enough that it’ll give you that thrill you are looking for without the logistics planning (and stress that comes with that) of participating in a scheduled event. 

Also, it’s just like any other sport, there will be amazing people out there that will just be so much better than you and probably forever. That’s where iRating really is really devious since you think it’s like gaining experience in a RPG, but it’s really just a hypothesis on how likely you are to win a race. If you think about it that way, then your iRating shouldn’t really get that much better until you’ve gotten much better, and that could take years! Just have fun man, enjoy those battles for 20th with the other guy of similar skill level lol

Remember, it’s just a game. It should bring joy, so do what brings you joy…and try and get some sleep 😅"
I'd worry less about the iRating and more about the DQs. How did you get past rookies? That's where you're meant to learn how to finish a race. Don't fret about iRating. In order for there to be an average there must be people below the average. So long as it's fun it doesn't matter. You already have a kid so it's not like you need the iRating in order to impress a potential mate 🤣 Which is probably actually more of a struggle for the very high iRating drivers.
In which series do you race?
"The too conservative part. Is that!  


1st) look for Suellio Almeida on YouTube. Excellent tutorials and no wasted time! You gonna love it. 


 2nd) Is not like you aren't for iracing but maybe you came to this game too early. Don't focus on wining, but enjoy the race. Learn how to battle and how to be consistent. iRating will rise and you are starting a not ending journey. Focus on to be better than yesterday."
"Spend less time racing other rookies and more time working on your pace. Races won't help much getting you faster, so don't do races, do laps. Choose the Vee or the Ray, whichever you like better, but try to focus on that one car. Those cars are going to help you understand how to control the car. Speed Secrets, VRS and active reset will help you get faster. If you haven't used any of those, you're nowhere near your potential. Once you're opening up your corners and you're able to steer with your feet, you'll be winning those bottom split Vee races in no time. :)"
"I had the experience as you. Dad of two but I still had 5-7 hours a week. I dropped to 500 thinking I would hit 200. I didn’t but even now if I join a specific hard series know it’s always possible. 

I know it’s very hard but forget about irating. Just drive and have fun. It is a big dedication to get fast and good race craft but if you can have fun it might take a while even a year or two but you will get there. Get a course like Suellio Almieda if you want to learn faster. If you forget about irating and learn how to race your irating will go up but everyone has a limit and feels inferior to others. The better people get they almost never win."
"Dad here (not yours), AI racing my friend. Configure how you want, single or season, use Trading Paints for custom liveries for you and the other (AI) racers (collections) to make it feel more alive and not a bunch of iRacing liveries.

Example, if you're into open wheel someone has made a dedicated F1 collection with all the driver names and 2023 liveries. Or create your own collection and get AI to randomise naming etc. 

Best of all, AI racing has a pause button! Used it many times to jump out and back in to tackle a family problem.

I've learnt more about race craft and tracks using AI than I did on a weekly race schedule and now I genuinely enjoy racing cars I once hated! 

AI racing won't help your iRating but it will give you a chance to race and have fun. The AI is not a train like some other games and each race is very different and as others have said, AI will crash and spin off to make it interesting! They also react to being pressured.

Don't let it get to you, your iRating can wait for another day!"
"I dropped to 100 irating at one point. I’d crash the car out tow and quit every race basically. I finally got it together and quickly moving up at 1500 now again. Just keep practicing, anyone can get better at this."
"Try a different series than what you normally run, just to switch things up. It’s not your job, just relax and try to have fun"
"Been playing for years.  This year has been the most fun.  I dont worry about wrecking,  it's going to happen. 
I dont worry about irating and just try to stay at least b class in oval.  

Other than that.  Hard racing and just be careful. An apology for overdriving does really far.  

I still swear draftmasters is the best series to learn close racing."
"I had the same thing when my kids were that small. Only a few years ago. Just race for fun, maybe focus on a few things each race like predicting and avoiding bad moments. Also practice driving off line. And finally, I’d say a god qually helps to get you ahead of the trouble, so learn to go quicker. A few ways to do this - use active reset in your private practice sessions. And also you can race as a ghost car (by watching a race and selecting to drive) - it’s a great way to race without damaging your irating."
"Ir is not the be all and end all of iRacing.

Sounds like you need to spend some time working on your technique as well as just getting quicker overall. There's tons of guides on YouTube etc

Instead of signing up for races, pick what you want to race and wait for the splits to get assigned servers, the higher the server number the lower the SoF if multiple splits. Click watch on whichever server you want to go into and once you load into the server you can then test drive as a ghost. This will enable you to practice racing without any risk to your IR or SR and if you go into a wall you can get a fresh car from the pits.

You will start races from pit lane so it can't help you learn turn 1. But if you can catch the back markers you can start to watch how they drive and start to improve. Even if you can't catch anyone, hold escape to go back into the replay view, find the leader and watch what they do from the cockpit view and then go out and try to emulate it.

You're not going to be fast straight away unless you've got alien skills. It's taken me years to go from being +5seconds off the fastest guys to now being closer to 3seconds off.

Also take time to make sure your controls are calibrated correctly both in iRacing and with the software it comes with. I played longer than I like to admit with a throttle that wasn't calibrated correctly and was hitting 100% throttle at 50% input. As soon as I got it calibrated correctly it made driving so much easier."
"My experience is a bit different. Really enjoyed mazda, ff1600. Got up to c class fairly easy. Paid 25 quid for one gt4 car and a track. 1 week later i need to pay out more for another track. I cant justify the cost and am sticking with ff1600 see how high my irating can get. Then acc for gt2 and gt3. I think LFM racing standards are less than iracing especially open wheelers. In gt4 iracing its a bit more like LFM ACC where everyone thinks they are driving a tank"
Wellll after about a year of hovering around 1200 and putting up with alll the crap I was fed up after being run over by as shit talking race leader who talked crap all the way around coming up on me again ordering me to get out of the way..Wellll I made a move to get out of the way directly in his way. Took him flat out and really don’t feel good about it I’d rather have just called him out old school an busted his mouth. So I’m like the kid waiting at the principals office after school. Who knows but this game sport whatever it is really works on people if you let it. Because I never snap under any conditions ever but today I did.
"Some people have hit on you probably driving too conservatively, which is just as bad as driving too aggressively. This is racing, not Sunday drive simulator, after all. If you're constantly having incidents, then you are the problem. Or rather, something you're doing is the problem. You really shouldn't be getting DQ'd in rookie and D class events as short as they are. 

One thing I see a lot of people do is ""practice"" but not actually have any sort of goal or plan and end up just driving around in circles without any purpose. You need to set goals and expectations for your practice sessions to get as much out of them as possible. My personal goal list is as follows:

1 - Learn track. Do 5 laps without incident.  
2 - Set lap time goal. See what qualifying times and race laps times are generally running and compare my lap times with them. If I'm way off, I'll jump into a race as a ghost car to see what I have wrong. You do this by observing an active race session.  
3 - Work on problem areas. With the new reset point system, you can practice areas on tracks that give you the most trouble and repeatedly practice them until you have them down.  
4 - Finally, match race pace/quali pace laps. Work on getting your lap times down closer to race pace.

Last, but not least, race. Especially in lower class cars, like the Vee or Mazdas. The races are short. The best way to improve your racecraft is to practice your racecraft. You do this by racing. At first, especially if you're a bit off pace, don't try and battle people. Just fall in line and follow. Just try and keep pace. Remember, watch the track, not other cars."
My iRating floats around 1500 to 1700. I swear that if it is at the upper end I just mess up (eg spin out on a slow corner) my next race and drop close to 100 iR. Need to not worry about iR and just enjoy racing but I find it hard to do.
"Give your self time bro, skip racing for a couple of weeks and just have fun with some music on in practice. You will start improving :)"
"If it’s fun, do it, if it’s not, don’t."
"Have you tried time trials? Might be a better sport for you at this time because it's just you racing around the track, trying to beat the clock."
"Hey new dad, I'm in a similar boat, though with a 3month old. The limited practice time is definitely tough.

What's your series and when do you usually play? How much racing do you consume outside of iRacing?

Even before baby, I had weeks/months where everything went wrong and my rating tanked, so don't get too discouraged."
At the end of the day who cares about iRating or SR.. it’s a game. Have fun. It shouldn’t be this serious.
"As I have said before here, I took a long, hard look at the classes I was driving and realised that they weren't for me. I did GT3 for ages and just didn't do very well, the level is quite high and takes more practise than I have time for (I'm also an adult with kids). I now do Mazdas, Vee and Street Stock mostly instead, and I am having a blast."
"Hi there! Have you thought about joining a league? Honestly I hate pubs and am only two months in. Even in top splits, people make dumb moves. In a league you face the same people every week so you know they aren't going to make dumb moves or they'll be penalized. 
I also learned a lot from the 3+ iR drivers, and we have a ton of 1000-1500 drives to race closely with and a few under 1k.
If you have any interest in mx-5 we race Tuesday evenings and the faster guys will practice bumper to bumper with slower people to help them get to speed faster. It's just a better community.
FYI irating means nothing in a league. No SR gained or lost or irating.
You need 3.0 Class D for the league I'm in. Pm me if interested.
Above all, as mentioned, please focus on having fun. If you aren't, don't keep doing the same thing and burnout.
P.s. I have more time than you so not directly fair, but my time is spent 95% practicing and 5% racing as I'm still learning dynamics and speed. The AI racing tip from others is a great one!"
"IRacing like any other esport requires a lot of practice just to be competitive. Don’t expect to win or compete upfront. You need a lot of practice to master the basics and techniques. It reminds me of StarCraft 2 1v1. People usually say you’ll loose around 100 games before winning 1. 

Competition is real and when you start, you are at the very bottom and it can be frustrating. That’s why it’s better to focus on deliberate practice (for example, this session, I’m going to practice trail braking) and set your own winning conditions (for example, this race, I’ll finish with 0x). It’s the best way to make progress"
"30m practice before joining a race is just not enough imo, especially for someone brand new.  I’m closing in on 1000 races and I still won’t jump into a race unless I’ve done a couple hours practice beforehand, unless it’s a car and track combo I’m super familiar with"
"Always good to keep this thread in mind  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/sulys4/more\_people\_should\_see\_this\_irating\_distribution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/comments/sulys4/more_people_should_see_this_irating_distribution/)"
"Don’t quit, I myself have had a few bad days that took me from my measly little 1.5k irating down to 900! I thought to myself why the hell am I even trying.. then I decided to not worry about that rating. I jumped into a race qualifying at last place (lol) I then found myself being more aggressive at trying to gain some positions from my poor qualifying, I noticed that when I was in the back it gave me time to watch the other horrible drivers crash and  so I could squeeze in past. So I thought maybe if I just try starting at the back maybe I’ll be a little better. Well I’m hindsight I did get better I got a chance to read the drivers and the lines they took and I learned very quickly how to overtake safely and to be a tad bit more aggressive! I know it’s different for everyone but don’t give up you will get better and learn from your past races. I also highly recommend saving and watching replays. It will help you understand where you might have went wrong or help you understand where to steer clear at and let the faster guys go by. Anyways good luck brother!"
"https://preview.redd.it/qmvxvz6xxldc1.jpeg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4d083c031803a83c3f76c40c0602889cf798517

Suck it up. That's how learning works. You suck at first and then get better. Don't be a bitch"
"Irating is there to keep you with a competitive field. The downside is the real low irating races, in my experience, tend to turn into a wreckfest. But starting out I won many races by being patient and avoiding all the crashes. 

Personally I don't worry too much about safety and irating. As long as I'm having fun and not ruining anyone else's race it's worth it to me. So I guess you gotta ask yourself what you want out of it. 

There is always Assetto Corsa if losing irating is ruining the experience."
"I like the idea of coaching.   There are many people who will offer a free coaching session, heck, I'd just jump into an open practice session with you and get on discord and talk for 30 minutes or an hour just for the hell of it no charge.  Feel free to DM if you want."
"Ignore your iRating. 
Don’t drive too conservatively. Drive that bitch like you belong."
"Just DNQ and stay in the back in rookies, You be surprise when everybody wrecks and your in 4th place. when your confident and had more practice time with a track, qualify and race up front."
"It is hard to ignore the iR (and I struggle with it too) but you just gotta keep in mind that it is simply a number used for match making. It just puts you in a split where it belongs. That is it. Just enjoy yourself and keep going. You'll eventually land where you belong. Whether that is 200 or 2000 iR, the end result is the same if you just focus on your race.

Keep it casual and don't worry *too much* about practicing etc. Provided you can be safe, even if you are slow. You did mention getting into some incidents so just get better at surviving. And by surviving I don't mean start from the pits or driving way behind everyone else. Be an active participant in the race, even if people do end up overtaking you. From there you can focus on building pace."
"I’m betting most people that struggle have an improper field of view. I’ve attached a good video to set it up correctly but moral of the story, if it’s too wide.. you’ll feel as if you’re going a million miles a second. If it’s too narrow, you’ll feel like you’re driving slow but at other costs.. both cause excessive tire wear and wrecks. Proper FOV is the single best change you can make without spending money.

Run oval. Less practice and still fun
iRacing isn't game where you hunt for high rating per season and tryhard in premades. The rating is there just to get you opponents of similar skill level; not something to grind upwards. If you're enjoying the race then it doesn't matter if you're 500 or 3500 rating.
I understand getting caught up In irating cause it happens to me too. But don’t Rae for irating. Race to race and have fun regardless of the split your in.
"Racing is for everyone. It's also hard. You may just need to practice more or better. Are you comparing your telemetry in any way? Watching track guides? Just doing wrong hotlaps won't make you better. Are you using active reset in practice?

Driving is a skill and it takes time to develop properly.  iRating doesn't matter. Focus on the fundamentals. It's also ok to be bad as long as you're having fun.

I've only put in 8 solid weeks over two seasons because I'm busy too. I don't win. Can occasionally get top 5 or bronze."
"Who cares about irating if you’re not having fun , you need to keep a personal fun rating."
Sort answer: no. Fortunately there are a lot of good sims for a fraction (I.e. 1/100) of the iRacing cost.
"Dude just race against AI. Practice against real ppl, race against AI. you get the feeling of real ppl from Practice but race your own pace with AI"
"My dude I feel this so deeply. I tried iRacing in 2014 on the back of a recommend from a friend who knew I liked forza. It really bummed me out how shitty I was, and I sold the gear and stopped. (Had babies and toddlers too!)

I returned to it over the last two years and have found a better relationship based on a few factors:
- I’m older now, and am fine being just okay
- I’ve realized I need to practice a track more than I imagined, and only with the race line off. I strive to learn a track like I have learned my drive home from work
- I don’t beat myself up about taking weeks (or months!) off from racing. Just enjoy it when you have the time and energy."
"You probably are not unlucky with DQs , you just do not play enough to be consistently good, im not sure with your experience in simracing, but averagely it takes more than 10 hours on track to drive consistently, to drive consistently good it may take hundreds of hours on single track, you obviously dont have that time. The thing is that until you enjoy the game there is always a reason to play. You are getting your fair irating and you will play with the same type of guys who does not have so much time to spend for a game"
"You might be right on. I'll need to go back and look at some replays to see maybe I'm being too slow. I don't typically move out of the racing line unless I'm overtaking or under the blue flag, so it's not often I just make room for the faster cars on purpose. If they get inside I'd try to stay wide and that generally helps me avoid crashes. I watch track guides and usually follow the same braking points, so it's not like I'm braking unusually early. But I think you are right about me taking responsibility too"
"Yeah the whole point of the irating system is so you race people of similar skill, judged by pace and race finishes

If op is parking on the apex and 4 seconds off pace, his irating is going to reflect that"
"Honestly at that level, I would waste less time in practice sessions and more time racing. I’m sure you hit a plateau well before that 1h of practice mark, and racing against other people will teach you more of that race craft you seem to be lacking for now. Also you’ll soon have more fun than you seem to have for now. I’m not saying don’t learn the cars/tracks, but the priority for you now it to learn how to have fun."
"This.  The AI in iRacing are soooo good and so much fun.  It's mostly what I do just because I'm a ""race what I want,when I want"" kind of guy"
I'll do single AI races on occasion especially to learn new tracks. I'll set the AI ability 30-100 and reduce the fuel capacity to force early pitting. AI actually do wreck each other which cause yellows.
Great advice - maybe focus on 1 or 2 tracks using AI. Just improve racecraft and pace. Take learning tracks out of the equation for awhile.
"This is really great advice, the AI is unlike any other racing series, it’s very hard to tell them apart from actual drivers."
I 100% need to take this very wise advice.
An increase in irating means an increase in skill so...... How do we reconcile this?
Spot on! Great advice. 👍🏻
"I agree with you here, I found that often my rear end collisions are because I am braking earlier than the rest of the pack which unsettles the cars behind me. Practice + watching others race tends to help out here."
">Depending on your disposable income - this might sound crazy - try coaching. Some people might laugh at the idea at such a beginner level, but you care enough to be here complaining about it, so you must want to be better.

Honestly, coaching works better when you're an absolute beginner because you don't have any bad habits to undo and you don't have the mistaken impression that you're already good at this."
Yeah I tried and frankly I didn't care too much when I dropped below 1000 for the first time. But getting down to 500 really was a big ego hit.
"Picking a track that is coming up in a few weeks, using that time to practice it, then finally racing when it comes up, is a good way to maximize the practice and actually be competitive in the race."
What how? Do you sleep?
"Yeah I'm dead tired every min of my day lol, the little one doesn't hardly sleep, so I'm usually trying to rush and only do a race right before going to bed because most likely I'm up at 3am for 2 hours... 

I might try to take a break and do ai racing more. The stats really do stress me out any way I look at it. It's not easy to just forget the iRating because I don't think anyone could easily admit they suck. I wish there's more of a casual vs. Ranked thing maybe, so I can just race without feeling the pressure."
"I actually was decently safe in rookie mx-5 and SR went almost to 3. The production car mx-5 series kicks my butt and I think that's even more chaotic than the rookie series because of the multi class aspect. 

I think I'm gonna stick to ai for a bit in the near future until I have more time to practice. I usually just do lap practices to get my lap time close to par, but the race craft stuff I really need to learn more about. It seems I'm way behind on that"
"Road, production car and gt4. I usually do mx-5 in the production car series. I prefer gt4 but I don't always buy the tracks knowing I could only play 1-2 times on it for that week"
Nice job not giving up! Maybe theres hope for me still!
I was decent at rookie Mazda and went into gt4 from there. Spent some time in Gt4 and almost won a few races but I didn't want to spend 15 bucks on a new track if I know I won't get enough track time on it due to family obligations. If I switch back to mx-5 for a week then I'm totally messed up... I might try open wheel to see if that's any better
That's why I turn off chat. They can yell all they want. I'm in a racecar and can't hear them at all.
Man I never turn on the voice chat. I don't need more negativity lol
Hmm never tried it. Honestly I thought it was about sitting lap times which I knew I wouldn't be good enough.. I'll check it out!
"Yeah very true. I did buy the 2 year sub so if I want, I could just stop buying new contents"
"btw imo generally chasing rating , elo , mmr in any game brings you more frustration than joy. Firstlt you enjoy the game and if you gain rating - good , if you stay at one rating or decline - nothing bad, the game still fullfils its main purpose to pring good emotions and rest"
"I’ve been on the service less than 3 months and that was a realization I had to come to as well. Some folks on this sub will say things like “if you’re constantly involved in the wreck you are the problem” and it took me a few weeks to realize that they were right. What took me longer to understand about the safety rating/license system was that it does not matter so much if you finish first or last but rather how safe you are. The SR works as a metric of incidents per corner. The more corners and more laps you string together without incident the more you are rewarded. As far as iRating is concerned, that is a zero sum metric. Basically everyone in the split pools their rating and people lose some, others gain some. The thing you should focus on most is wreck avoidance. It’s good that you’re recognizing flaws in your driving style. Try to remember this; race how you want to be raced. If you were a faster car and a slower car isn’t being courteous, how would you feel? The same goes for battling wheel to wheel. You can be aggressive and fair at the same time, that in itself is race craft.

The cool thing about iRacing is the number of different series and racing forms you can try. If you’re only doing road racing, try ovals! Dont worry about your iRating or other metrics so much. Focus on being safe and not getting incident points and begin to ramp up the speed.

One last thing; do try your best to not use the driving line. It’s good for learning new cars and tracks you’re unfamiliar with BUT the braking lines are quite conservative and the line itself can cause target fixation which is detrimental to others around you. Plus, at lower iRating splits, most people are quite unsafe and the biggest thing you learn is how to identify and avoid those folks. The number of positions you gain from that will be insane. Remember, in order to finish first you must finish. Don’t get discouraged. It’s a journey in the most realistic racing simulation game ever created.  Drive safe, and wins will come. You got this shit."
"I've come once again, to recommend suellio almeida  
he has a lot of free coaching advice / shorts that are really helpful.

[https://www.youtube.com/@SuellioAlmeida](https://www.youtube.com/@SuellioAlmeida)"
"He probably is. Braking too early easily results in getting rear ended, and most of the time you wouldn’t realize it’s your fault"
"For a longtime when I first started I was braking way too early and it resulted in getting rear ended a ton, find someone with a higher IR in practice and try and stick with them and see where they brake. Spectate and find out as well."
">under the blue flag

just fyi, the blue flag in iracing is informational only and not an actual requirement to get out of the way. most of the time, the best you can do is be predictable and hold your line, it's up to faster car to overtake safely , which is much easier done when the car being overtaken is behaving predictably and holding their line."
Hopefully Ethan takes your advice
"I hopped back in Assetto Corsa after a year or so and my god the AI are terrible compared to iRacing’s AI. They make insane moves all the time, block you, swerve all over the place, brake in the middle of the corner, it was crazy. Most of all though I had to keep reminding myself that I wasn’t racing against real people! I would expect them to like leave me space or not run into me mid corner and they would just run me off the road. Made me miss iRacing lol"
"I’m not sure what you mean? Sorry if I’m being dense 😂, but I don’t quite understand your comment."
"The thing with iracing is that the fat kids are grouped up together and the fit kids are grouped up together. And you know what, the fat kids enjoy a good maccies and a beer after a game while the fit kids have to keep grinding to be better. Embrace the inner fat kid."
It’s hard for some people to accept that they aren’t good at some skill. It’s totally ok. Not everyone can be good. That’s why bell curves exist. Some people must be on the lower end of the curve. Just accept you might be a slow race car driver and find a way to have fun. And if you can’t have fun then simply racing probably isn’t for you. Nothing wrong with that. No one is forcing you to enjoy it. You shouldn’t do something that you don’t enjoy.
"I get it. But remember that there are ALWAYS people faster and slower than you, regardless of iRating. I'm 2600 and I'm usually at the back of top split, lapping 2 seconds slower than the leaders. There are 6000 iR racers looking at the 8000 iR racers wishing they were that fast. And there are 500 iR racers chasing the 1000 iR racers.

The internet really does have a knack for making us all feeling average or rubbish about our abilities. I realised that when I started playing Chess online. Having been a decent high school player, suddenly I realised half the world was better than me!

Just gotta change the mindset (easier said than done!) and enjoy the battles you have on track."
"It's sounds like you are fairly new to this. iRacing takes practice and the general level is high. With only 2 hours a week it's going to take a while to get competitive even in the bottom split. This isn't a skill issue it's an experience issue. 

Up to you whether you enjoy putting in the work to slowly get faster and faster. For me it was about focusing on lap times in the beginning, finding those few extra tenths of a second. Once I was in the ball park of other drivers in my split, then I would focus on racing.

Took me a long time to get decent and actually be able to race well."
There are unranked races but I don’t think there is much participation unfortunately. Finding a league is a good option too.
PCC is a very aggressive series to be fair.
Try some oval racing.  Getting up to speed on the track is way faster because you only have to learn 4 corners. Also the racing is a ton of fun.
"One possible solution can be to drive less series, so you know the car better.
You could choose mx 5 & f1600 for example (or just one of both). Both have rookie and class D series. 2 hours a week are less. It should be at least a slower car, makes things easier. I love the GR68 series for example. 

Maybe you can extend it to 3 hours and do 2h practice and 1h racing (~2 races) a week. 

At the start of a week, go and check what the pole Q lap time is and then watch a track car combo guide. Try to get as close or better than pole time in your IRating split and you are much safer on staying alive than in the middle or back of the field. If you are able to set a good Q time you race online, otherwise you stay in practice mode or race AI, which will let you better understand the car. In the following week ti will be a bit easier, because you learned a lot.

Check out Suellio almeida on youtube and get his book on kindle unlimited or printed version. you definitly find some time on the way to work or whatever to read a bit. This will help you a lot."
"I do the production car series in the Mustang pretty regularly, but I’m also decent in the MX5. I really like helping people get comfortable side by side, so if you want some help with your practice time shoot me a DM. I’ve found that a lot of people just want to hot lap in practice, but I think that’s the best time to get used to having someone close to you and dealing with it. 

I have as much fun running laps with people in practice as I do racing. Haha. 

Also, I have a less limited, but somewhat limited schedule like you, so picking one series might be your best bet for improvement if you care about stats. I make a point to get one race in production cup each week, sometimes I do some dirt late model to change it up. But jumping around is hard at first because cars drive differently. 

I’m serious about practicing with you though. I’ve been on since 2011-ish and it used to be a lot easier to get good practice in with people back then."
Ye man im just gna stick to ff1600 and not buy tracks
"It's about going around the racetrack as quickly and as safely as you can. Any 1x blows the lap, and you have to string 10 together to get a completion. It is quite challenging in and of itself comparing your times to other drivers."
"Oh yeah, and watch the iRacing driving school videos. If you watch them through the member site you get an achievement!

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqZLBOpI5JFKebBA_i-SCkGRRypXovWv6&si=TSwCVLaw9fKO_ak5"
"At first I was dismissive of Suellio due to his young age, and I have never been more wrong. That ""kid"" has likely forgotten more about racing than I will ever know. I watched one of his videos and was half a second faster consistently within half an hour of practicing just one thing. I am absolutely sold on him now."
Yes. This man is 🐐
"And too much. He said he’s following the braking points on track guides, but if you over-slow that’s also a recipe for disaster."
Watch track guides on YouTube
Edited. Sorry
"If iRating is only a matchmaking tool and nothing more then what does it mean if you're rating never increases? That means you're not getting better because it's not possible to win races or place well and not have your rating increase at the same time. I don't understand saying that you won't want a higher rating because you grow by racing faster racers and your ability to do well against higher competition is reflected by your rating. 


Ultimately it depends on your goals. If you want to actively and measurably be better then your irating is that measuring stick. If you just want to have fun when not care how objectively good you are then yeah rating is whatever. Either path is fine, but it's up to the individual what iRating means to them. For me personally I DO care about my rating for the reasons I mentioned. So that's why I ""take issue"" with saying it doesn't matter. It depends."
"> bell curves exist. Some people must be on the lower end of the curve.

I'll remember that line the next time a beggar asks me for change.

/s"
"Yeah well said. I've been trying to think of my iRating as a match-making number, rather than a skill number, and that has helped me change my mindset, personally. Id recommend OP thinks about it this way too!"
"Appreciate it man, that's why I love this community! I'll shoot you a dm !"
"He was a high level concert pianist, and applied that level of practice work ethic to iracing.  The results speak for themselves."
You should remember that for everything. Time doing something most certainly does not equate to skill. Plenty of people do things for 10-20 years and are worse than people who have done it for 1 or 2. Lots of factors play into how much you learn something.
"No need to be sorry, was just joking about it lol"
"i think the point is that irating is a reflection of skill, but irating shouldn't be your reason to race, having fun and improving should be your reason to race. as you naturally get better, your irating will follow and keep you matched with people near you skill wise"
"Yeah, same. iRating just helps me guarantee a fun time. As long as it gets me into the rough ball park (back end of top split or mid pack in middle split) then I'm happy."
Happy to help!
"Keep in mind at your IR, you're already in the top 15-18%% of drivers. So if you hop in a brand new vehicle against people who drive it exclusively, you will of course be down in pace. Just practice some more, analyze, and practice again. You'll get to a good pace pretty soon."
"what series are you coming from? 


if you're coming from GT4 you'll have an easier time than if you're coming from open wheel "
"This is not a good track to be introduced to GT3 racing do don't be too disenchanted yet.  I'm 2.0k and usually 1.5-2.0 secs of top runners but here I'm struggling to keep within 2.5secs.  This series is very competitive so the level of competence is high.

But.... practise, practise, practise and watch online hotlaps.
Setups do help (paid or just use the iracing supplied sets, I swap between the high and medium downforce sets usually)."
No I tried gt4 but think I chose the wrong car in the M4 couldn't get my head round it. But I do a bit in Porsche cup I'm about average in that
"I bought the m4 gt4 and loved it, but then I also bought the Porsche and the Mercedes as I was running a lot of gt4 races. And now I hate the gt4, it feels like I’m driving a bus now. So I definitely recommend trying a different gt4 car as it’s a good category imo. 

The merc seems like the best bet personally"
"Twitch ads have gotten pretty bad, in my opinion. I've spent far less time on Twitch recently as a result.

It's annoying to be met with ads when you first click on a stream. Really discourages me from clicking around to streamers I've not watched before, and therefore know whether or not I'll want to keep watching past the 30 seconds of ads that pop up first. Discovering new/small streamers is already a big problem and this only makes it worse."
You discovered commercials are annoying (shocking) and decided to pollute our feeds with a screenshot of one?
"There are mobile ad blockers that will block all the Twitch bullshit. If you cant find one, DM me."
try using Russian VPN 😉
does subscribing remove ads?
"Yeah you are right, just invest 50€ every month so you can watch your 10 favorite streamers adfree. /s"
Twitch Turbo? Ad free on all channels for like $12 (local price may vary)
Single screen sure... Triples / VR might be a stretch
Not using triples or VR. Just single 34 ultra wide.
"And what have you tried so far then?
Think the first thing probably being recommended is reinstalling the content you have a problem with"
I've done that I've renamed iracing to racing.old I've also done the car.old and so far that's all they've told me to try
Welp. Looks like it won’t run on Linux anyway. I’ve got Windows loaded on it - and it’ll run iRacing… but I have an OLED deck and the WiFi drivers for Windows aren’t yet released.
That can happen in a real mx5 race too fyi
Dont mind the overly generic ChatGPT response. Mostly looking for the categories/types of information I should be considering when practicing
https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3770438.page give this a read itll answer all your FFB questions
"Short answer, check the use custom controls for this car check box. 

Set up all your universal buttons first though. Those will then be the same for everything. Then the first time you drive a car after that go in and check that box, then set up your ffb for it. It will now be set for that car only."
Why shouldn’t you get damage from hitting a cone? That wouldn’t happen in real life with a front wing at speed.
Why not? Seems realistic. I’ve shattered a carbon fiber splitter IRL with a similar move.
"You should get damage for hitting cones.


But there should be far fewer cones. iRacing has this weird obsession with spamming cones everywhere there's an alternate configuration. Sometimes even essentially touching the racing line.


Edit: just checked and there's no cones there IRL."
Carbon fiber is stronger than you think.
"Well, my thinking was that when F1 cars' front wings hit the spinning tyre of another car, the front wing endplates often come off, but not always. If carbon fiber can withstand hitting a spinning tyre, it should withstand hitting a cone. I won't doubt your first hand experience though."
You completely misunderstand the TYPE of strength carbon fiber has. It's strong under a load. But brute impact causes it to shatter.
It’s still going to take some damage if you run over a road cone at near full speed
I've seen people crack bumpers at autocross events hitting a cone. Complaining about this is dumb. It's realistic.
"Okay, but the next race someone lost control in front of me and I got a 0x for touching him but no damage. How is hitting a cone more damage than touching a spinning car?"
Hitting a stationary object at speed is different than hitting a moving object. The speed differential matters in terms of impact force.
Because a cone is stationary
They just put when they run out of fuel
I Find AI dumb with fuel stops. Even with pit risks low they were still running out of fuel during my practice races at Daytona Road
"On road courses, they just put when they are out of fuel or tires are shot.

On ovals there is more strategy, particularly if you throw some random cautions.  I run a random timer app on my phone with a range of 5 minutes to 1 hour.  When it goes off I throw an admin caution.  Depending on timing, the strategy can get interesting!"
"Not my experience. Yes they all have the same strategy of only pit when out of fuel when there are no yellows, but that makes sense.
If you have a SC then differences in strategies will occur depending on when the yellow occurs, potentially forcing the individual ai to make different choices.

 I just did a 500 mile at fontana with the ir18 and had 3 cautions. It caused different pit strategies because at 1 sc period half the field (on the lead lap) pitted and the other didnt."
all on the same lap ? or within a few laps of each other ?
"Within a few laps, usually the slowest drivers end up going an extra lap or two."
"Also it would be nice if people showed some respect for yellow flags, the other day on lap 1, theres was I incident and most if the LMPs slowed and avoided the guy who crashed, but when we slowly started maneuvering through the crash, the GT4s came at full speed and destroyed all the LMPs who had respected the yellow."
"I remember one race on the mountain chaotic first lap guy ended up pointing at wrong way and bacause i didnt know exactly where to go I just jumped on brake and we ended up just staring eachother for good few seconds

Good times ruined the race but it left funny memory thats still there after few years"
Protest and move on
Good ol mount crashorama
I'm kidding - but it's not very realistic for cars to just magic away. I think iracing should add a feature that forces everyone to wait in the pits while a crane truck removes the damaged/stuck car.
"

‘I’m just gonna crash my big ass car in the dipper so it’s horizontal and try a dumb ass 23 point turn so I don’t have to tow’

If you’re looking for these type of drivers I can point you to a few series"
Can't wait for the 12hr.
"Bro, they pay for the service. YOU’RE not the main character & YOUR race isn’t more important than other drivers races. Some players pay & play for the immersion. Wrecks happen in racing & being wrecked by a wrecked driver driving back to the pits also happens in racing. 

There’s nothing about what you just typed in the Sporting code."
Literally has happened to me every time at Bathurst. I liked Dayton but ruskodgen and Bathurst are pretty toxic. Last seasons schedule seemed to be a lot better imo
"I don’t do much multiclass racing but I definitely see a lot of folks on this subreddit talking about folks in the faster cars being perhaps less skilled or less racecrafty than the people who choose to race the slower cars.

Would folks support using iRating instead of license class to determine eligibility for cars in multiclass races? Or would that just be a nightmare? Been watching some RL Daytona 24 highlights and thinking about the fact that generally speaking, the fastest cars in Daytona are not driven by the less experienced or less talented drivers. Just because, well, the folks who have those seats to offer can be more selective about who they put in them."
This post reminds me I still have to assign the tow-function to a button on my wheel !
Wasn’t brave enough to do the multi class this week for that very reason. Stuck with TCR and had some great races
"Magic tow is unrealistic, it's supposed to be a sim."
Agreed. But unfortunately very few people are going to respect the yellow flags until they actually make it a penalty to pass under them.
"A few months ago there was a crash ahead just past forest elbow I slowed down and the car behind me (that was 4-5 car lengths back)didn’t and rammed into the back me into the car that was stopped and went around us.

I protested but got the ‘we don’t feel it was intentional’ email.

There own code says it’s a black flag. 

It’s not the first time this has happened 

The stewards do not care about people speeding through yellow flags.

In fact, I’ve come to the realisation that many times you’re better off not slowing because chances are the guy behind you won’t.

If you have a ton of space by all means but 90% of drivers see a yellow flag and see it as an opportunity to get an advantage. 

Until Iracing take yellow flags seriously it’s not going to change."
"Done for sure, just hoping everyone else who saw it did so too lmao"
Right. I love hotlapping it. I do not like racing on it
Had this in Geoff Crammond Grand prix in 1991
"Found em in the gt4 challenge myself, but yeah i believe you lmao"
Im trying my first 2hr tomorrow lmao I cant wait either
My guy. Just no.
Lol
Those certainly are words that form an opinion...
"I would not support that. SR is quite literally designed for this purpose. Improving it could be an option, but removing it would make things so much worse. Many people would be way past the cutoff threshold, and I don't really want all those people driving around with no concern for contact with other cars."
"I really wish we had a virtual safety car type system. Similar to what’s in F1. 

Basically once you hit a yellow flag sector you have a delta you can’t exceed. Forcing you to slow down. If you don’t; you get penalized."
"Moreover, without a safety car, anyone ahead of the crash is just completely checked out from the rest of the field. Without any incentives to make every position count for something, it means the only thing most people will care about are wins. If they get stuck behind a crash and lose touch with the leaders, the reality that they are racing for nothing sets in, and most people would rather try to thread the needle at full speed. 

I understand why the system is the way it is right now, and it certainly seems like iRacing is satisfied with it exactly as is. Unfortunately, the knock-on effects are not as satisfying for the people actually racing within it. If upper license ovals can get a safety car, I don’t understand why upper level road racing can’t. Especially with the spectre of rain looming, safety cars for road races will be more important than ever."
Not to mention everytime I ease up for a yellow I get creamed from behind. Then the inevitable tongue lashing from the dude that smacked me from behind screaming at me for slowing down.
It would be cool if by proximity to the accident everyone who was close enough and got a yellow had like 1.5 seconds to get off the accelerator and who ever doesn’t gets a slow down.
My God I loved that game.
You guys complain as much as the drivers do
"Yeah, this is exactly what happened in the incident I mentioned, I got messages from a couple of 4k+ GT4 drivers asking why I didn’t teleport to the pits and wjy was I seating in the middle of the road? I was like are you fking serious? Why would I teleport to the pits when my car was perfectly fine cause I didn’t hit anyone and I actually respected the yellow, and his answer was “you still shouldn’t be blocking the road…??? What? So was I supposed to plow through like they did?"
The field of view is set independent of resolution. You can set via the options pages or I think the keys are \[ and \] to edit while in the car.
"Oh, ok so I should increase FOV"
Wdym? It's literally a great tactic that takes a great amount of skill to pull off as well as they are.
Would you have made this post if it wasn’t Verstappen in the team? People have been doing it all month and now it’s an issue?
"its the other way round atm

been watching for maybe 50 mins, its quite impressive to watch"
"HOW DARE teammates work together, what a disgrace.  


Should be put in JAIL."
I've not been watching but I don't like teams bump drafting or plain having cars in splits to organise a draft in a road race. Not against the rules but it is a bit against the spirit of it.
"It's an amazing display of skill, but since it's not a team event it means any team driving a single car has no chance of winning


but I guess everyone knew that going in so I dunno"
Verstappen fans hahaha
"I don't really think it should be allowed because it's not a team race. If it were a team race I'd be 100% for it, but the reality is, this gives a very significant advantage to the very few teams that can field two vehicles in the top split and I don't really feel like that's fair."
Yeah I wouldn't dare do that out of fear of damage or spins. To do it consistently and not lose time from overspeeding into T1 is neat
"Yeah I love to see it but the cross teaming, is that allowed? Reminds me of another race where a crashed car, from the same team, went racing to protect the other car."
Agreed with this. It takes a ton of skill and I respect the hell out of being able to do it that consistently for that long but is a bummer for any of the single car teams and it also doesn't really make for a particularly entertaining race for viewers either.
Nothing stopping single car teams to make partnerships with other single car teams.
"if you owned a team that was good enough to have multiple top split cars, youd tell them to work together. dont lie to yourself."
And to be doing it for as long as they're doing. Crazy skills
"that was Williams and they didn't go racing, they blocked the freakin pit plane"
" this is nothing like that at all...one car was waiting at the pit lane for laps at a time to impede. this is two cars on track working together. there is nothing in the rules against this and it does happen in IRL racing, mostly nascar though."
"What even is cross teaming? It's just team mates helping each other, there is nothing wrong with it."
Well duh of course I would. They did nothing wrong because it's not against the rules. But I think it SHOULD be against the rules.
"It doesn’t care about any individual driver’s iRating, it’s the team iRating to determine total gain/loss, then split by drive time. He had the most laps, so he lost the most."
"He did one lap more. So I guess he just had the bad luck of rounding after the division.

Edit: afaik only your teams average irating matters in determining how much irating your team as a whole gains or loses and only your share of driving matters determining how much of your teams gain or loss is placed on you."
"The team gains/loses a total amount, and it's distributed proportionally to laps completed. Looks like due to rounding there was an extra -point that needed to go somewhere, so it went to the driver with the most laps."
"Street stock. Hit your marks. 

Honestly just get out there and start practicing. You’re in for a big surprise. Most “road” only guys are very pleasantly surprised how fun and actually challenging ovals are."
Well the only rookie oval car that has ranked races is the street stock 
Street stocks are the better preparation for NASCAR style stock cars. But I think the legends car is still more fun
"I feel this. I was mostly doing F4 and I'm a huge Nascar Fan. So I decided to do Oval and wow the action is more intense. Crashes happen but unlike Formula i just say ""Oh well, it's Nascar."" Honestly grinding for IndyCar because the cars are that much faster. Nothing to the sport I love but I might be going to try to even watch more IndyCar to learn.

P.S Also Changing road to IndyCar B. Working fir that grind"
"Street Stock is a blast, what you should really try is DIRT oval!!! Now that's some fun"
This is true!  I never realized how much strategy and how technical it really is.  I always thought it was just a bunch of rednecks driving in circles.  Boy was I wrong!
"Rookie legends are out there, too. 

Fun if you want to go the short track route. Or just like chaos."
Thanks! What’s the deal with drafting/bump drafting/working as a team? Obviously it works in real life but doesn’t that cause incident points in iracing?
Indycar oval also going to B next season btw but yeah it’s fun
"No, if you are bump drafting properly (easing in at not much speed difference) it is a 0x."
Thanks for letting us know. Guess I need to work on that license more.
Everyone take note. THIS is how you clip your highlights properly. 👏🏻OP
"This is interesting, usually SF has multiple splits.  I am always in a split full or racers matched with my IR + or - no more than 2-300.  Is it track or time specific?  I've not done a race at Atlanta yet this week.  


Edit\* seeing another post, Daytona 24 and ROAR also probably has a role to play this week."
I just wanna know what’s censored?
I absolutely loved road atlanta with sf
looks like he slowed down to let you pass on the inside.
He was pulling left and slowing early to let all of yall by before the downhill because he knows thats a death sentence to pass in and he knew he was a lapped car.
SF single split lobby? What time zone are you running in I always see 2 full splits
Thanks for the replay. Mostly just people saying they get purposefully murdered all day every day with zero video or just videos from some guys phone over and over looking for rig props
Nice reactions / save 👍
I commend this sportsmanship 🤝
lol what was on your halo you censored
Imo it's crazy to sign up for a race being THAT uncomfortable with car/track combo
"I love iRacing, but this is the only big frustrating thing for me. I'm still in my first month and within my first 50 races I believe, so still learning. But that means when I'm in a server full of rookies I can fight quite a big group of fella newbies.

However. There's always 1-3 races which are like 1-3 seconds faster than the rest. So winning is out of the question. Especially when they use custom setups that really make a difference.

Second part of why that's annoying is exactly what happens here. With other rookies we don't go too close to each other in practise. We know we all brake (much) earlier to get to know the tracks and cars. Even after offline practise. But when there's these rocket-speed guys behind us, it makes it extra difficult to learn without causing any trouble."
"If you see, 600ir in front off you, did you expect he will race as same as you?

Obvious will be breaking early and paying attention where he is ;-)

UPD: Many overlays like RaceLab or iOverlay have relatives with iRating. Very useful in multiclass like IMSA or in series where possible single split.

People you are insane, I love you all, 34 persons was offended and downvoite me because of first sentence of my first two sentences. You are wild. Lol 😂"
"Awe, you poor baby.  I hope your ego is okay."
"They gotta tweak the split system, this is dangerous and should never happen. And it's even worse if it's multi class racing"
It took me a few laps in practice to realize how freaking fast you can take the first couple of turns here in the SF.
"That is basically dangerous driving by the slower car to be going that slow through that section. If you cant maintain a reasonable speed, get off the track."
"Nice save! 

And a great reminder why you should not be slowing down on an active racetrack. Blue flag is informational, not instructional. Hold your line, facilitate a safe pass; but keep your pace."
Ok but what's under that censored sticker?🤔
Did they go off track and were rejoining or did you notice the relative getting smaller SUPER fast during the whole lap as if they just had poor pace?
I was hoping for 40 seconds of lapping before the incident
I prefer going into replay mode and using my flip phone camera to do clips
needs more star wipe
"Are you European? The evening time slots for EU are far more populated than the US. 

Road Atlanta is a top 5 track for the Super Formula if you ask me. Up there with Spa, Suzuka and Interlagos."
Not always. Had a single split last Saturday 14:30. Night fucking mare.
"Late, late night to very early morning during the week is usually pretty dead for anything above C class."
"most likely. i have mained sf since week one this season, but this is the only week where i havent been doing many sf races. think ive done one for the open and one for fixed, mainly because a.) i dont really like the combo that much with the kerbs pretty much launching you, and b.) my main focus has been getting extra hours in imsa to prep for daytona"
I have only ever been in 1 split SF races. I think its dependent on time zones and EU tends to get multiple splits.
Name of OP
Dick pic sticker
"Not saying that they were, but this is a perfect example of why you should just drive your race and be hyper predictable which means most of the time not just trying to do someone a favor by slowing down/moving over to let them pass."
Slowing down on the racing line for a blind corner is probably not the best place to try and facilitate faster cars passing.
The absolute worst way to let someone pass
"Only time you should slow down is if they are passing you and you want it to complete before a risky corner.  And even then, just lift, don't brake."
Terrible place to do it. He could have went all the way to the right instead. But he stopped right where you need to be to actually take the corner. Ironically he could have caused the death sentence by not driving normally.
Central Europe - usually we get also 2-3 splits
Why is everyone acting like Daytona week is some big mystery?
His name?
Banging doors in practice should be encouraged. Let’s find out where the limits of the cars are! You can practice privately if you want to hotlap.
"50 races first month. Wow... I recently did 300th race, while being close to 4 years on the service :)

Ever since I got to decent IR, I basically said good bye to any race wins. I get some lucky win once or max twice a year. But I made my peace with it and enjoying the hell out of midfield fights. That's where the fun is!"
"I only saw he's 600 after the race in results. I race in VR with just relative box on, it doesn't really say the IR or anything. I didn't even know it was single split until the results"
How can you check the person’s IR who happens to be directly in front of you while mid-race?
"Coming to a full stop in a high speed corner isn't being cautious...

Don't race until you can competently lap the track. Plenty of practice sessions and ghost drives available to learn

Just a racing incident and weird split to have these two drivers in the same race."
Bad day at school buddy?
How can they tweak it if there are only enough participants for 1 split?
"It's insane. Last time I raced here was maybe a year ago on GT3. Remembering how it was pushing outside in T1, my first lap in practice I slowed down to 4th gear. 2nd lap to 5th gear and it was still well within limits. Unbelievable ... I really like how this car cuts through corners here"
"I don't really know if they went off track. I know that on the long straight, the person ahead of me had some 6s clearance, so was focusing on cars behind me. I noticed the yellow car on the start/finish straight, but there was also few cars in pits. So it was very hard to read the pace by glancing at the box"
Personally I was looking forward to another zoomed in shakycam recording from a phone.
Let's not forget at least 5-10 seconds of paused playback before hitting play with the UI still up.
"It's not been my favorite. Kerbs are a bit too tall for the car IMO, plus it really let's it's self shine on wider tracks"
"Yeah, I am in central europe. Usually I do race evenings, but lately I had to shift to early afternoon. Still usually have at least 2-3 splits. I guess it's the Daytona 24 as others mentioned. And agree 100%, Road Atlanta is a blast with SF!"
Ah!
I thought maybe it was a penis picture or something
"Certainly for slower class cars. For same class though, i think you get these much bigger misunderstandings like here where trying to let by while staying on the racing line. 

If green cars pulled to the right after T1 and slowed down they are clearly well off line and out the way. Of course blue flags don’t require you to let anyone through in iRacing, but I think if you choose to, this is the most obvious way to do it safely"
Nailed it!!
I didn't say it was good
op said he was a backmarker
"And it’s a good reminder that slowing down to allow faster traffic by is NOT the move no matter how many people insist on doing it. 

Hold your line, do everything you can to enable a safe pass. But do not slow down! It just makes it worse."
Even outside of Daytona week(s) I am still only getting placed in single split SF races. I think its heavily time zone dependent.
Ya. That’s a possible answer?
"Yeah I'm around 25 races in MX5 since last week. Had nothing to do at work and I'm salaried, so I just let them be my racing sponsor for the week :)

I'll definitely dial back the amount, but I'd be surprised if I did less than 10 races per week between ACC and iRacing"
"I’m at 482 starts and I joined IRacing in 2023 S1W1 😳. 6204 total laps

I didn’t think I raced *that much*, but I guess it’s more than others

EDIT: I can do top-5, but wins are hard for me to come by too

EDIT2: not sure why I’m getting down-voted for simply stating how many starts I have. If you do down-vote, leave a comment as to why. I’d love to learn what has offended ppl / is so wrong with my statement"
"a lot of peopl run overlays, like racelabs, kapps, ioverlay, etc that can show the irating of other people on them"

"Well, having too many series which causes a lot of them to be empty is another thing to check out, let's do one at a time 😁"
"Oh damn yea, those are top shelf"
And then going back and forth and trying to reposition handheld portrait cam filming the screen
"Agreed in the kerbs. The best line here keeps you off all kerbs except the blind one before the esses, out of 7 and the chicane before the hill. Everything else unsettles the car too much."
"I've also always had more fun around Road Atlanta in GTs and Protos, or anything heavier and slower than those. As you said, kerbs are quite harsh, and Formula cars are so twitchy, the number if times I've speared into the left-hand side barriers coming out of the Esses as I take too much kerb, or take the right amount of kerb but catch one of those wicked bumps on the exit and lose the rear. GTs/Protos/etc aren't nearly as twitchy, and IMO are simply better suited for getting the most fun out of this particular circuit."
"Agree. It's fun for hotlapping except for the kerbs, while racing in the SF23 shines on big fat Grand Prix tracks given it's basically an F1.5 car. I hope people realize that when they vote for tracks in the next seasons"
I wish I was excited about the 24. But I find Daytona terribly boring and it’s one my biggest purchase regrets on the service.
"Yup! ""assuming"" they did slow down and go wide to let OP around, they could have just maintained and then been passed after 5. Could also have stayed wide there before 6 and 7 to give them a read for a pass."
The only time it's really acceptable to slow down is to lift slightly when the passing car is already alongside you. But never slow down prior to that moment.
"Getting off line and lifting on a straight is definitely the move if you can, at least in sprint races for open wheelers where the etiquette is to don't cost the leaders any time. If you're in Esses like on Suzuka or Silverstone, just hold your line, yeah."
I've gotten quite a few single split races in the SF23 since around Christmas. Didn't think anything of it during the holidays but I've had a couple more since then. It's kind of annoying but I generally race late at night (CST) so I figure that's the problem there.
I just can't recall definitively if the driver name is in that spot on SF.
"TY ive only used crewchief and troph.ai , i suppose it might be helpful to have an irating overlay for IMSA multiclass. Generally I prefer minimal distractions on my screen thats why I turn off chat. I am driving, not reading."
"And Super Formula is definitely NOT one of those series.

Just timing and track combination. If it weren't the week of the 24hr of Daytona it would probably be a different story."
IMO every season should have Motegi/Suzuka/Fuji since they're actually run every year multiple times
"I feel the same. I haven't purchased it yet but just looking at it is so boring. As I have a Steam account I could test all tracks in test drive and I quit my Daytone test drive after one and a half laps. Right when it was time to get back into the oval after doing 4 proper corners, I was like ""nah not again already, I cba, bye"""
"Sure. There are really no hard and fast rules in racing because the nature of putting cars on the limit is that there can always be some scenario when the prudent thing isn’t actually prudent. 

I’ve certainly lifted many times heading into a corner to allow the overtaking car to make the corner without needing to run very wide or potentially turn in on me. 

The behavior though that I see so often is getting out onto a long straight with a blue flag, and then just moving completely over and lifting. Then moving back and accelerating but by now, there’s a huge delta. And if they’ve misjudged, they might end up with someone behind them with a huge speed difference. I find a LOT of iRacers don’t understand how the “blue flag” works."
Yeah thats when I am typically on as well. The split is so far spread that I am fighting lapped traffice by lap 3 and its frustrating.
It is correct answer :)
Ah as in irscing throws your name there. I do vaguely feel like I’ve seen my own there
Which definitely contributed. I am used to fact that top split usually ends with 2K-ish
This is why I haven't done any SF this week.  It's usually one of my main series. Probably same for many others.
"Didn't say the contrary, participation would improve though"
"The community manager has sth similar in place where I think at least 2 Japanese tracks are run every season. I think they don't do 3 because Okayama isn't really great in the car and Motegi isn't really popular to be in there so often, so two a season should be fine.

I'd personally run Suzuka as a crown jewel every single season, as it's amazing to drive and the most iconic Japanese track anyway."
"I got on last night and really considered jumping in because i LOVE Road Atl (""home"" circuit) but then noticed it was rarely going more than 1 split and thought, ""thats gonna be a bloodbath"". Lol"
"That's like saying enrollment for underwater basket weaving would increase if we got rid of engineering courses...

Yeah, sure, participation might go up. But people would probably go elsewhere too."
I raced Proto-GT there last night and was one of 7 GT cars in a 1 split 34 car field. I've had better times on Iracing.
I’d enroll in an underwater basket weaving course
"Oooffffff. 

Maybe ill give it a go tonight lol"
Best of luck lol
Just Electron things...
I agree. Seems like that would be a pretty simple update.
"Use windowgrid my man:

http://windowgrid.net/"
I am not super familiar with how Electron works. But Discord and Spotify are Electron based and they both snap without issue.
"Apparently it's a Windows bug where if you ever make your application non-resizable, it removes it from being snappable."
Or iRacing could use technology that conforms to the standard windows manager.
"Oh yeah I totally agree but if it bothers op so much, there is a solution they can use. Plus just wanted to mention it cause it's an incredibly useful tool for the ultrawide crowd out there."
"Thanx for the responses guys! We've tried some things and will see how far we get this time.

"Are you streaming? I've had this just few days ago when I opened up obs to try streaming (never streamed before), I just gave up because putting too much on my cpu (3700x, 3070, triple 1440p)."
Turn on XMP
"Is that the one using your powerlines to transmit the signal? If yes and you can hardwire to your pc, than defo better than WiFi, which is a NoNo for any type of gaming where latency is vital"
"If it works in your home a powerline adapter could give a much lower latency connection than WiFi but they have their own issues.

Not every property has compatible wiring and they can be subject to interference from large appliances like washer/dryers, vacuums, air conditioners etc which cause noise.

You may get lower speeds than over WiFi depending your home circuitry layout and which WiFi standard you’re using, interference, range etc.

Powerlines can also suffer from bufferbloat when there’s very high packet count which may make your latency way, way worse than WiFi, so it depends what else is running and the game traffic pattern and what else is running.

You’re better off with moca or running Ethernet if possible, or possibly upgrade your existing WiFi."
Use ethernet dude
"I have had Ethernet over powerline for the last two months and I have had no blinking issues (myself, anyways: 3 namers will always blink)"
I use a powerline adapter and it hasn’t had any ill effects on my connection. Instructions say you can only use outlets on the same breaker but they doesn’t seem to be the case. Modem is in the living room; rig is downstairs.
If you have coax you can use MOCA. I had room where Ethernet wasn’t feasible and it worked out well.
I’ve been using a Power-line adapter for years.Works better for me than WiFi.Just make sure you don’t cross different circuits as it affects performance.
I haven’t tried powerline yet just WiFi .
Do u think powerline hardwire to the router would creat a better connection
Cant
Why not?
I had the same issue. If you have to run a Ethernet cable over 3 Stories it 1) create a lot of tension with people you live with and 2) it is sometimes simply not practical. I run my sim PC over powerlines it works fine. Latency is ok. If my wife starts the tumbler im in trouble but other than that it works.
Thank you honestly most of the time when I’m blinking it’s a GeForce update I didn’t install but I know I’ve had connection issues in the past to . The power line definitely seems better though
"Close all trading paint applications and website, delete file in folder. Then upload new items in TP"
"Did you remove the paint via the website? If not, it'll keep on downloading the suit regardless of what you do with the local files on your PC"
"I did do that I believe but I’ll try again later today 

I ended up messaging customer service may be glitch or something"
Yes the website too I deleted the whole suit from the builder
"You have to close the app, then right click on status bar and close it again as it runs in the background. You know if you’ve done it"
Even left not running for the day the trading paint downloader
Yup did that even uninstalled it and reinstalled it as well

When I don’t have TP on the suit doesn’t load so it must be a glitch I believe

Suit still comes up on the website even tho file is deleted on website and computer

I was just messing around with the builder learning it then deleted it after I did everything playing with the different size png files I have no issues with anything else but the suit switching them

Just to show what what I mean"
"For **iRacing** (which is the only relevant rulebook in regards to iRacing) it is legal to go below the yellow on the straights on ovals (including tri/quadovals). Caveat is it is 100% the responsibility of the person using the apron to rejoin safely, and nobody is obligated to make room. If a wreck ensues, the person rejoining from the apron can be protested as an unsafe rejoin."
It's perfectly legal on the straights and the tri-oval. I would be protesting the blocking though.
[Daytona Rules explained by staff](https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/comment/95483/#Comment_95483)
Yup. I don't believe IMSA has a double yellow rule. And i'm fairly certain Iracing has no double yellow rule implemented in any series.
"Road, yes
Oval, technically no but everyone does it anyway"
I think it's a gentleman's agreement not to.
"I'm confused on why blocking is illegal ( or is it? )
That is literally racing.
 If you are not allowed to block then with how drafting works this game would just be a passing exercise.
They block / defend in all forms of racing. From karts to F1 and everything in between.
I watch multiple forms of racing and I've heard multiple times "" he will have to drive with his elbows out "" specifically stating the driver will have to actively block to maintain thier position."
It depends in that case you forced him down there . So it’s allowed at least in nascar it is . I would assume the rules align for imsa
"I would love to see one of your races.
To see if you just move out of the way of everyone that reels you in."
I’ve protested somebody forcing a rejoin before that wrecked me and had the protest denied. I will admit I was holding them down there but I didn’t go below the line.
"> For iRacing


FWIW, it's legal in IMSA too."
"The aprons in the banked corners however have slowdowns and are considered not race track. The latest patch added cones to clearly delineate where the ""on track apron"" and ""off track apron"" starts and stops. "
Legal in oval in iracing too
"Every time Daytona comes up this question gets asked and without fail there's always someone confidently stating incorrect information.


You can pass under the apron on the tri-oval but you have to rejoin safely. Other cars are under no obligation to let you back above the apron if you go down. "
"The difference between blocking and defending is more to do with the intent, if you make the defensive move before any attempt is made it is legal, if you make a last second reaction move before a corner to get in front of someone to stop them going past its blocking and illegal as braking lines etc are already dry made and this can lead to incidents"
"No need to be confused...read the sporting code. Blocking is defined there, and what constitutes being entitled to space. Oval racing and road racing have different rules on what this is. For an example, a textbook illegal road block would be for you to be looking to pass inside, and the defender swerves in front of you after you've begun breaking/turning. That's illegal. Repeatedly changing lines to cut off a run, illegal. This can and has led to penalties in many of the series it sounds like you watch. There is definitely nuance, and announcers words are not a good source of truth when discussing technical terms. Look at how often the word ""tarmac"" is used in place of ""apron"" in news stories involving an airport. "
Wouldn't be much fun if blocking was legal. If the car ahead can simply watch their mirrors and react to the car behind then you'd never be able to overtake.  If you've ever raced against someone that physically stops you from getting the overlap then you know how dangerous and unfun it is to race against.
"What video did you watch? How can a car behind ""force a car down there""?"
why would I move out of the way?
"It's surprising to me how often people get this wrong.

I've heard so many ""rules"" including ""you can only do it on the last lap"" and ""you can only do it in the last 3 laps"" like where did people come up with this stuff?"
"I can see what your saying.
But I think that it would have to be a very last second swerve which was clearly a dangerous attempt to invade a clear lane to stop the pass."
"I'm not saying that if a driver begins to attempt to pass that the defender should be able to swerve in front of the passer unsafely. Especially when the pass has begun.
But if the passer is behind and closing the gap to be able to pass.
The defender should be allowed to close than lane, by positioning the car in front of the lane which would allow the pass, to include moving down or up if the passer looks for another open lane. And this shouldn't be limited to certain amount of times.
The passer needs to out perform/drive the driver in front of they want the position.
Normally when a defender is actively trying to defend a position they will make a mistake (in due time ) that a passer can capitalize on to pass safely.
Defending a position is difficult for an extended amount of time.
You shouldn't just give your position away.
I guess I'm not understanding why you would just move out of the way every time."
"A car lapping you isn't the same as you giving up position.
To different scenarios.
A lapping car should be given a clear lane to pass you.
Not someone wanting to take your position."
"https://m.facebook.com/NASCAR/videos/what-a-block-kyle-busch/10154971026943801/

This is common practice in racing."
Green car was blocked twice as he almost hit the apron blocking him dude should have just dumped him and been done
By seeing people doing and trying to figure out how it works on their own
"Block is basically reacting to a move, distance (unless MILES APART) doesn’t really take away the context, just different severities aka cars nearly beside verse a cars worth of gap behind, ones seen as dangerous and the other is seen as arsehole-ish / stupid"
"You're misunderstanding what I'm saying, and if we were looking at some examples I bet we would mostly agree on the legality.  Weaving to cut off a run is defined better in the sporting code than I can do it, and absolutely can lead to a penalty in many real life series. But for iRacing, just go read the rules if you want clarification on what's not allowed in-game"
You're not allowed to block anyone regardless of what lap they're on.
"What would you call this then.

https://m.facebook.com/NASCAR/videos/what-a-block-kyle-busch/10154971026943801/

This is clearly moving up and down on the track to block a position change.

Maybe that's my issue, that it's an iRacing rule.
But if that is the case, and I'm not just understanding it.
It still would not make sense to just give up position.

I very rarely "" block "" ( I'd call it defending ), I'd rather move too allow a car that is clearly faster than me pass than get wrecked or get incident points.
I will try and keep my position when the car behind me is keeping pace and it's only able to pass due to drafting or mistakes that I make.
I see no issue with that.
I neither get upset when I'm trying to take position, and the defender does the same.
I just see it as racing. I actually think it's more fun. If it's not a challenge then what's the point."
"That clip looks perfectly clean to me. I honestly think we do agree, I'm just not articulating the difference in what I'm picturing in my head very well. If I wasn't in the middle of spotting my team for the 24, I'd pull a clip showing what I'm talking about. "
"That's cool, your doing a 24 hour race.
I've wondered what it would be like to do one of those.
Must be fun."
"Oh, man it's so much fun. We are somewhat new to endurance races (have maybe done 6), and fumbling around of the logistics, goofing around in VC, the collective insanity that develops over that many hours provide a ton of entertainment."
The 1987s have a similar length with fixed setup.
"I'm loving xfinity class B! Yesterday I had my first open race and it was about 1 hour race with 3 pit stops. Very funny!

Now I need to learn to make oval setups lol. They are veeeery different to road setup making"
"You can find free setups for open on garage61.

Those and the fixed setups are probably good enough if your irating is not too high.


You also can do fixed longer races in the winter nascar series which last around 2 hours.[2h15m for my race in it this week]"
"Wait until the NASCAR season starts. I love racing the B-class Cup Series races. There's a fixed setup and it's even a little longer than Gen-4, so two pitstops usually."
"As other says, Nascar Legends (87 NASCAR on B licence). If you buy car right now you will take a part in few races of Nascar Winter Series, this series have races around two hours. But only three tracks left. And this series will close until next winter. Because series is filler for Nascar iRacing Series.

Nascar iRacing Series have 5 open setups and 5 fixed setups, following real nascar schedule and have 50% of real life race duration. You need Nascar Cup Car for this.

Some races have 100% distance, like Daytona 500, Coke 600, Bristol ect. So you will race around 4h."
"I've been doing nothing but Gen 4 series this week to get my safety rating & iRating back to normal after taking a beating in Draft Masters recently. I think I'm a few more races from moving to B license on Oval. My safety rating is barely under 4 despite being under 3 last week.


The Gen 4 series is perfect at 50 laps with cautions. I suppose the series will teach drivers to be more patient and not try to win on the first lap. Most of my races this week have been chaos free for the most part. Talladega and Daytona are always going to have huge wrecks. Sometimes it's better to hang towards the back until about 10 to go. There's not a lot of pit strategy, besides taking fuel & tires once."
"Thank you I'll go check it out, are the cars similar as well?"
"It always feels demotivating to me to drive with a lesser setup than the competition, that's why I prefer fixed setup."
"Driving standards seem to be better in gen 4 compared to Arca/draftmaster/streetstock, it makes the racing a lot more enjoyable."
"The 87s are like driving a boat: very heavy car, very small tires. Emphasizes tire saving and being smooth on the throttle and brakes. My favorite oval car."
"Haven’t driven them a whole lot recently, but I believe they tend to slide around a lot in the corners."
"No, they're a lot different IMO. 1987's are like driving a block of ice, but they're fun regardless... and fast."
87’s are a handful. But so damn fun
"You can always pay for vrs if its important enough for you.


Otherwise sticking to the special nascar races and gen 4 is also worth it"
"I agree. Don't get me wrong, I've made mistakes in those series but it's win on the first lap mentality with many drivers until you move up to a series with cautions & pit strategy. I wish Gen 4 series would start out with a reduced fuel capacity to force at least 2 fuel stops in the 50 lap race. But I'm sure other series in A & B are longer and more realistic once I progress up the ladder."
"The gen4 already feels like a boat compared to road cars, not sure if it will be my cup of tea haha."
Here's [a video from a race at Legacy Michigan this week](https://youtu.be/bYIR26scCsU?si=zL-7_puC2Iczpmwq) to give you an idea
"I subscribe to Nick's YouTube channel. I watched some of his Michigan video yesterday. Basically he saved tires, stayed consistent and won. Btw, I hate Michigan. It's like driving on a 6 lane highway but with only one lane that's smooth."
Damn and here I spend hours practicing and barely manage to get a faster lap than you. I’m actually complete garbage
"[This](https://a.co/d/9ZzSzdZ) is a nifty little bit of kit for using load cell pedals with a rolling chair. Just in case that’s helpful.

Congrats!! Sounds like you’ve got some talent, you know what you’re doing and you’re headed in the right direction! Keep at it, and enjoy!"
Nice! You were definitely quicker then me.
A sense of pride and accomplishment.
"A certificate that you can download as a PDF, print out, and frame it."
Like 20 irating
Winning in top split I believe grants entry into world championships and such I think I read. But it’s glory and pride
Same thing you get for any other race.
Hmm I thought that would be more generous idk like 10iracing credits or something but I guess that it
"You are correct. (Top split only )

"Edit: See reply, I’m wrong

You don’t get into the World Championship series by winning Special Events. Each WC series has its own qualifying series where the top drivers in the standings at the end of the season get to enter the WC."
What are other ways to get into the esports champs ? Clearly not only winning a top split would be enough cars .. maybe?
Whatever VCO puts on. I saw something about it in passing so won’t further the foot in thy mouth
"Yes you do now. (Top split only)

https://x.com/vcoesports/status/1748092892617318700?s=46&t=YPTS00QloP-7cu-2pk6RNg"
For IMSA. It was invite only last year. All the other esports series are via a qualifying series
"Wow, missed that announcement. Thank you."
Ahhh iracing Reddit. Actually be informed and be downvoted to hell for it lol.
"Reddit post 2 years ago:

Hi! press ctrl+alt+del, open the task manager, go to the tab ""services"" and search ""iracingservice"". Right click on it and stop it. Try again the update, and once it finishes, restart the iracingservice (right click on it and ""start"" or ""restart"")."
thanks for the quick help (:
"Usually when its a disconnect the wheel goes 100% to the left instantly, which didnt happen here. This looks more like someone either fell asleep at the wheel or had a sudden emergency to jump out of the rig for. The way the wheel jerks when he hits the wall tells me there might not be anyone holding the wheel anymore."
"Could still be computer hardware related. I crashed in the LM 24h once where my screen froze entirely, my inputs still worked, and I didn't wind up disconnecting until several seconds later."
Code brown.

"What’s with the red, white, and blue, and different signage? Is this setup for Daytona 24 or am I just blind when driving?"
Maybe hardware issue with his wheel
Do a kickflip!!
"Could have been on vr and had the headset freeze. Happened to me a few times, headset freezes but rest of your inputs are still working."
"Im more impressed by your graphics, they look fantastic compared to mine lol"
Report it either way. Racing with inconsistent hardware that causes accidents is no less ok than intentional wrecking.
"Odd, he downshifts while it trails of like that."
Having small kids i guess xD i can imagine a kid out of curiosity “hey what this does?” As he presses the downshift pad :D or he could have fallen asleep and reacted when hitting the wall.
I was racing with vr when due to something it lost my position and I was racing looking the pedals. Ofc I went in a wall very fast.
Hardware issue for sure
"Hi was downshifting during the crash, and also immediately disconnected from session, or he was DQ?"
"The timing is the only thing that initially made me think he tried to hit me. Then I watched the video, and I agree. Hopefully not a medical emergency or something and just sleepy or had to leave abruptly like you said. 

Was a tough one haha."
"Not always. Different wheels react differently. Some hold position, or go to center.


That said, the fact that it reacted to hitting the wall would still be odd for a disconnect."
"I don't necessarily suspect malice, but what do you make of the three downshifts?"
But they downshifted practically mid air
"It’s weird though because they are downshifting before hitting the wall and during the flip. I’m guessing some mix of disconnect or server lag?

At first I thought maybe driver zoned out and muscle memory of oval racing kicked in until last second, but the driver cam shows otherwise with the very slow turn in back to the race line so far back."
I also love how if you scrub the video. He carries my wing until the bitter end. Logitech starting directly back at him. lol
Glad I’m not the only one that noticed that
Are you trolling?
"Meh, that goes against the spirit of motor racing and the mechanical failure being apart of it. I would be a huge fan if iRacing implemented a .5% chance of mechanical breakage to your car each race, stuck throttle or brake failure.

https://youtu.be/k67vcMGF4-M?si=SYbmk7aWOINlzCWH"
"How do you know his hardware is inconsistent?


This is definitely not something to protest."
"Saw that, too. I'm guessing auto-shift"
"yea if he was aiming for you, i doubt he would have slowly drifted into the wall first."
My thought was fully automatic which seems not likely lol.
"To me it sort of looks like they realized they were drifting away or falling asleep and tried to get it back but were too late. It looked like the wheel got yanked before they hit the wall so that mightve been when they came back, then they just sorta gave up once they realized they were 15 feet in the air driving towards the moon"
Do you not recognize Charlotte orrrrrrr
I am not
"Sega GT 2002 for the original Xbox has that I think.

They had a whole system built around maintenance and damage, if you didn’t maintain the car between races or got short on funds, the car would have a chance of breaking down. Probably one of my favorite racing games."
If they could do that in a way that it won't affect your ratings I'm all for it
"Looking back, I don't think it's mechanical. This person just got up and left, which I still find unacceptable and unsportsmanlike, so I still think a protest should go on their record. Medical emergency, perhaps, but he was disqualified after contact. You can tell because they blip out while still moving. It could also be a bad connection, though, too. Either way, you can't just let your car go mid race that's not acceptable."
"Exactly right, just hard to tell until you get a chance to watch it back, so many incidents where my initial assumption of what happened is entirely wrong. 

Anywho, onto the next!"
"I don’t believe in official c class races you can do this? 

Also, I’m leaning towards it being a wheel base issue, where the base stopped reacting to rotation but the wheel buttons still worked"
Oh.  I do now 🤣🤣🤣
"Ohhh snap, okay. Just assumed that was the Daytona bus stop. lol. Thanks…I don’t really drive Charlotte"
It's Charlotte not Daytona
I did protest this and the protest went in my favour. Downvotes be damned.
"Yeah, just saw a comment. My bad. I never race Charlotte and this just looked 100% identical to the Daytona bus stop. I totally missed Charlotte written down the wall as thanks."
"Haha, I had zero doubts that it would be successful. I couldn't care less about the downvotes. It's glaringly obvious: 90%, this sub is clueless."
"Definitely, came back to give you a small amount of satisfaction haha. See you on the track."
"You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. Thanks haha."
"My best bet on the bus stop is to follow others through it. It doesn't matter if my bus stop is not as good as my fastest attempts, the draft afterwards will always make sure I can attempt an overtake in T1.

When I do not have anyone in front of me, I always fuck up much quicker lol"
"“If you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are an iRacer”

Two wide = suicide.
"Please GTP racers, 2 rules to remember while passing GT3s.


1. Et the bus stop, either go for it so we can loft early and slot in behind you or stay behind. Dont just put your nose in the first apex forcing the GT3s to leave space and slow down extremely. This will cause a crash.


2. Be EXTREMELY careful (or dont do it) whne passing more than one GT3 car in a braking zone. Remember that the car in front has its view blocked by the car behind and they risk not seeing you coming. This can cause a crash.


Thank you for your understanding "
Tbh I was expecting WAY worse than just that little slowdown penalty lmao
Laurens Vanthoor does not approve this post
I was really hoping for a clip of someone sending it in to the bus stop :c
*Licks Stamp*
"![gif](giphy|RfAuCCsCMVJLgPX88v)

Send it into the bus stop!"
"I've had so many GTP's divebomb from waay back to pass into the bus stop yesterday, it's infruriating.

Like as I'm about to turn in, the appear.

Stop trying to be heroes GTP drivers."
"You were just lucky the 2 cars in front missed the corner and lost big time on exit. If they made it through there at the usual pace, you would have lost even more time bc you lifted early. So it depends if you should send it or not. I have made successful passes like you did in the clip, I have made passes sending it and I have been side by side with a GTP through the whole bus stop without crashing (didn't get the overtake done immediately though). All this week.

Nice overtake but sometimes you gotta send it and sometimes you gotta be patient and let it come to you. It's not black and white like your caption tries to make it look like. Racecraft is a beautiful thing"
\>cuts instead
"Could show this to me team-mates, but sadly they are too big of hotheads"
"Do you guys smell that? Mmm, chicken :)"
I'm so bad at the bus stop. Very inconsistent without hitting an off track. Usually anyone behind me flies up on me if they are somewhat close.
"Pffft, as the faster racer in the faster car, you can ALWAYS send it to the bus stop if you just aggressively flash your lights for the full straight.

/s"
"It's like 2 wide up eu Rouge.  Too many people see it done irl, so they think they have a chance."
That quote is the bane of my existence. I wish he'd come back from the grave just to retract it. The average SR on iracing would literally jump a whole level.
"That quote was from an interview with Jackie Stewart who immediately told Senna ""Grow up"".

It was a response to a question about him hitting Prost and taking him out of a race (which he later admitted was intentional).

100% Senna2 iRacer smashin' P1 into T1 and daring anyone to get close enough to crash. 

He did get fined by the FIA (fine was never paid) and retract statements (about the FIA refusing to change course when one of their penalties was shown with video evidence to be wrong), but that's not this quote."
"If you go for a gap that doesn't really exist for your skill level, you are an iRacer."
"""You have to leave a space! ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE TO LEAVE A DA SPACE!""

The name killed me! Lol
I’ve done it and lived but I only did it because the car in front was going sooooo slow that it was easier than it sounds to get past
"Hesitation is a big problem with GTP and GT3. The GTP gets super close, goes to the inside, then doesn't pass."
Use side mirrors. Too many people leave them off.
"I think this sub is more adverse to actual racing than the usual player. I'm very patient in my racecraft, but being always patient only works to a certain point. After a certain level, you'll be racing with people with a lot of car control and pace, so you have to be comfortable with being aggressive attacking and defending, and aggressiveness is a part of racing.

Hoping the other guy crashes at some point of the race stops working really fast."
"Agree they lost a bit more time than what they could've done, and agree this sub takes more cautious approach to close racing.

But I assert that you do not send it into bus stop. Categorical. Small divergence from the racing line will cause you both to lose a lot of time -- and I'll say no two drivers can manage to get through there with any overlap without actually choreographing it -- and if you were in a position to send it to begin with, the better option is to draft in the upcoming straight, and do the move in T1 where overtaking maneuvers are actually feasibly doable without wrecking anyone or losing a lot of time.

Sometimes you need to send it. Not here. Never."
I mean in many cars it's not really hard to do that. I don't think I've ever got into a crash getting passed or passing in Eau Rouge. Not really the same as the super tight bus stop
"He did retract it. Publicly.

But nobody reads retractions."
I mean the origin of the quote is literally a weak cover/excuse for taking out another driver. 
"Allegedly,  he did eventually apologize for it. But I never looked it up, so I'm not sure."
"*single monitor has entered the chat
*low spec pc has entered the chat"
"Honestly, as someone with a high iRating, even in a 6k SOF race I wouldn't have sent it in OP's position in that video. But otherwise I agree with you. A high iRating driver would have likely stayed behind too (though I can think of a few who could have sent it and made it work, but myself at 5k I wouldn't have), but much closer and without losing so much time, setting himself up for a pass into T1.

However I totally agree about the fact that many people in this subreddit are very afraid of racing."
"Haha, yeah and then you get to a point where “hoping the other makes a single mistake” stops working and every tenth gained or lost through a corner matters."
"Couldn’t agree more. This sub lately seems like they’re more focused on playing iSteward and protesting every small contact as opposed to learning how to race. Thankfully I think it’s a vocal minority.

Hell of a move by OP though to be patient and be in position to strike when the opportunity presented itself."
You have a far better benefit and percentage from a slight coast then hard throttle exit to over take on the straight or even jockey for a fight into the chicane.
"3 main reasons.  I don't trust myself. I don't trust the other driver. I don't trust the net code. 

I'd rather fake a move to get them off line and have a go on the straight or the big brake zone coming up."
Really?
And very few people today realize that and just take the quote literally
Not always. That's only true if it's only 2 cars battling. It's not always that simple. Sometimes getting the pass done there is better for you situation.
"Yup. He crashed Alain Prost out of the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix to take the title, and the ""if gap"" quote was his excuse after the fact. He admitted about a year later to Jackie Stewart (who'd initially interviewed him after the race) that he was just making an excuse for a pre-planned decision not to yield if Prost overtook him. That being said, I'm not sure how ""public"" you'd call that, and you have to do a bit of digging to find it, so I'm not entirely surprised the ""retraction"" isn't more commonly known.

The prevalence of that quote remains one of the most frustrating and stupid things to hear in the F1/simracing community though. It was bullshit the moment it came out of his mouth."
"Yes. The other poster did a pretty good job explaining.

Also, it was obvious bullshit when he said it. He just wasn't dumb enough to admit to intentionally wrecking to guarantee a championship win. He needed to say something so he went with that. Nobody bought it. The fact people repeat it now like it was legit is cringeworthy."
"He could say whatever he wanted given the amount of bullshit he had to face from the officials. P1 was supposed to be on the clean side of the track for the race. Once he'd secured pole, it was suddenly on the dirty side. He knew from previous races at the circuit that he was never getting to turn 1 first and he'd been fucked over by the officials. Crashing was the right thing for him to do in that situation, although I'm surprised he managed to even get into the car with balls that big."
"Well most of them repeating it do live in fantasy land where it doesn't hold any weight. You don't see any IRL guys racing like that, if they do its not for long."
"Doesn't seem like obv bullshit in the interview, seems like a mad guy saying anything to get a living legend off his back. Jackie was pissed that someone would spit in the face of the safety he worked so hard to bring, and aryton just got mad right back at him"
"Pole in Japan was never on the clean side of the track until 1991 after Senna’s complaints. It was always on the dirty side of the track there to give the driver the inside line which was initially considered the more desirable position. Senna requested it to be changed, and it didn’t until the following year."
"Have you run all the steps posted in the VR forum stickied post ""VR optimization guide""?"
"Don't mention the hmd or anything...

Keep dropping. You want 90hz at the sacrifice of res. A lot of vr tuning tips on iracing forum
Specific threads etc.

3080ti is bare min for full q3, g2 res with in game settings reduced accordingly."
That's vr. Get ready to do lots of tinkering everytime there's an update
Have you dropped your graphics settings all the way down?
what headset are you using and what mode are you running iRacing in
"Brotherman, you almost have the same setup as me. Mine is smooth so play around with it"
It could be poor head tracking. Check the head tracking in another app.
"Your usb port speed is probably too low. Had the same, after plugging it in a 3.0 port and updating the chipset drivers it was good."
"I run 85% resolution, 4x MSAA and FFoV rendering on G2 on a 3070ti. Still look super sharp though."
"So I have tried moving the main graphic setting slider to max framerate and it does seem much better. I had assumed it wasnt a framerate issue but I was wrong. The display in the top right corner was pretty stable at 90, and the indicator bars were barely showing any load."
Nah. If you set it up right the first time it's fine.  Haven't changed my settings in over a year and that's only because I changed HMDs
"And I run 70% on a 3060Ti. With my 5600x it sometimes struggled with things like night Daytona. 

5800x3d has been solid.  Just magical to have such smooth sailing "
Try turning up particles.
Graphic settings. Even my potato pc shows them
It could be an old track guide. I don’t recall their being a gravel trap on the left after 130R
"I think he likely means the lighter color on the right side of the track. It’s hard to see from the recording you are showing but it can be some light dusting of dirt on the track, or maybe just shadows? I believe that is what he is referring to"
On a side note it's not great to use track markings as braking points because they can get obscured by skid marks or they may not be visible at night.
"https://preview.redd.it/tmeksxfo6pdc1.jpeg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=847a79422fe8198ec4a81a30f6be6894e5e8eba8

This is my setting"
do you know which setting?
"Yes, I know what he refers to, it is so obvious in his video, but I can’t see them in my game, is it because my graphic setup?"
"Will probably be something related to road texture or similar. If you hover your mouse over it, an explanation pops up bottom of the screen. Applies to a lot of iR stuff"
"We call that a netcode incident. Internet racing isn’t instantaneous, so the game has to predict where everything will be a few fractions of a second ahead of time. Sometimes, that prediction from the server doesn’t match up with what actually happens and what you see. Most of the time it works, but sometimes bad connections can make things look very weird.

Here, the servers thought contact would happen, and sent the data of the contact before you saw the cars come together."
"This is the 'ole netcode thingamajigger! Fuuun stuff, hopefully that was the end of the race... oops, just noticed the 'towing' time limit... backspace would be too hard, so I'll chug forward."
![gif](giphy|uef61htFeLZRK)
Net code horrendous
Sucks. Our session was in the 1st time slot. No issues on our end.
Thanks for the reply looks as though nobody else had this issue. So weird and ruined our race still manged P16 but had the pole and were running 2nd when first comp crash happend
"I wouldn't use it but I really don't see any problems with an option like this. A ""hide ratings"" toggle in the UI doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to do. Irating is already hidden for rookies so it's something that can certainly be done. Yeah, why not."
You can always download an overlay and hide the iratings there.
"I was thinking about a similar idea. Instead of having an irating shown every race, only reveal the iRating at the end of the season. That way people can just race and not worry about it for a bit."
"I wish they would replace with something useful 

1) Championships points/division/position for a series I pick. 

2) Avg finishing position comparison ""last season/current season""

3) Incidents per race trend "
"I'm in vr, is ir shown on a normal screen?"
"Yeah I'm sure this would be a nice feature for a bunch of people. Unlike SR, you don't really need to know your iR, one ""number go up"" game is enough for some. 


Personally, I don't think I'd be able to resist my curiosity, but my iRating is at a number that I can at least call myself ""average"" and not feel terrible about myself as a result. "
"I'm not really fussed by seeing irating.

I wish cars were numbered in the official servers by drivers preferred number, then randomly after that."
I think this is a good option to have. I wouldn't use it but others have suggested it. Put it in the feature suggestion forum.
You can hide iRating and license level in the UI. Go to setting->interface->hide irating balance in header. Is that what you are looking for?
It’s more about what’s visible in the general UI. I realized I’m not doing myself any favors though by showing it in the standings page of my dash. Gonna pull it out from there.
"Yeah, exactly that, at least for me. I find myself looking at my relative practice pace in the context of iR, especially when I’m considering racing outside my main series. I worry about my iR suffering and ending up in more chaotic splits. Skill does seem to correlate reasonably well with iR, but I was obviously able to deal with it before I got into higher splits."
Many competitive games abstract the number into tiers instead so people don't get hung up on the minor changes. 
"You gave me another idea to walk the walk. I designed my dash to show iR, because it’s a helpful proxy for driving ability. I could probably replace that with a non-specific indicator or two based on the combo of license, SR, and iR. Same utility without me being able to put it in the context of iR relative to me."
"I was referring to what I see in the main launcher both in general and after a race. Once I’m in a session, I already don’t have to see it anywhere. I designed my custom dash to show me others’ iR, which is helpful as a proxy for driving ability, but I could easily hide my own (e.g., in the standings)."
"I like to just use their number in the session. I know that the #1 guy is likely going to be fast and #30 slow. You get no info on irating, but essentially the same info without having the actual number rattling in your head. "
"Oh, yeah, it is what it is. If it drops, you'll win more of it rises, you'll lose more."
"I don’t think that works for practice sessions though, does it? I ended up creating an iR gauge for my immediate relative, so I also know if the cars immediately ahead and behind have incredibly high or low iR, which is particularly useful for practice or single splits with massive iR spread."
"Yep. For crazies like me though, big drops are feared more than they probably should be. At least I stopped short of adding predicted iR change to my dash."
"Yeah, I don't think that would work in practice"
I feel this. This is why I hate ranked games but iRacing is the one “ranked” game I’ll actually play
"Yeah I onky play ranked. Find the best competition there, Do I care, nope, they're video games lol."
"One of my proudest simracing moments was during the Spa 24. I got in the car with 99x, two hours later I handed it off to my teammate with 99x."
"I recall my last 10h of Road Atlanta, got the car with 47/50 for a penalty, did a two hour stint (more like 1h 40min, LMP2 is a bit wired with how long it runs), delivered the car for the last driver with 48/50, the last driver had to pay a drive through after he completed the first lap as he gets two off tracks on the out lap."
"Nice work, especially considering inc points come easy at Pouhon in Spa. You’re a good teammate, and I’m certain your ability to avoid incident points is highly valued the same as your laptimes 😁"
At Spa and that is very impressive
"Luckily drivethroughs at Sebring are a minor issue

At Spa endurance, it's almost 80 seconds lost lol"
"That's the part they're not telling us.

It would have been faster to collect the incidents and serve the DT as they were 3s/lap off pace :p"
"Yeah without even bringing calculations into this, my teammates that get the inc points are quite fast, and I’m sure that’s related to why they’re getting them. So they’re doing more good than harm. Sure I get way fewer inc points but I’m not as fast."
"It's always good to have a safe driver we can throw in when we need to be conservative. You're just as much of an asset as those that are faster, I assure you 👍"
Thanks for that!
"Who knows. Probably to do with licensing. 


Some think that we might get the gt3 this year with it coming to imsa but who knows"
"None of us (likely) have any inside information to answer these questions, yet people always ask. The best answer? Maybe #soon, maybe never, who knows. It’s not like iRacing just scans whatever cars they want, there’s a lot of cooperation involved from many parties.

Also the current McLaren GT4 is the Artura."
"It's not in GT4 because the 720S isn't in GT4 IRL. 

It's not in GT3 because iracing hasn't scanned it. This will hopefully be remedied shortly now that Pfaff is running a 720S. They let iracing scan their 992 GT3 R and (I believe) their McLaren 570S GT4."
I didn’t ask when. I asked why. Clearly there is some beef between McLaren and iRacing for them to not work this out by now. Someone must have some inside info. What’s the beef. Mclaren got some kind of deal with the devs of ACC that excludes them from other titles?
Would you sleep better at night knowing?
"Wait, iRacing doesn't work directly with the manufacter for the data? Or the scan?"
"Absolutely, wouldn’t you? 

No truthfully it doesn’t really bother me at all I’m just interested in the details of how the licensing works and why McLaren wouldn’t be keen to get their current GT car into a game as popular as iracing."
"I'm sure they're involved but it seems like there also needs to be a racing team that allows their car to be scanned. 

It's case by case though. BMW worked closely with iracing and got the m4 gt3 into iracing before it even hit the track. McLaren as a manufacturer doesn't seem that interested though."
"There's a myriad of factors from as simple as McLaren wanting too high of a licence cost for it to make sense for iRacing to other cars being higher priority to build.   

Like most of the missing IMSA cars are ran by only a couple teams and/or are fairly ""long in the tooth"" and should be due for another ""Evo"" version.   And the cars not used by many teams leaves iRacing vulnerable to it being obsolete if the teams move on from the car.  "
"Strange, I really thought iRacing worked directly with the manufacters/enginners like ACC. And I dont think it would be a problem with GT World Challenge because DTM and Imsa exists. Probably is way cheaper for them to work with a team than a manufacter, thats prob one area ACC has it easy because of their relationship with GT World Challenge."
"I bought iRacing over the new Year and it is fantastic.

I love the competion and the scheudeled Race, iRacing Rating and Safety Rating System.

But it is hard to earn Safety rating when u get crashed every second Race.

&#x200B;

When I finish as second with 2 Incidents I get a Safety Rating of + 0.05

I was spun out 2times, rammed couple times spinning/crashing cars, got rearended couple times, still managed to get 5th

and I get a Safety Rating of - 0.17 

In my case I drive the MX-5 Series, the GR86 Weekend Series was much better but they changed the Track, and I don´t want to buy a Track I will never drive again.

&#x200B;

I bought a GT3 car and all Layouts for the Nürburgring, that is my Goal, driving the GT3 Series

on the Nordschleife or other Tracks.

&#x200B;

But it is very frustrating, I can´t reach the points to jump to next class, I have to wait till saison will end."
"Get out of rookies. Fuck your iRating until you can get into a series that isn’t MX5 rookies and focus on SR. Drive your own race, avoid other cars the entire time"
"Im in class D now, I get promoted to C, but Im trying hard to gain the points needed for

the fast promotion.

Overall 50 Races so far and I love to Race...

I will try it, is it the best way to skip quali then and just overtake spinning cars?

I dont care about the iRating, I was just trying to drive save as possible and have a good race and finish.

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT: After 1 Race without incidents, took  9th place, Safety Rating + 0.02"
"SR isn't just calculated by the race you just ran either, you could do that same race again, with 0x again and gain a different amount of SR. Just keep racing clean and it will improve over time. If you focus to much on just the numbers then are you really enjoying the racing?"
"Gf: ""Come to bed, you can do 5 laps of iRacing but then we should really sleep""  
Me: ***selecting Nürburgring full.***"
"It gets everyone in the end. 

I think of it in quite large chunks, rather than corner by corner. There is a lot to learn but surprisingly few critical corners or big stops. You pick up landmark corners and sort of work out from those, and before you know it you've got it locked in your brain. Learned... but never mastered."
"AC is the Nordschleifer Simulator. Hoping it helps when I finally get to race it on iRacing :) Hundreds of laps done on there.

Assuming you meant the full ring and not just the track ha"
"I can fully agree with OP. I avoided it too for years. Went with a group of friends 2 years ago. Even got a passenger ride.

Came home and prepared for the Nürburgring 24hr while doing the 4hr NLS/VLN races. 

Now I absolutely love the track. Came 2nd in our split at last N24. 

Don't worry your not the only one OP 😄"
"Been doing thousands of laps per year in it since the GTR Evolution expansion to RACE 07 released in 2008, and since then in different games that have featured it.

Yet to put in a lap that I’ve felt I personally maximised. Still figuring out new things and finding lap time on it, even very recently.

It’s a part of your life now."
Wait till the NEC season opens back up. I’ve got way too many hours practicing and driving endurance events there. The fuel strat math is nice and easy when it’s 7-9 minute laps depending on vehicle.
"Definitely not the only one. I refused to drive it. Now that I have, it's so much fun!"
Now you need to go irl
It’s the first track i load up when testing a new car!   Hell it’s the first track i load up when testing a car in general
"I still get a thrill every lap, as I peel off the GP circuit, round Sabine Schmitz and head down the hill. Big grin on my face. Buckle up, here we go again.

The ultimate driving track."
"It's hate until it's love. Stick go it and learn the track completely, it is the love of my simracing life."
I literally have hundreds of thousands of miles on Nordschleife. I've been testing and tuning on the track since I first discovered it in GT3 or 4. It will humble you for sure. It still likes to remind me who's boss.
"I just started to get to grips with it last weekend, in AC not iRacing because the mods make it so very pretty. I'm having a hard time doing anything else now tbh... eyeing the Ring meister series with interest."
I know the feeling.  I never went on it until one week it showed up in the GT4 season and I decided to at least give it a practice... by the end of that first session it was my favourite track.
"It is a blast, I learned it in the skippy."
I’m curious why so many people avoid the consensus most significant track in motorsport. Is it because it’s a lot to memorize or really difficult?
"This week the IndyCar is there for 9 laps. 2 fuel stops, where you can take a 7 second breather than back on it.
After 63 minutes of hard driving, it is an immense feeling. Who cares about the results, it is beautiful gorgeous temple of racing."
You fool
I am skeptical that I can memorize all the corners of the full one with the amount of time I have for iRacing lol
In a Mazda MX5 💀
"Yeah same. I broke it up into I think 4 sections originally. Ran each over and over using the reset. Then I started stringing them together. Run through the section and keep going til I screwed up, then reset. Pretty soon I could do a whole lap. Now I’m trying to dial it in. 

I’m absolutely hooked. This is maybe my favorite thing I’ve done on iRacing lol. I’m already fantasizing about going to Germany and driving the real thing."
"Full ring. It can be complete carnage, but it can also build SR like CRAZY. Im looking forward to LMP2 next week."
Yeah the Nordschleife Industriefahrten is what I was running. I guess I’ll need to learn the track part as well because next week’s race is the combined circuit.
I only play for a few hours a week and I’ve learnt it. Super rewarding to get your first clean lap and start racing. Well worth it!
"Realistically there's \~30 corners/complexes that matter, and they're usually separated with long straights\*

\*usually not that straight, but you're flat out in almost every car anyway.

Sure there's 160 or whatever total corners, but if you take a look at *what matters,* there's really not all that much."
"Everyone is capable of remembering the Nordschleife, it’s really not that long."
"It’s really not that bad. The first bit is easy to memorize IMO up until the first long straight. Then I get a bit hazy, but it just feels very easy to drive the next portion even if you don’t have it memorized corner by corner."
".  There are 5 or 6 bad spots that you gotta be able to drive correctly and if you knwo where thye are, the rest is dead easy.  Love the place.  I dream of going one day.  Probably wont happen."
The Mx-5 is actually super fun around the Nordschleife
I can't wait for this. 2H 40m race next weekend - solo will be a proper endurance!
Gained my A license two times here. Can’t tell how many cars in how many laps I’ve been in the green hell
"My iRacing is on hibernation right now, but whenever I load it up I typically select the 992 Cup or GT3 and do a few laps. It's just so bloody good.

It's crazy how I'm *finally* starting to feel confident. Fast is a different matter though! :-)

It really helped to be part of a 24h team for a stint a year ago or so. I was the slowest by a large degree on our team (it was at night so completely terrifying!), but didn't add any incident points. (It was pretty cool to know that Max Verstappen / TR was doing the same event, in the top split.)"
Radical sr8 is probably the most rewarding free car to drive on the Nurb.
"There’s a ton of tuning info in the GR86 user manual on iRacing:

https://s100.iracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Toyota-GR86-Manual.pdf"
Congrats! Soon enough i hope to upgrade my g29 toy pedals
"Careful man, people are gonna downvote you for pointing out the more expensive equipment is much faster; they hate it. But congrats on the pedals and have fun!"
[deleted]
Honestly think they’re a waste of money… who uses brake pedals? There’s cars you can use for braking
How are load cells different exactly? What do they simulate better?
What is the approximate cost of this pedal in USD?
I just got my xp1 installed yesterday and just stock out of the box they feel so good.
"Im thinking to get LC pedals also, because it feel no matter how precise i try to be or smooth etc. I always leave around 1.5s on the table. I know someones are faster with potentiometer pedals, so maybe im relying to that i need to get better first"
"Just finished installing my sim jacks. Every runs fine in game. Just need to spend tomorrow tuning. I already have better control over approaching lock-up threshold after a few minutes, but everything is a bit wonky atm.

Definitely going to need at least a stiffer throttle spring, possibly the clutch as well. Both are still better than the G920s though.

Looking forward to really learning rotation balance on the brakes. Stumbled into it a few times but couldn't get anything consistent due to a lack of resistance. Not an issue now lol"
What would you like us to be looking at in this 2 minute video?
I can’t wait! I’ve been trying to find the best option for my price range.
They’re good to learn on for sure and load cells are just a next step. So worth it
"I mean, there is a point of diminishing returns but you gotta spend quite a bit to get there haha. I’m thinking of upgrading my CSP V3 pedals to maybe some VNM Lite pedals. I’ll spend a bit more, but I should gain quite a bit of precision with braking with the heavier load cell."
See ya on track!
"it's not necessarily about simulating anything to have a more realistic feel. That's what a hydraulic brake would be good for. 

It's more about consistency. With a potentiometer ( what cheap pedals use ) it uses the position of the pedal. With a load cell it uses the force. Your body has a really tough time with being able to return to the same spot in space. Imagine having your eyes closed and attempting to put your hand in the exact same spot in space every time. It's extremely difficult. So instead of having to modulate the position of the pedal, it reaches a certain point and then it's all about the force applied. Our brains are really good at modulating the amount of force needed for something. It's why you can eat with a fork without throwing food everywhere."
They don't 'simulate'... They're accurate.
They are currently around $500 USD depending on where you find them at. Micro Center had them at $499 for the 2 pedal set (no clutch)
I upped to the heaviest spring and it feels super good!
I felt i had gotten to the peak of what a potentiometer could give me and already have gained over a second around Daytona and even better I am way more precise and consistent
"Mainly it’s for attention, just wanted to share my thoughts on upgrades"
It's always a bit were the equipment can help you but it's not going to make you faster. One of the best guy in a league I'm in is on a 920 and the base pedals and has crazy speed and top 5% irating. I'm on a CSL DD 8nm and the load cell with it but I'm down at 800 iRating and have a pr of 46.8 at Daytona in practice with the endurance setup. Practice and talent trumps equipment at the end of the day.
That makes sense thanks
This is exactly why I upgraded! I have a heavy braking foot so I used the heaviest load cell force and now I can be extremely precise with my braking and way more consistent and confident that I will reach the same force every time
Thanks but I got an actually helpful answer already.
Zoinks
On both the brake and pedal?
Thats same time scaring because it will cost me alot😅
"Im 4000 on a g920 and have driven high end direct drives with load cell pedals. Its like comparing a toy to the real thing. The wheel is super loose compared to a dd. And the g920 pedal has 255 units on the calibration, while a load cell has 5000+.  Let alone the fact its about pressure, not distance pressed. If you know how to drive, you'll gain a lot of time with a good rig. So what you said is wrong because I cant compete with the people i should if i had a good setup. Which is fine, there are plenty of ppl like me, but stop with that ""talent trumps equipment"" bs because its simply not true at all. And with a good rig, practice time gets massively reduced aswell. Again, its ok, but to deny it is not."
Nice. 😎👍
He’s got some awesome pedals. Fanatec has entry level load Cell pedals in the 200-300 dollar range I’d you can’t afford those. They make a huge difference in lots of oval racing too.
Just the brake. The throttle feels good to me at the moment
Oh ok nice. I might try the heavier spring on the brake.
Ted working the till as always. 
"Yes, I also have the dd2 and it has these occasional microstutters that throw me completely off. It’s like a digital hiccup and it’s really terrible when it happens. I’ve heard that it might be caused by having the wheelbase plugged into a usb 3.0 port and they recommended trying a usb 2 port. You can even see it in the frame by frame replay where instantaneously the wheel is in a different position"
"Ahit aight, no ieda why a technically worse port, but i think i have it in usb 2, thanks anyway, its exactly what you said"
"&#x200B;

"The green line is appropriate but if I'm approaching faster than the guy in front, I'm taking the red line and then immediately dipping down into pit road to make sure I don't get hit from someone not paying attention like you did. 

Pit lane is dangerous, never assume that everyone will stay out of the way for you."
"Just aim for the pitstalls and you'll ghost straightaway. Why risk damage by doing a ""realistic"" pit entry"
"That white line on the left in the braking zone means nothing, there's no penalty for crossing it, so people will do that, as it's the shortest route. And being the shortest route, they will get alongside you. You just have to be aware, and use your mirrors."
Green line crossed into red line. sure running the red line is a bit inconsiderate if you really want to be that way BUT its a race and the point is to do everything as quick as possible and red line is that. there is no rule saying you can't do that.
red line. cars only ghost inside the pitboxes.
"I take the red line any time, road or oval. Wrecked an indy car in the pits 1 time, and it ended my race. Please file a protest, I've never heard from iracing in well over 1000 races. I know they care so much. So good luck, and hopefully they give me a vacation."
Oh can you just drive through the entire pitlane through the pitstalls so you're ghosted the whole time?
"Red is not the normal line. You’re supposed to be as far out as possible, next to the grass. If you’re driving the redline no one could get out of their pit box"
You are the reason iRacing sucks sometimes
"Yes. Once you cross into the stalls, you ghost. You can be hit anywhere in the fast lanes."
there are also no explicit rules for this on the road side. if you drive the green line.... go ahead. you are just giving time up to everyone else.
"There technically is a rule, I just don’t think anyone has ever tried to enforce it, possibly due to the wording about collisions with cars in pit stalls.

6.9.2. When leaving his or her pit stall, a driver shall as quickly as is practical enter the acceleration/deceleration lane in order
to avoid incidental contact with cars being automatically placed into nearby pit stalls. 

Similarly, a driver should remain in the acceleration/deceleration lane until just prior to entering his or her pit stall in order to avoid incidental contact with
cars being automatically placed into nearby pit stalls.

I’d be curious to see whether it could be something to protest or not, or better yet, if a staff member (realistically Nim) would be willing to shed some light on the interpretation for iracing.

IRL the red car would likely be penalised for not driving in the ‘speed’ lane, not withstanding green is still not allowed to simply drive into them"
"If you're worried about the time ""lost"" in pit road in a 24 hour race, you're not finishing high enough to care about the time ""lost"" on pit road.

""Lost"" is also in quotes because at pit speed, entering and observing basic etiquette (and usually enforced rules) , you're not saving or losing any time."
It is 100% protestable. Cutting the pits is successful protest every time.
i have had finishes in the d24 come down to less than a second for position. if you save 1s per pit entry.... thats over 24s across the entire race.... do what you want. others will take the narrow entry. while the others lose time to them. not sure what the issue is.
"One, you're not saving a full second by being one lane right at 50mph. You're not saving a thousandth of a second. You're not saving anything. 

Two, the issue is you cause wrecks by doing it. Hence why in the real world, it's not allowed.

Not sure how dense you have to be to not comprehend this."
you aren't thinking about it right. THE RED LINE is a WAY shorter distance to the entrance line. YOU DO save a lot of time running that line. Try it yourself.
"No, you're just way over-thinking it and adding absolute ton of importance when there is absolutely none.

One, shifting from the inside to outside line in the pits is not saving you much distance at all since it's a straight, parallel line and you're going to have to cover the distance from pit road to pit box regardless. We're literally talking a difference of 10'-15'.

Two, you're doing 55mph.

The time saved is based on distance and speed. The distance is already small and the speed is small, the time saved is infitismal.

Over 20 pit stops, you're saving maybe a hundredth of a second, not 20 seconds."
"ive beat people to pit entrance line by a lot because they run the green and i run the red. take it as you will. i dont think we are on the same page here because you seem focused on the part of BEING on pit road. i was pretty clear i was talking about pit entry....

regardless, lets talk about the gains from not being in the outside line vs inside.  Not sure how much of a gain it is but distance saved is distance saved. not sure how wide each lane is but lets say 20ft and you go from each lane to your pit box over 3 stalls or \~100ft. distance saved from being in the inside line is about 6ft. 102ft vs 108ft. at 55mph, 6ft is equal to about .07s. small amount. agreed. over 24hrs though... might make a small difference. the higher the split the more it matters."
"i actually measured it on google maps. its about 20ft shorter taking an extreme inside line to the pit road speed line. its another 10ft shorter to your pit box if you are fully to the left vs in the ""travel"" lane on pit road. 30ft at 55mph is .37s. i was a ways off on the number but not the impact. .37s over 24hrs of pit stops can make a difference."
You are racing ROOKIE Street stock. It’s for rookies
I literally drive dirt oval officials drunk and I feel like I’m not alone
"dirt oval is the toughest series for rookies, nothing malicious here, gotta learn how to go wheel to wheel somewhere "
Looks like he may have been using a controller instead of a wheel.
How do you know it was a kid?
Looks like they couldn't adapt to a different line with people in his. Also couldn't adapt to the wheel damage and just got worse. Plus if he couldnt adapt to those the track changing would also screw them up. They just need wheel to wheel in open practice for a few hours. Unless in skilled lobbies you can normally alter your line to avoid these people just watch your mirror and predict the path.
"I didn't show it in the video, but this guy was in D class."
Same got my first win plastered helped with first place anxiety held 19 laps calm as a cucumber.
After watching a few more times I still think it's skill issue he was bouncing off the wall when nobody was there. Can't say there was no intention but if everyone was taking a more optimal line he would have taken himself out anyway.
What was the SoF? That matters way more for driving standards
"I think it was 3632, if I remember correctly."
I honestly find that a little hard to believe based on the driving I see in this clip but I don't do much dirt oval racing so I'm not an expert.
"Forgot to add, I am the dark green Aston"
Great battle! 👍🏻 nice to see the faster class keeping out the way as well haha
"Mate this is amazing gg!  
If you created this at the start of the season so it's ready from week 1 I will happily pay for it."
Clean
These are sick dude. Nice work
"nice work.   have you ever thought about doing a combined schedule, like one for each of road, oval, dirt and dirt oval?"
Looks great. What about some dark version? It would be even greater :)
Too white for my eyes!!!
"NO, YOU'RE AWESOME!"
"Looks very clean, I love it!  
Bookmarked straight after the first look"
"Thank you! No need to pay, these schedules will always be free.

If you like the work, consider buying me a cup of coffee. https://www.buymeacoffee.com/boxboxdesign"
Would be nice to have it presented like a real promotional poster!
"Under which Violation would you protest it?

If you know the answer than you don't have to ask if you should protest."
"If you think he would've made the corner, then it's more likely it wasn't on purpose and you need to improve at that corner. You may have caught them off guard

It's still that guys fault though, if this was in a league they'd get a penalty, but just not in iracing official races."
Dumb move but I wouldn't say it's protestable
It’s just bad driving
Protest
Slam dunk.
"What’s up with the massive speed different? If I remember F4 correctly, that corner is just a lift. If you hit the brakes and turned in…I dunno…you might have just caught him off guard"
"i doubt that was intentional, seems like he made a mistake or had a brain fart.

one time at le mans, it was the start of a race and somehow my mind blanked and instead of the corner-before-indiapolis i thought i had just turned mulsanne corner. i full throttled right into the back of the dude in front of me not expecting him to brake. i felt terrible, he was pissed, and he did not believe me that i had a brain fart and forgot where i was on track LOL

this seems like the same thing"
"it felt like an intentional wreck, but looking at the replay it seemed more of a reckless move. I'm still pretty new so wanted to get some other opinions"
"Yeah, that was the first lap so I was being more cautious anyway, but this incident did help me realize I was breaking more than I needed to there. I guess some lessons are more painful than others!"
"I can understand why they have the cooldown period after a race, I was heated after it happened but I think you're right, seems just overly aggressive and not quite what a protest is for I guess."
Wrong sport mate
"I've had those moments too to be fair, though luckily so far I've only ever wrecked myself as a result"
"Yeah, an intentional wrecking protest should be very obvious. If it can be classified as a dumb move or a mistake it shouldn't be protested."
"It happens, I used to be over-cautious and get punted on the opening lap all the time. It's better to lift before a turn than brake early, you bleed enough speed to still be able to react to something, but can let off the brakes sooner and get great exits without losing much time if nothing is wrong."
Well at least it didn't happen on the last lap
66 ping = ~10 ft at 100 mph.
I have the same case in F4 on tsukuba
What is this filter?
"Why do people blur out the names? Y’all do know your name is displayed on the site, on everyone’s screen, and on people’s stream, etc. What are y’all trying to hide?"
"No filter you can use unfortunately, just did a bit of chromatic aberration, little play with the grade and a subtle glow in there finished off with a vignette. Quick and dirty ha. I work in VFX so i just ran it through Nuke compositing software."
VR
"I didn't know if there was a thing about showing names etc, didn't want to risk it ha. Only took a few mins anyway :)"
Reddit is public. Iracing is not public.
"Reduce CA effect, increase that color distortion I see in the corners.  Lift black levels but increase contrast, but don't reduce highlights.

Can you get this in for afternoon dailies...and if not...see you Saturday?"
Haha atleast understand the question before you answer lol
"Ah I guess it is Reddit, idk what I was thinkin tbh lol

Reddit is creepy af"
"iRacing is most definitely public, just not free.

Doesn’t negate the fact someone is most likely in your race, streaming to the world.

What do you think is gonna happen with a name “leak”"
"It was a joke. VR has always given this washed out color tint for me.

I can agree it wasn't a good one."
Oh ok sorry it didnt seem like a joke lol on a side note though i have never experienced washed out colours in VR before
"Brake Bias is huge. And often misunderstood but it really doesn’t need to be. Forward = more understeer, rear = more oversteer. 

In fact at some tracks you can get some serious gains by learning to adjust brake bias during the lap! High speed corners can in some cars tolerate much more rear brake bias because of the additional downforce and you can get better rotation and better exits while maintaining a higher speed. But then in low speed corners move it forward for more stable braking. Takes some practice but this is something real world drivers do too."
"Meanwhile im doing 21s or even 23s at best this week.

I think the game is telling me to focus on ovals"
"Unless I'm wrong, moving the bias rearward usually gives you more overall braking but with more oversteer on turning and less stability in a straight line. If the bias is far up front the rear brakes are doing less work which increases stopping distance. I think it's usually best to put it as far rearward as you can control. But this is coming from someone who rarely touched the balance because I don't notice much between the two extremes."
"You have to find the right balance, too much rear bb and you will sacrifice exit traction as the rears will be hotter than normal."
"Telemetry.

BB isn't some magical fix, like TC or other in car settings. Spend the money and compare your inputs with the ones from the aliens. Best way to see what you are doing different and where/why you lose time."
Absolutely. I’ve contemplated trying a bit of this as turn 5 is a bit tough at charlotte with the rear bias. If it were a bit more stable I think there’s a tenth or two for me in being able to carry more speed through t5 before hitting the brakes but I’ve avoided doing it for now.
Is it possible to assign a button(s) to a specific brake bias setting? Where you could one touch press each button back and forth between two bias settings?
"That’s a pretty good generalisation. As far rearward as you can control. It’s never that simple of course, I could drive slower and slower while moving it further back. So there has to be a point where you’re stopping gaining lap time from it. But the point of my thread is to actually practice a bit with an unstable car to find the point where you’re gaining time.  The aliens always seem to have so much grip and rotation.  I’m finding more rotation with this fix."
Yes for sure. I’m not suggesting full rear is the fastest. But my speed and car control has improved by learning to “cope” with a more unstable lively car.
"I’ve definitely done this but here’s what people will find, as did I.  Alien can brake later and carry more mid corner and exit speed pretty much every turn the whole lap. And they’ll be left wondering how and trying and running wide and deep etc.  

There’s a whole bunch of reasons how they can do this. I’m hoping to inspire some folks who are close ish to begin with. Perhaps they can unlock some time by trying what I’ve suggested. 

If you’re 3 plus seconds off, you’ll improve by fixing your lines and hitting apexes regardless of brake bias."
"Not that I’m aware of, but I can adjust the bias with  my wheel in game. I just have to notice what I’ve changed it to on the dash or with various overlays."
"No, but I'm almost positive there is an ini setting for how fine each ""click"" can be."
I don’t think so. I just kind of memorize how many clicks on my encoder I need as I go around the track.
"You nailed it with one of the things you said about carrying more speed through the corner. It’s one thing to nail all your braking points, apexes and exits, but if you have mastered this and find yourself still .5 or 1 second off pace from really quick people, it’s likely exactly this. Carrying more speed through the corner is essentially the result of better overall technique when it comes to trail braking, and brake bias can be an element of this. This is where telemetry can be a big help. Another solid tip that I’ve picked up after chatting with *really* fast people is that it’s okay to brake earlier and lighter. This can help keep the car’s balance more predictable, ultimately allowing you to carry more speed through the corner. A lot of people think that braking as late as possible is the way to gain time, but sometimes it’s just the opposite."
"Yes exactly, when I first put the BB rearward as an experiment I was driving so carefully, braking early and lightly, in my first lap I was only down by a couple tenths getting onto the oval and I new right then that this was going to be a key for me to gaining lap time. I’m down not to a 1:16 flat. That’s a full 6 tenths faster than my previous PB"
"No, there isn't an ability to revoke permission to race a car but they're adding that functionality ""soon"""
No but it tends to increase once you read and understand the sporting code like you said you did.
Nope.
No
No but its harder to gain SR depending on your license.
Go to iracing website. They have a manual that tells you how it works
"Sort of.

The type of car makes no direct impact. The only things that impact your SR is license class, number of incidents and number of corners driven.

So it's easier to gain SR if you have a 0x race in the F3 over F4, simply because in the F3 you're driving faster so drive more corners in the race than in an F4. But had you drive the same number of corners in both cars, you'd have gained the same SR."
No
Get roasted OP🔥
How do you figure this? Been around the service 12 years and never heard of such a thing
On top of this the longer races of the higher classes tend to help. Things settle down and the field spreads out so it's easier to minimise incidents towards the end.
https://preview.redd.it/va2hh348wndc1.png?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a08078d755877b1e20b9aaca2249953725e9c564
"Depending on your license, the number of corners per incident for SR calculation changes. The higher the license, the more corners per incident."
I’ve been on the service 30 days and have seen it referenced here multiple times and have heard discussions for it in-game.
Is it in the sporting code or something? I very well may have missed it. Just have never heard this before
"I don’t believe it is no, the language in the sporting code is merely that there’s a “formula” 

However as is the way of the internet folks have “done the math” so to speak, and experimented, and have kind of “figured out” the formula. Plus experience should show that higher license classes have much more “fragile” safety ratings."
Checkered flag means you're finished with your qualifying run. Looks like you accidentally clicked the Ready to Race button that ends your qualifying run.
"It’s your internet connection. Ping is super higher, internet is poor"
"This looks like you clicked “Ready to Race”? The chequered flag means your qualifying is completed.

Your internet connection is fine, by the way. Pretty standard for being in a different continent to the server. I get similar connection stats and have never experienced any problems with the sim."
I see thanks
"Were you not able to qualify? Your ping isn’t that bad. I regularly have ping of 200, because I often get stuck in splits full of drivers in Europe (I’m in the US)."
I don't see anything
"Probably that, thank you"
That’s a normal ping from Australia/Asia to the US. I don’t see how that has anything to do with the shortening of qualifying being cancelled.
"Rather, your connection to server is poor."
"That might have been it, im a total beginner.

Thanks mate"

"Man how do you get around this track safely? 

I race road 90% of the time so oval to me is like a relaxing break that I don't care about being competitive with. I just struggle with exits a lot and slide like this video or I'm pretty far off the pace I'd like to be."
Lol
That jump was clean
"You forgot ""Ta Dah!!"""
Wow
I’m newer to iracing and this track has been harder than any other oval that I’ve experienced. I have yet to go to a race here because I can barely consistently make it around the track without spinning out. I’d ruin everyone’s day.
"Its hard to tell from the video, but assuming you're hitting the brakes and the car is coming around on you, have you tried adjusting the brake balance? Sometimes increasing the front brake balance can help keep the car from losing the rear end as easy, but will also mean you need to brake just a little sooner. So I would try and see if that helps you if you haven't tried it already.

It could also be if you're being smooth on the braking/letting off the gas or not. Or steering before you're on the brakes. Flatter tracks like Langley here have this issue more than banked ones like Charlotte I think. 

That said its been a hot minute since I've driven the street stock regularly (mainly been the ARCA car for about a year or so now), so I could be wrong, but these are things that affect me in the ARCA car too. I remember Langley being hell in the ARCA car too, having to run in 3rd instead of 4th. lol"
You'll find them sometimes posted about in here or other subreddits. Kinda just have to spot someone talking about when they're recruiting and join in. It's good fun getting a consistent group of people racing. RIL runs every Sunday evening but have a new track and car each week. This Sunday is an oval and the guys are great people I'd suggest popping into the discord.
My races are similar except I fight for last on the first lap
Mr Bovine Joni
Congrats. I ran the 8:30 pm cst Gen 4 race (maybe different split) and got caught up in a wreck in front of me that took out 5+ cars at around the 46th lap. It's so hard to pass with 2 freight train lines running next to each other bumper to bumper. A few times we had 3 wide lines going... one mistake and 1/4 of the field gets wiped out. But damn it gets tense inside that pack for 10+ straight laps bumper to bumper. 
"[Racing/Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/?f=flair_name%3A%22Racing%2FResults%22)

Was an intense race. I don't often race oval (more of a road racer) but enjoy a good speedway race every now and then i.e. Talladega and Daytona. Started near the back of the grid 16/21 Drivers. Slowly made my way up after a couple of cautions and only pitting once for fuel, Lightning McQueen style lmao, and thought it bit me in the ass right at the end, but i found myself at the front of the pack with 9 to go. The start of this clip is 2.5 L left. Enjoy!"
Do you drive with that head tilt (on the banking turns) or is it just in the replay? It looks very disorienting to me.
"Unlucky dude, sounds like a typical lobby lol. Number 6 that caused the accident was racing like he thought he was bloody Earnhardt all race finally got what he deserved."
"Just the replay man, couldn’t drive like this at all lol. Just thought it would be a bit of a wider POV"
"Hey im also looking for someone to race with, dm me on discord if you still are looking my username is Reddekz"
"A lot of cars have downshift protection, where in you can't downshift until you are in a safe rpm range.

https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000157032-transmission-gearbox-shifting-types-method

Handy link that lists gearbox types, and shifting methods for cars. Also shows which cars have this downshift protection behavior."
downshift protection to protect the engine
"Which GT cars are you referring to?  if it's GT1, you should probably enable auto blip instead of the default anti stall clutch."
Gotcha! So it’s a GT and GTP car thing? Or just GT?
The Ferrari GT3 and Aston Martin GT4. But I figured out what it is now thanks to some help on here
most fancy cars got it.
"Depends on the car itself. Some have it, some do not.

However, if you are routinely hitting it; it sounds like you might be downshifting too early. So it might be a good habit to break. A common rookie mistake is downshifting so that the engine is nearly at redline once you downshift. That’s not ideal; it usually results in a lot more engine braking than you would typically want and it doesn’t leave any headroom for transitioning onto the throttle. It’s the kind of bad habit that can be worth a tenth or two over a lap."
"To give a recount, i spun off the track and accidentally put down a save point, but i think when i saved it, i was clipping into the ground, so whenever i reset to that save point, id be launched upwards, i possibly could have gone faster than 5284 mph in one of the resets"
You forgot the 1.21 gigawatts. Rookie mistake.
"I used to do this a lot, the key for me was racing against myself. I wouldn't try and go quicker, but I'd try to hit the same time lap after lap and really focus on it.

I'd obviously keep an eye on the guy behind but unless he's alongside I don't really care too much what he's doing

If my max consistent pace is faster than him I'll win and drive away, if not then I'll be battling and I tend to focus up and not really make many mistakes. The danger was when I was in clean air with a 10 second lead and racing myself really helped me to keep focus"
Are you me?
"Watch your pace, you’re getting too cocky.
Also stop looking at your mirror"
For me I think I do it because I have the attention span of a carrot and just get really bored so the only time I don't do this is street circuits.
"Turn off your deltra during races. You see it and want it to always be green. So you keep pushing harder and harder when you should be going slower and more deliberate to ensure the win.

The first thing you need to do is learn ""In order to win you first have to finish."""
"As others have said, try turning off any unnecessary stuff on your screen. Focus forward and trust your ability. Unless you got into first because the top 5 guys all went off track and now they are coming for you, just drive a nice even pace. I find the harder I push the slower I go, realize too that the guys behind will be pushing and if you stay smooth they will probably make mistakes or slow each other down fighting. I try to take a “cleansing” breath once a lap because I find myself not breathing as I should."
"I relate. My best lap times are when I'm chasing a guy on the last lap on worn tires. Something about not having a referance used to trip me up but like everything it just comes with doing it over and over again. 

p.s. watch out for that ""I'm actually going to win"" cocky feeling"
"It's all mental, you need to work on your mental game, funny enough I've got into iracing to practice my mental racing mindset for other sports

pretty much stop overthinking it when you are leading, try to relax and find the flow again"
"Me too, my number of wins is half my pole positions. I just think it comes with experience, I’m getting more comfortable with having drivers behind me. Take a deep breath and just focus on your brake markers. Don’t push too hard, the car behind still needs to overtake you."
"Control your emotions, it's as simple as that I think. We sometimes get nervous and overdo things when we sense we have something to lose. To me, the thinking is: this is all fun and games, it won't make any difference if I finish P1 or not (although that's clearly bollocks, I manage to fool myself)."
"Take each turn after the other. Forget everything, just execute the pace you know without forcing it. That also helps when you make mistake and feel the pressure to not fail again. Forget it and just focus on the next turn."
How far are you leading? I try to relax more when I see I'm several seconds ahead. If there's a good gap then you can afford to be more cautious to maintain your lead. I struggle when people are behind me because I start driving differently if I don't catch myself.
"Run some time trials, probably the easiest way to practice dealing with the pressure you put on yourself while there's something on the line.

Otherwise, think of it this way. You're not first until that checkered flag drops, until then you're just keeping that spot warm. Just get into your rhythm, don't try to set personal bests, try to keep your lap times within a tenth, even if it means you're incrementally going faster as the fuel burns off and use your head if you've got back markers to lap"
"Take it one braking point and one apex at a time. I feel my mind drifting so I have to super focus on my next braking point. Like, laser vision on it. It stops me from getting distracted."
"I find I race my best in first. It's like I get it and my flow state immediately triggers. I know all that matters is that I run clean and consistent.

Let me be mid pack and watching the car ahead of me gain ground... nope I'm gonna struggle with that."
"Thanks for the tips everyone! I knew it was something mental, but I didn't know what to do.

Gonna try having a stream or something playing in the background. Also, talking to myself while driving seems to be a good idea"
Race the track not the other drivers. The easiest positions to drive in are 1st and last
"It’s just so boring leading a race all by myself, this happens to me also sad to say."
"> I wouldn't try and go quicker, but I'd try to hit the same time lap after lap and really focus on it.

I started turning on my sector time overlay for races and it helped me immensely with this, just by giving me a measuring stick by which I can keep in mind how I'm doing in each sector over every lap, but I also have ADHD so your mileage may vary.

I've found it a *lot* easier to focus myself when I see that I'm slipping from my previous time diffs, and having sub-lap milestones to hit and validate against are hugely helpful at maintaining that focus.

EDIT: Not the delta bar though, that thing is evil."
That's why I listen to podcasts or videos or music during races.
"I love having delta on during races. It helps me focus. Whenever it's off I start getting sloppy and missing apexes. 

I think as long as you are mindful not to chase PBs and just use it as reference, it can be helpful to get you in a groove. I know for a fact I'm way more consistent with it on.

Just my two cents though, I suppose it has the opposite effect for some people."
"It really depends on which delta bar. 


Session best for sprint races and last lap for tire management races are super useful. 


Driving with the PB delta bar like is just going to induce overdriving. "
I didn’t know you could even enable the delta during races! Glad it’s off by default because that’s indeed an extra stress factor.
"I only have my relative box, just to be aware of my surroundings, and the virtual mirror. I think it’s a mix of overconfidence and anxiety. "
I find myself doing better while chasing unless they are substantial faster than me and then I get demoralized and they pull away. I just fix my gaze on the back of their car and things flow around me. As long as I don't follow their mistakes which is a possibility.
"The last time this happened I was around 4s ahead, but it happens even if I’m 9 or more seconds ahead. I might have to start having a stream or something in the background has some people already mentioned"
I prefer just having lap times read to me by crew chief each lap but as you say it's personal preference.
"I was against it for a while but am starting to join your camp too. I set it to compare against the previous lap and that way sometimes it's red, sometimes it's green, I just try to keep it within a few tenths"
"I use the PB one during races, except for on dirt, where I have Last Lap. 

I don't chase the time though, I just reference it for pace. I just give it a glance once in a while to see if I'm being too conservative. I use that and the relative to manage the gap if I'm leading, or if I'm trying to chase someone down. 

I use the last lap on dirt to see if moving around the track is an improvement or not. I'm just starting to try and really learn dirt ovals though. I'm always a bit behind the fast guys in finding the right line.

My last race, I learned something from having it on too, so that was a big bonus. I'm around 2800 iR and the leader was in the mid-4K range. He out qualified me by .3 at Sebring, so I expected that I would be able hang close for a few laps and then he'd begin to pull away. (That's my usual pattern, haha.) Since I was on his bumper, I had backed up my braking points a bit and was braking a little softer to maintain the gap, and I was picking up a few tenths on my PB every lap. I also learned a better way to take a couple corners that I've always struggled with. 

If you can put it on without racing yourself and not get fixated on it, I think it's really useful in races."
Same. There for practice and quali but not in races.
What a save!
"woow, I loved the drift entering the turn at the end, super cool"
Unreal save. I'd love to see your telemetry for that one.
Nice...
Tokyo drift
Phionex? I can't spell
"Hey could you tell me how you recorded this replay?

My proces is cut replay, start recording with obs, hit space to hide ui (i don't want names to be seen) but then I have to edit the video and cut first second because when iRacing gets focus back the ui is visible.

This is really cumbersome and I hope there is better way"
Nice save...had me tensed up...
Sick. The save on the initial hit is the most impressive to me. I would have plowed the inside wall before I could even react.
"Here's the correct title: my biggest ""oval"" save so far. Phoenix isn't an oval, it's an egg"
DEJA VU
Great job on both the wheel and the pedals.
how’d u get the replay of thisv
"I love those races. Small tip. Run a large steering ratio and offset the steering. This is a more accurate to real life setup and will make it harder to save the truck, but it will give you the precision that is crucial on ovals."
"NICE!!!!

What a save, don't tnkink I would have got that one."
I'll admit it - I'd have lost that one.  Great save!
Man i need your fov view
Good hands!! 👏👏👏
Wowsers. That was awesome
Beautiful
That was Great.
Wow. That was impressive.
What a save!
[got you](https://youtu.be/dKKvHy6ReNE)
"I just use gamesbar/xbox overlay/  just start the replay, hit space, press windowskey+G and start the recording and stop it via that over lay without editing it or trimming replay in iracing"
That is a wild fov isn’t it?
I play in VR so when im recording on the monitor i think its showing the driver fov at 100
What a save!
"Good looking out. Thanks, man. Good patience and footwork."
"ohh, ok, thank you ^^"

"The apron is not considered racing surface, but on the straights (including tri-oval) it is legal to go down there. Caveat is since it is not racing surface, it is on them to rejoin safely, they are not obligated space to rejoin either. If they cause a wreck, it can be protested as an unsafe rejoin."
"Okay, thanks for the explanation. If I see a driver check up and drop out of the draft on the left apron, I'll try & let them back in to avoid the big one, unless the white flag is out or if someone is drafting on my bumper."
Feels like actually traveling and not just lapping on a course.
Its like riding a rollercoaster but you are at the wheel.
"Elevations, difficulty, amount of turns and the community. I also live 2 hours away from the track and take my miata occasionally. Such legendary place."
"Lots of turns, with some fun straights. Visually looks great too, also the distance. Tight roads as well, I love everything about it."
"Definitely feels like you are bombing it down the back roads, clinging on for dear life that you don’t make a mistake and end up putting into the wall 😂"
"The focus shifts entirely away from hitting that perfect apex every corner and fighting cars around you, to fighting yourself and the track itself. It's not about the perfect line and speed each corner, but to keep the speed and flow up for, what frankly is a continuous 20km 'sequence' of corners all leading to each other. No other track has so many consecutive corners where, if you're off-line in the first, you lose tons or are well off line 8 corners later. It's the only track where you can truly get into a full flow-state and ride the rollercoaster. Being half a car's width wide in T87 doesn't matter to your overall laptime, but it can ruin the flow and suddenly you find yourself unfocussed and losing time hand over fist.

It's akin to the bathurst mountain section, just much faster and 20kms long. A good half of the laptime at bathurst is spent on straights, relaxing, not even near a tenth of the time at nords is just going straight and relaxing, there's one place that lets you do that, and then it's another 6-7ish minutes of pure focus. I don't much enjoy racing it, only in the slowest, smallest cars can you really race there, but man, flying around that place in a prototype or openwheeler, there's nothing like it. It's more a test of composure and mentality than ultimate car control"
"There aren’t “a lot of hard corners” until you are trying to get by someone. At that point, the easy corners even have teeth. You may have to follow someone for a kilometer or two before you can safely get by."
"If there’s a track with more unsighted apexes than the Ring, then I don’t know about it. 

Unforgiving. 

I have the hardest time with its curbs. Need to ride them the least. 

Narrow.

And, IRL, one part of the track can be sunny and dry and it’s throwing it down."
It's very similar to British B roads (width wise) and length is long enough that it doesn't get repetitive.
"Probably an unpopular opinion but I'm not a massive fan.

It's really difficult to overtake on apart from the long straight and crashes just bounce back on to the track causing pileups."
It's the greatest bit if tarmac engineer every made! It's even more mental in real life on tourist days. It's a mythical place. A Mecca for car enthusiast. It holds the greatest multi class  24 hour race in the world. I also agree it makes you fall in love with any car. Then you try that car at a normal track and hate it. And yes VIR is the American mini ring. And oulton park is the UK's mini ring.
"I actually find the Nordschleife to be full of hard corners for 2 reasons. 1) some of them are longer than I expect or shaped in a way that makes them hard to run standard lines if that makes sense. 2) From the carousel to the Dottinger Höhe feels so sketchy in a GT3, like you could die at any second if you upset the car at all, it’s so bumpy and the GT3s require so much smoothness to be fast.

I find racing on it to be frustrating because I’m slow lol and it’s so long that the relative is never right so I never know if I’m actually catching someone."
i have never liked it. Dont know why
"It's good solo, when you really break it down the racing is so bad, you basically just wait to pass or get passed on the final stretch lol anything else that happens is a mistake"
"It's a GREAT track, NOT a great racing track."
Sometimes I have to shed a tear of joy when driving it...
At least something on motorsport that only Germany has after loosing F1 completely. I watched some races there and it was always great. And to ride it now on iRacing with my DIY motion system is such a great experience. How it goes up and down. I even recognized the places from where I watched the races in real life.
"I’m not a fan of it. I don’t mind driving it, it’s got to the point now where it is nice to hot lap on in a few cars. But, I’m slow as hell on it. In every car, even my normally fast cars like the Clio and TCR, I am many seconds off the average times for my IR. I don’t understand why I’m so slow. 

That’s why I dislike it."
Never gets old!
"Because, yes."
"I love to drive it, but it can be a clown show during races.

It's great because It has nice flow to it with all kinds turns."
"I still have never driven it, will always skip it on iracing. Don’t think I have enough time to learn such a long track.
Am I really missing out? It always looks like you can’t really overtake until the big straight from what I see from it."
"I feel like I’m driving by the seat of my pants around the ring. It’s a lot less repetitive and requires complete focus, which as someone with ADHD makes a 45 minute race feel like 20."
"One aspect that I haven't heard mentioned is how readable the track is.  I'm guessing elevation has a lot to do with this, but you can just see so many of the turns before you're in them, it doesn't have many blind crests in the middle of corners, and you can just kind vibe through a lot of it and feel fast without a ton of practice."
"High barrier to entry with a steep skill curve. I’ve lapped it hundreds if not thousands of times and know it like the back of my hand - if someone else is keeping up with me, then I know they’ve also put the time in to learn every inch of tarmac. 

Also, with that comes the fact that I still have a lot to learn about the track and can always improve. There are seconds left to gain, not tenths like it is when you reach the limit on most tracks.

Hell one time in AMS2 I ran an AI race at night, and the class of cars had no headlights, unknowingly. I started the race - it was pitch black and all I could see were a few taillights ahead of me. It ended up being quite fun as a test for how well I really knew the track."
"Cause it's long, so it doesnt get boring. Each lap has a unique experience"
"Hah, never looked at it this way."
I'm so jealous.
"and I think it is pretty cheap too, right?"
"I really love the track, and yesterday i had the opportunity to use my son's quest3 to lap it. Man, it really came to life for me. The elevation changes, the turns that are coming towards you. I wish i lived closer, because only that can top the experience."
Best answer to match your name
I never said racing on or overtaking somebody on the Nordschleife was easy :-)
"\>  And, IRL, one part of the track can be sunny and dry and it’s throwing it down.

\#soon !"
"Yup, very true. Not the best track to race on, for sure."
I see it more of a hot lap challenge than a regular racetrack
Very true!
"Same. I've given it a shot, numerous times. Don't enjoy it in the least.

At this point, I don't think half the people who blather on about it even like it, just jump on the Nords bandwagon."
What I said :-)
"I feel like for me, I am noticing this is more common with super popular tracks.

I think for me at not extremely popular tracks I can get by knowing the track mostly, but not having every corner 100% down.

At popular tracks(spa, bathurst, daytona, the ring), I think people just have way more laps down. So for me I really have to have every corner down to be competitive. 

In other words. People have a shitton of laps down at those tracks, so it takes longer to get even with them then on the less popular tracks where competitors At similar IR don’t have as many laps at the track."
"You're seconds off because time gaps are ""relative"". Let's say you're 5% slower than the fastest lap, so let's say 0.5s difference in a 5km circuit. The length of the 'ring is 25kms -ish, so 5 times longer than the reference 5km circuit. Now, 0.5s slower on a 5km circuit, equals 2.5s in the 25km circuit. It's not you, it's the sheer length of the place ""distorting"" time :)"
"You are missing out, but not for the racing, that is usually a 'follow the leader until the straight' or capitalising on mistakes, but it is absolutely a huge test of your mental strength and focus. I find it 'simple' to learn as a track, none of the corners are super difficult on their own, and learnimg where it goes isn't too tough either, but keeping the car on the road for multiple laps is increeibly tough"
Around 30 euro for a lap
"Yeah VR experince is really good. got older quest, did that too before going to the ring first time in real life. Shocking part is elevations are actually brutal, you lift off or sink in your seat, my first lap was just about getting used to that rollercoster feeling."
😂😂
It teaches you patience while racing. You just know that the driver in front of you WILL have a momentary lapse of judgement and you will have to be prepared for it. The track really demands full attention.
Yeh that’s a good point I guess. I’ve definitely not done as many laps around Nords than I have other tracks. Some cars I just can’t see how I can be competitive in them as I am so much slower so the motivation to practice more is very low.
"Might buy it once the Porsche Cup is there this season, see what all the fuss is about.
Always avoided it because if felt it would be impossible to learn."
Best toll road ever.
"And around 400 for the ring taxi, being a passenger in a Porsche or AMG Mercedes. Maybe book Mischa as driver."
"Yea honestly I jusy practice enough to be ready for race. I don’t care about irating enough to practice for hours now that Im decent.

But I have noticed I have done enough races at spa now where I can match my irating. But at Bathurst still pretty slow"
"Watch a few onboard laps of different cars, IRL too, you should be learning where it goes quite quickly. After that, realise that races there aren't won by the guy who is fastest, but the guy who is most co sistent and resilient. Don't expect of yourself to know it like you might know RA and be able to push to 100%, that's not the point of it. I won a race today tgere in the indycars. I wasn't fastest, but i kept my car clean and made no errors over the 70minutes or so. Beat a few much faster guys, 4K+, but with all their speed, they couldn't keep their wing in one piece.
Point is - this track is not about maximising every corner, braking zone and acceleration zone, novody will get away with trying that for long periods of time. A lap or two, sure, but pushing 100% for every tenth, after 3 laps or more, you will make a mistake, even if minor. A minor mistake often means a DNF."
I'd definitely pay that for an AMG. My only request: scare me.
"Oh I did not know that part, sounds like something to do if I ever go there"
">A lap or two, sure, but pushing 100% for every tenth, after 3 laps or more, you will make a mistake, even if minor. A minor mistake often means a DNF.

Definitely my problem,  especially practicing for the IMSA race there this weekend. Lap four, hit a kerb just a little bit wrong and I'm into the wall before I can even fart."
"yeah that's the thkng once you take fast, downforce cars there. half an inch off line and you're race ends in a spectacular shunt. Miatas. gr86, even gt3s and gt4s can still take quite a lot of kerb, not fast or consistent but you don't die instantly"
Bold of you to assume that I can put 12 consecutive laps around Mount Panorama without crashing.
"Not sure why but reddit took out my text. I never passed anyone in actual racing, just when they binned it on the mountain. Just wanted to remind the bads like me sometimes just not crashing is enough haha"
This also often applies to the Nordschleife
"I've had the slowest fastest lap in the split and finished 5th here, you went four better!"
Everyone else looking at your best lap time probably pissed as hell. Lmao.
"I'm too scared to enter a race, just been practicing and can't do more than a few ""fast"" laps without making a mistake."
"That's incredible and I love it, congrats!"
It’s a crash fest with the sports car challenge. With a GT-4 and Lmp .
"Might be running this weekend lol. The track makes me nervous though as I'm already trying to boost my rating from coming back to the game after 3 years off.

Do people mostly respect not sending it 3 wide up the mountain? lol"
"Never raced here, what makes this track so brital?"
"Mount Panorama is over, thank god for that. iRating and love of racing took a battering after 3 pile ups. Love that track when it's just me on it."
"Mount Panorama was the best racing I’ve had in GT4 in a while. It was especially fun when I came across someone who could control their car well enough through the mountain section to be respectful while battling. 

LMP3 was fun until I accidentally reverted to using the GT4 braking points 🤣."
"Damn winning with a 2:06 as the best lap. That's embarassing for everyone else in this split lol

Edit:

![gif](giphy|enqnZa1B5fRHkPjXtS|downsized)"
Especially in the lmp3
I think the trick is the downhill sector has less time to gain than other places on the track. You can put down good times while taking the downhill section safely as long as you prioritize your exits going into the long flat out sections.
"you are not alone, fun track but I cannot push the car without crashing going downhill so decided not to ruin my SR"
From what I have seen for the most part yes. There is some dudes in lmp3 that try to hard and can’t keep it together and blow them selves to hell coming down the hill. But from what I have seen it’s been a pretty well unspoken agreement to not fuck around on the mountain coming down. Uphill it’s still full send if you can pass safely do it
"Lot of dramatic elevation changes in a short period, pretty high speeds in it and zero run off in the more difficult sections. Get it wrong you are 98% going to smash into a wall and be out of the race"
Sandown feels real boring after rudskogen and Bathurst not gunna lie. Even with passing the gt4s
I would assume that turned into an eat the wall situation? 😂
Zero reason to push it if people are flying into walls
Whats the point of being fast if you can't finish?
this
"Practiced it on the GT4 this week and entered my first race. Came out the other side in 4 place.  
Not racing it again learned my lesson running Daytona a few weeks back where I ended losing 400+ irating in a week."
Yeah but thats like 7 seconds off pace
"I would rather be 7 seconds off pace, finish and win than be on pace, crash and not finish/hobble across the line."
"Correct. I had had the lmp3 less then a week and been in iRacing less then a month. I’m not upset about my racing time being slow if it’s a win. Not going to push for a hot lap time when I can chill do easy constant 2:07-2:10 and get a win with zero risk

Edit: and I let the gt4 people have one less lmp getting in the way of their race and waited easy open spots to go ahead. They all seemed jazzed to have one less lmp cutting them up and taking away their chance at a pass."
"Nothing wrong with that, but i'd rather be on pace and maybe crash than cruise and hope for other people to crash."
All good mate. Doesn't sound very fun to me but to each their own.
"That’s totally fair. It’s not a hope for people to crash, the writing was just on the walls (literally) very quick and the lmp3 is a handful that if I’m pushing I’m not finishing 15 laps 😂 still have a lot to learn about that car."
"I'd love to have more track guides. I like the Dave Cam track guides from Traxion (RIP), but there is a lot of time left on the table. Dave Cam's own race pace is often much faster than his fastest lap in the track guide."
I like having multiple resources. I typically will drive a few laps on a new track and then compare my results in VRS. Then I watch their guide and goto YouTube and watch another 1-2 guides then hit the track again. This would be another resource for me to compare against my own driving.
"One thing that would make track guides more helpful would be more nuanced guidance on things like how quickly you should downshift on a given breaking point, what level of breaking is optimal, etc. Most of this can be gauged by following the telemetry but always helpful to have a talk track as well."
"Look up the CMS racing league in iracing, they have a MX-5 league focusing primarily on driver development!"
"For sure, I think a huge part of building better track guides is also to sort of revisit the guide at the end of the week too.  


Often, I'll find a few tenths by the weekend just by nailing to consistency.  I've been running Sebring a lot lately, and you sort of switch from the headspace of thinking about how to not screw up, to just nailing your references and focusing on minimizing minor slides/tire scrub.  


It's a real cool/fun process, but I feel like so many track tutorials are just ""Look at me bang out this fast lap"" done.  But there's no discourse or a lot of details on how to get there if you're 2s off pace.  I know I found that a bit more frustrating when I was learning, and now I'm usually fighting top 5 in split 1, which is great, but even still there's so much to perfect and learn."
"He usually makes a note those guides aren't for hot laps, rather how to get around safely and building pace from there."
"Good feedback!  If I try to do more, I'll need a bit more structure to the layout and more time for editing.  This last one I threw up quickly to help someone out, but I definitely think a bit higher quality and a slightly deeper dive would be great.  I appreciate it."
"That's a really good point. For summit t1, you can see I am super aggressive on the downshifts there because it helps you get more rotation, similar to adding rear brake bias (which you can't in fixed mazda).

But that's a great point to bring up."
"Yes, that's true. It's partially why I start with his track guides and not one of the hot lapper's videos."

Along with the video link posted in another comment (Suellio has amazing videos btw) mess around with AI races to help learn.
The sporting code has everything you needed to get started 
YouTube.
"Driver61 has probably the best course online with all the basics to racing cars (real or simulated)

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAZL0MKQigFNSY0BTdt_GsDwxdHoeJ302&si=Bb_91XCyWJ01UlwI"
"People say sporting code, and yes that is good for rules. BUT the iRacing.com driving school is more important. If you watch the videos through the member site you get a nifty achievement. Here is the YouTube links if you’re not an achievement hunter:

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqZLBOpI5JFKebBA_i-SCkGRRypXovWv6&si=TSwCVLaw9fKO_ak5"
Easiest way is have someone walk you thru it a couple times over discord chat. At least the basics to get going as it can be a little overwhelming. I can spot a race for you and talk you thru each stage and qualy or just turn a few laps and give you some basics
"iRacing has an entire playlist of videos for rookies about racing, driving, and understanding the car."
Hello Mark Martin
"Yup, that happens sometimes

https://preview.redd.it/al3k2yfan9dc1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f260a1322ed2dccda59afeed28e6280ce8a65a0"
I won a race like this... he just ... just quit. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
"Don't feel bad, one of the best sim racing YouTubers did that in his video today (Dave Cam)"
I always drive an extra lap back to the pits. You might’ve gotten reminded that the race wasn’t over
"I was done once upon time this when I was on P1. I never felt myself so stupid before.

I hide iRacing flags under Racelab but use Racelab's flags."
"I did this recently too. Couldn't figure out why everyone was racing back to the pits. Didn't figure it out until I got out of the car the race wasn't 10 laps, but rather 15 minutes 🤦‍♂️"
"Join the club, most of us have done the same. I did it while leading by 30 seconds…"
Nice to know that  Mark Martin is on iracing 😂😂😂😂
Until the spotter tells you to keep training for the next race there is no stop 😎
"Ouch. If it makes you feel any better, I did this IRL at the local county fair dirt track ATV race. Although I was like 5 at the time. But I was winning! After that I just remember being really confused, crying, and not racing anything again until like 30 years later when I started getting into karting."
"Dude, My first time doing good at  Nürburgring, I caught this guy in the last straight. Normally that race is decided by the end of the first lap. I stuck with it and took the lead. I then hit the right hander after the pit entry and stopped. Just a few feet from the finish line.   
It happens, always take Tiger Woods's advice. Never think you are done when you reach the finish, play through it hard as you can."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PiOcj8z38c&ab_channel=jrfan07
I was using kapps and switched to racelabs for this very reason lol😂 needed to make the racelabs flag huge and directly in the center of my screen
"Did the same thing two days ago, only I managed to work out it wasn't the last lap in time and rejoined after nearly getting out of the car. It was after a good race too. Lost 5 places and about 40 rating for not paying attention."
It happens to the second best of us...
K
Uh.... push the register button and move on??
"Yeah, been there done that 😅"
You're not the only one. I've done it at least once before that I can remember.
"My first oval race with cautions we got a yellow flag on lap 22/30, I was in P1 and asked P2 if we needed to pit and he said no. Shortly after every single car behind me pits and I lose the race 🤣

He ended up winning but his next 3 races he crashed out of everyone 👍🏼 

If you feel bad just think of me"
I was in a race leading and the guy in 2nd slowed and told me good race coming to the white flag a few days ago lol
I almost always end up driving an extra lap because I'm worried about this.
That's why I have my room Lifx light matching the race status!
"I saw this last night in one of mine, I passed him. Rough"
"Yea, I once gave up P3 because I thought the race was over, ended up in P17 🫠"
"Not quite the same situation but I completely misjudged where the finish line was at SPA two nights ago.  I had a pretty clean race but spun out on the very turn, and in my scramble to rejoin the track I cut the corner.  I had to take a .5 penalty so I just kind of coasted to the finish without getting on the gas.  Only problem was I completely misjudged where the line was and just barely got over it before a car crashed into me. I think that car may have actually been on their lap (1/2 a car length from the line). 

I felt like such an ass."
"To be fair, the dumbest thing would’ve been if you locked the brakes up just after the start/finish line. Which is already a really dumb thing some people do (Safety Rating still counts!), but if you already had that bad habit and did it a lap before the end of the race? Phew, that would’ve not been well received! 😂"
Only have to make this mistake once.
We all have done it and it's a mistake you only make once
"I did this two weeks ago at Daytona Road Course and still won the race (hadn't raced in long time and irating which is usually over 2k tanked when I came back so it was like 1kish race so nothing really to brag about I guess)

first replay I save in a long time"
"I always thought this was just a streamer thing. Personally, I avoid this by never lifting until I hear the spotter say I've taken the checkered. I feel like I won't get confused about the audio call the way I might about a flag indicator in the corner of my screen."
"I did something similar once, slowed down at an oval race while leading... could only finish P3, lol"
Aleix Espargaro has entered the chat
"Reminds me of the Malone clip

https://www.twitch.tv/mattmalone/clip/InquisitiveRenownedDogFailFish?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time"
I registered for a race today and then forgot. Lost 140 IRATING.
"Did this once in a dirt race. Was running P2, then started rubbing it in my teammate's face on discord since I was beating him (which I almost NEVER do on dirt) when I thought the race was over. He and 4 other cars drove past me so I finished a measly p6 and he had the last laugh. Instant karma has a way of getting me more often than I'd like..."
"If you learn something in a race, you didn’t lose."
"If it makes you feel any better, you made the day of the guy behind you"
"I did this at spar with the old pits final lap i just parked it at t1 got out the car, finish line is after t1"
"I did a similar thing a couple times in RX, leaving right before the second heat race, having forgotten about it :D"
"I've done the same once, because I was directly in front of the leader about to go a lap down so lost count."
Ferrari strats
i've done it TWICE. yes i am that stupid.
"In Germany we can say: ""you did the Peter move"" :D Insider of a German Youtube Group. Did the same in several games F1 and Forza :D"
"Once in my Gran Turismo days I was running second, and the leader did a handbrake turn across the finish line in celebration. But there was still one lap to go :)"
That's why nobody uses a flag for the last lap except for americans.
"I keep racing untill the spotter says ""good job, veeery good job"" (after withnessing me starting from pole and arriving 4th after a faster car fuck up 🙂)"
"I did this once as a lappie.

Turns out I had JUST passed the leader on the front stretch before he drew a checkered.

I pulled over and everything before noticed I got a ""cut the track"" penalty, sat and stared at it for THIRTY SECONDS like ""wtf?"" before I realized my meters were still running and I was still on my final lap.

Gained 3 positions though from people who wrecked out to DNF haha"
Aleix Espargaro?? Is that you?
"Dave Cameron did this today!! LOL

It happens to the best of us!"
"Had a friend do this in a race. He was second or third, and I see him parked on the last lap. I was very confused as was he. In his defense it was probably 3-5 in the morning for him"
I recently did the same thing
Bro why do us Mark Martin fans always have to catch strays like this?!
I see a few people saying Mark Martin. I googled the name and first result is Mark Martin (Murderer/Serial Killer here in the UK). Going to guess it’s not to do with him!
Aleix Espargo did so in motogp last year costing him a podium and IIRC would have been Aprilia’s best finish all year.
Look man. It’s still too soon.
Padme Portman. Hottest human being to ever exist
could have run out of fuel? i know ive done it before
Literally had this happen earlier. Final lap and he just disappeared from the lead. Ended up getting pole lmaooo
At least he quickly realized his mistake and recovered. Pretty funny though. Just goes to show it will happen to everybody at least once.
"I do the same, except at Nurburgring. You get a little extra Safety Rating doing this; unless you’re the very last person to cross the line."
"I did it at Daytona Road Course two weeks ago, came to a stop, figured it out and still won"
"Thanks, this makes me feel a bit better haha"
And me.
"Hilariously, my mouse flashes on and off white rapidly when its the finish. Was just too focused on the last few corners as the guy ahead made a slight error."
"It stings but still makes me chuckle every time when I think of his interview after 😂

“I can’t believe anyone else can be THAT stupid” when hearing he’s the second to pull off track while leading the last lap lol"
"Hahaha, definitely not that Mark! He's talking about the [NASCAR driver Mark Martin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Martin) He's often considered one of (if not the) greatest NASCAR drivers to never win the championship. He's brought up in this instance because during the [1994 Goody's 250](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PiOcj8z38c) at Bristol Motor Speedway, the race finished under caution, and he mistakenly thought that the second-to-last lap was the last lap, and he pitted from the lead thinking the race ended, which lost him the win and relegated him to 11th."
"*Excuse me sir, this is a Wendy's*"
Mkay
Usually don’t do burnouts when you run out of fuel lol.
Pole is when you qualify first just so ya know haha congrats on the W though‼️
"Wait do you actually get extra SR that way?? I only got this like a week ago but just kinda assumed that I could only hurt myself by doing the ""extra"" lap so I have been purposely not doing it"
He was talking about taking it in the bum lol
"Absolutely. The race goes until everyone disconnects or the last driver crosses the line, whichever comes first. (For example, after the leader crosses the finish line, if there was a lapped car who had crossed the line in front of the leader, their race won’t be over until they make it all the way around the track and cross the line themselves.) 

While the race is still going, even if you’ve finished the race, it’s still a hot racetrack. iRacing expects you to continue to treat it like a hot racetrack and thus the safety rating system is still in play. The easy way to tell is to look at the time remaining. When it ticks over to the 15 minute countdown (signifying the time before the server closes down), the track is no longer ‘active’. At that point, any incidents won’t count but corners also won’t count.

Generally the extra lap is always a good idea."
"If you have the F1 black box open the time remaining 'resets' when the race is officially finishes. I think it resets to 15 mins.

Everything up to this point counts towards your SR."
"The race is still active until the last driver crosses the finish line. This is why parking on the race surface is against the rules. 

On the black box there is a timer. Once it flips from 0:00 to 45m then to 15m, incidents no longer count. Until then, incidents and corners still count towards safety rating."
"Well thank you so much. I'm coming over from ACC and this last week racing MX-5s at laguna was my first stint in iracing. I'm already a pretty clean driver from racing on other games but it's nice to actually have to earn licenses here.

The extra SR would definitely help with that. I got my D license on road courses after like 7 races and now have 1500ish IR but immediately I'm the next race got taken out lap 1 by somebody behind me so looking for any way to keep my SR up at this point"
"If you have the F1 black box open the time remaining 'resets' when the race is officially finishes. I think it resets the timer to 15 mins.

Everything up to this point counts towards your SR."
Is this new?  I thought it was always 15 minutes after the race.
"I’m curious if those extra corners get counted if you don’t actually finish that lap. I don’t think it’s possible to finish that extra lap before the race ends. And I don’t know how the sim counts corners. If it’s every sector then it will help SR, but if it’s only by laps it can only hurt, if you get an off track driving back around."
"SR will go up and down, it happens. Just focus on driving cleanly and you’ll get there. As your iR continues to climb, you’ll end up in higher splits where you’ll *generally* find cleaner drivers."
"I can’t answer whether it’s “new” or used to be different. But the [sporting code](https://ir-core-sites.iracing.com/members/pdfs/20231205-official_sporting_code_dated_Dec_05_2023.pdf) currently reads:

*3.6.2. Incidents are counted throughout each session, including during the cool-down period after the checkered flag.
The cool-down period ends after all participants have either crossed the finish line or have left the session.*"
"Incidents are counted, but do we know if corners are? They might only count corners based on complete laps"
Corners still count. Both stop “counting” at the same time. Partial laps count.
"Maybe. I hope so. But it seems like iRacing calculates corners driven by how many corners are in a lap. Ovals count as four corners (short ovals used to count as 2, but now it's 4). Road courses go by how many total corners they have, that's why the ring is good for padding SR, because it has like 154 corners. 

My point is that the easiest way for the software to calculate your corners driven would be to simply multiply the number of corners in a lap by the number of laps driven. And you can't actually complete the lap after the checkered flag before the race officially ends. So I have my doubts that the corners driven after the checkered flag actually get counted"

"I was asking about the top split.  And I was confused about why there are multiple sessions all starting at different times and which one actually contained the top split.  It was quite a reasonable question, actually.

Before assuming someone is an idiot, you should ask yourself whether you misunderstood their question.

You should Google a famous case of this known as ""When does the 3 O'clock Parade start?"" It may improve your outlook on humanity."
"The way it’s worded. “Is there a channel that broadcasts top split” makes it sound like you are asking more about where the broadcast is and not about what top split it and time slots are. 

So maybe be more clear on your question wording."
And based on 2 of the 3 other responses. I’m not the only one who thought that was what you were asking. Only one person gave you the info you were looking for and I feel that was simply lucky that he happened to put that info in his comment. Not that he understood you were asking when the broadcast slot was.
So before telling me to reread your question. Why don’t YOU reread your own question to make sure you are clear on what information you are trying to ascertain
"They all answered my question.  I said where can I watch the top split - they said iRacing and racespot are broadcasting it.

You did not answer my question, you just called me an idiot and told me how to find iRacing's YouTube channel, which was both unhelpful and unresponsive to my question.

When you have a moment please let me know what time the 3 O'clock Parade starts."
"And now I'm actually not sure if YOU hold the same misunderstanding that I did.

The 24h race does not happen all at once.  There are 4 different sessions with different start times.  People that I follow on YouTube have all been starting at different times. Some of them were streaming their races when others hadn't started yet.

So I was trying to figure out when and where the top split is being held, and where I could watch it. I knew iRacing had coverage coming up but I didn't know if they were only going to be following the top split.  At first I was confused because I thought that the race had started many hours before iRacing's own coverage was scheduled to begin.

So yeah IMO it actually was a little tricky to figure all of this out but some kind people here explained it all to me."
"And what I’m saying is not once in your opening question did you write the word “when”. 

I understand how this shit all works. I’ve been here for 10 years and have done 6 Daytona 24s. 

I don’t see how anyone but one guy actually answered your actual question that we uncovered here in this comment thread. You were looking for “when” and everyone else answered with “where”"
">And what I’m saying is not once in your opening question did you write the word “when”.

I asked where to watch the top split. 3 people answered me with where to watch the top split.  One explained that I could watch it on iRacing's channel or on Racespot.  Another explained that I should not just ask where, but when (very helpful).  One person provided a link to the upcoming broadcast. Not the channel, the actual scheduled broadcast for the top split I was looking for.

You're the only person who for some reason thought I didn't know how to find iRacing's YouTube channel."
"So, you really need a brake pedal?"
"Just change ""circle"" to ""oval"" and these are exactly what I call them"

What does this post mean op? I'm new to oval.
ARCA is currently at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. They are and absolute blast around that circuit.
thanks!
"ARCA and gen 4 are the same car, used in (at least) two different series. He's just asking for clarification on that. "
"I was so excited for this combo, but participation is shit.  So disappointed.  Come on folks get out there."
"I ran a few practice sessions Wednesday and Thursday but was crimped on time to get a race in, but I’m free all weekend and I know what I’m racing. This car and this track match so well."
If the people who do this could read they would be very upset.
hOw CoUlD u HaVe AvOiDeD tHiS?
I got rear ended coming out of the bus stop last night and the guy had the nerve to blame me
I feel bad for whoever ends up with the lowest LMP2 split..
"![gif](giphy|RugihAZQpXsYD2towI)

Noticed this as well in 24h practice last night. I will protest any driver that does this and ruins our race for no reason."
Shouldn't have been on his track obviously
The amount of times I saw this happening in the Roar between LMP3's and GT4 (and presumably on TCR's as well) was ridiculous. There is absolutely no need to cut it that tight.
Leave enough room for netcode and the Holy Ghost.
"It’s really annoying they feel superior just because their class is faster, they you see them running wide on every turn"
Clearly you’re supposed to be on the other side of the double yellow
You only lose like 0.03 seconds going around a GT3.  It's stupid to cut it close.
"Target acquired 
/s

(Jk i wouldnt hit a dogbox driver)"
"His cries went unheard

*BAD END*"
This has happened to me 3 times in practices this week.
I just want to say thank you for not running a Porsche!
I hope you reported that guy because even in practice sporting code still applies
Could've landed a 787 dreamliner in between him and the car to his right. It's not hard to avoid people while driving  prototypes lol.
"It’s practice, it happens. Literally the whole point of the practice servers."
"dude just drove into the back of you. This is very deserving of a report, even if it was just in practice."
Love how they’ve been side drafting me all week not knowing I’ve never run IMSA or a GT3 before.  Very wise to squeeze me.
Im pretty sure the GTP guys dont want to ram people in the midle of the oval neither mate.
People need to learn how to lock it down when they get wrecked

"So, not that it makes it any better for your situation, but this is an issue with stupid/terrible drivers, not prototypes. Source: my team ran PLM and my sub-team that I was on (LMDh) had the _exact_ same thing happen…. on the straight… waaaaay outside of the braking zone. On like lap 10 or so. Dude ran straight into the back of us and had all the space in the world. Asleep at the wheel, I guess."
"Prototypes pass waaay too close at the best of times. unless we're two wide on the banking, go further up to pass us."
Should've just driven a GTP
Omg that response sent itching down my spine. 
lol 😂
"But it was your fault. You weren't in a GTP, and thus the main character of the race. /s"
"Had this happen as well, not in IMSA but in GT series. I was driving a GT1 and had an HPD rear end me and said I am obligated to stop before the bus stop and let faster traffic through and continue. 

P14 HPD, 1kIR, smashing into multiple 2.2k+ GT1s"
that and bottom split gtp
I had bottom split lmp2s in mine last year. I still have flashbacks and we were in the GTP.
It also fun watching their cars self heal
![gif](giphy|9rgeyXeLDuE7AQQOOh)
Obviously should have just retired and disconnected as soon as they saw him coming up behind
All the P3s were nearly chopping off the slower cars when passing in the oval. No idea why.
I see you also went to a dance at a religious private school!
"Oooo you've hit it perfectly, did lmp2 at hockenhiem a few weeks ago, I loved fighting for my position with 3 people that were in gtp's but couldn't understand how to brake without abs, they would fly past me on the straight then lockup and I'd pass them back, rinse repeat for 30 laps"
The Williams E-sports line is for gt3s only.
"I've been running the Audi all season. Its fast, but fragile (that first hit turned the car into a tripod, hence the spin). We're getting Bop'd just as hard though."
Clearly an inchident
"Yh and this will end up happening in the race and ruining several peoples races. 

Stop using ""oh it's just practice"" as an excuse"
">t want to ram people i

No one is saying its on purpose. They're just saying leave more room when you overtake on the oval."
Did I say they did? I'm saying cutting it as close as possible is how accidents happen. Whether by actual contact or netcode
"I was on the brakes after I hit the wall. I'm not gonna just magically stop; in fact it's why I turned my wheel so I'd hopefully go back up the track and away from traffic. Had I hejd my brake immediately I would have slid down into the Porsche. 

Moreover if you notice that hit collapsed my rear suspension on the side the lmp2 hit. The issues is clear here;  don't take unnecessary risks."
"yes I did move up slightly, not intentionally, and again if you are playing it that tight I needed to be perfect and not move up at all. Even then its possible to just get netcode and I die anyway. It feels so unnecessary when there so much more space up top."
You can’t even say that honestly
I believe you are being down voted for your poor attitude and being contradictory when called out.
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"It’s a learning moment for you, you’ll be alright tho

Buddy got everyone to hate him, got himself banned, and blocked me for it 😭😭😭😭"
Ngl this be the main reason I drive top class everywhere yall be getting massacred
"I loathe this attitude on iRacing. Or the dudes who lose their shit because they’re “stuck” behind a slower car (and I’m not talking about multiclass, I’m talking about dudes who feel like they’re 3 tenths faster which means you should just pull over and slow down and let them by instead of, I dunno… passing?)

I don’t know who started the rumor that whoever can set the fastest hotlap is the rightful winner of the race and everyone else is just in the way but uh… it probably should stop."
Sounds like my regular IMSA experience. Been wrecked out of the class lead multiple times. All by back marker gtps
Oh my gosh for the Roar 24 I was in the GT4 class and we happened to be with the bottom split LMP cars… only 8 of the 25 made it the full 2.4 hours. Traumatizing scenes
That might be all GTPs this year
Not only am I laughing at the comment but your username and I’m thinking “no one punts Jesus like Gaston”
"🤣 yes, yes I forgot"
"Yeah i am also running the audi, easily my favourite gt3 to drive. Bop is ridiculous but still managing to get same times"
Yes exactly. 100% bad driving from the GTP.
"I can, honestly. But it soooo little it doesn’t matter.
GTP fucked up."
"I’m not contradictory.
I’m pointing out the only little detail I can find.
But yet again, this sub is 99% people who are ubsure how to race."
[removed]
"I ran LMP3 in the Roar, won my split, started 12th, made 0 on track passes."
"I was in that split, too. 1.5 SoF for the GT4s and not even 1100 for those LMPs. I watched an LMP go to the apron on lap two, then abruptly turn up the oval directly into the side of a GT. Both cars destroyed completely."
I don't think so. IMSA enduro still had two splits of just gt3s on the Saturday
yeah depending on track temp I'm up to mid-high 44s
Literally cannot honestly say that but okay.
There you go 😎
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"Nice im getting roughly the same low to mid 44s, my team mate is getting 43s which is crazy to me on a full tank"
"Why not?
It literally a small thing. The GT3 did sbsolutely nothing wrong but that’s the only little thing and it’s miniscule."
my optimal is a 43.7 doubt I'll hit that. In the day I'm so slow.
"I mean I wasn't  going to say this originally  but it's kinda gross how every time multiclass incidents come up we hyper analyze the slower car. When it's the faster cars job to pass safely. Instead of giving advice for the lmp2/3/GTP driver we are telling gt3s ""if you drive perfectly, maybe you won't get hit."" 

This puts the onus on gt3s all having to be model drivers rather than addressing what makes faster class drivers make these poor decisions."
"Jesus fucking christ this sub ans playing the victim.

As I said; If i need to say ANYTHING about the GT3 then it is that you moved a tiiiiiny bit but it’s so small it doesn’t fucking matter.
The GTP fucked up and it’s all on that car."
If it didn't matter why point it out. Moreover all I did was point out how heavily policing the slower class doesn't help the faster class drivers who might be new learn.
"If that is the only thing you could say, and it doesn't even matter, did you really need to say it in the first place?"
"Yeah I think you’re learning that you didn’t need to say anything, and no, the GT3 didn’t."
If it doesn’t matter why are you still bleating on about it?
"GTPs are just the next generation of DPi which start life as one of the LMP2 chassis and then get a custom engine, spec hybrid and manufacturer styling/aero.

The chassis suppliers are the same 4 in LMP2 Dallara, Ligier, Multimatic and Oreca. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMDh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMDh)

IRL LMP2 had to be slowed down even to create additional separation."
"They're definitely closer than most people think IRL. LMP2 is heavily restricted, or it would actually have a faster top end speed. "
Looking at results. Last year was about 6secs in qualy. But only 4secs for fastest lap during the race. But not sure how the conditions were during either qualy or race
"Yeah and IRL it’s pretty close if you look at the numbers. GTP is heavier, but more torque and top speed. So the infield is a full wash, and the LMP2 can navigate the bus stop a little faster as well, but the GTP should be able to pull away on the two banks."
"They are about as close IRL too. The problem is that the LMP2 design was made when the top class they were racing alongside with (LMP1) had 2-300 more horsepower, and weighed 150 kg less, and had a bit more downforce than a GTP.

But the new top class got a lot slower, and even with taking away loads of horsepower, ballasting them up and restricting their aero, it's hard to make an LMP2 go slow enough. At the very start of the Hypercar class in WEC they were struggling to be faster than the LMP2s at times."
I’m working at the roar right now and in practice theres about a 5sec difference in pace.
"If a paint for a car or firesuit are set as a team paint, it will override individual paints anytime that team participates in a team session. The team owner is the one who sets team paints."
That’s what I thought but wanted to make sure since I’m running on a separate team
I’d definitely be slowing you down because I have a 1.4k iRating with a C license but if you’re okay with that I would be willing because I also live in the western US so we would be on similar time zones
"Still looking for someone to drive with, i could be down!"
Yes
Yes. In a team event you can withdrawal from the session by choosing forfeit in the ui. The way u join back is by going to ur team page and clicking race again.
"Okay, I was afraid the forfeit would not let me back in."
For team sessions you can always re-register with the team. 
"When you close iRacing. Are you selecting ""quit"" and going that route? Or are you just closing the window"
"in the actual sim, i quit correctly every single time, and in the ui i use the cross, which i assume must be the right way"
"Thank god it ignores FIA rules, if you think the racing is bad now imagine how bad it would be if you could shove people off the track intentionally even more"
Let's see some replays.
"The FIA is not the governing body of iRacing. 

iRacing is the governing body of iRacing. 

Hope that helps."
"Contrary to real life iRacing rules are made to have competition as close as possible. No one would play if it was like current F1, in which you can pretty much force someone to go offtrack without any consequence."
"Firstly, iRacing is not a FIA-based simulator. You're forgetting that this sim has NASCAR, IndyCar, IMSA, World of Outlaws, rally, and many other forms of motorsport not officiated by the FIA in one package. And secondly, do we really want to be racing with FIA regulations? I don't want to lightly door bang another car and be given a 5 second time penalty for it."
I doubt the FIA has anything about “owning a apex” or “owning a Racing line”
"Ok bye 👋

iRacing isn't governed by the FIA so FIA rules do not apply. "
"It's ok that you don't like iRacing, just go back to using LFM, nobody minds if you do."
"a computer game doesn't apply some non-specific rules from a real-world motorsport governing body rulebook?

ok. cool."
This sounds like the kind of guy who dives into the vortex of danger and then rages in voice chat.
This is not an airport
All of my protests have been successful during the 8 years I've been on the service. You are obviously protesting racing incidents and not egregious rule violations.
The official F1 games don't even follow the FIA's rules for racing when it comes to wheel to wheel stuff
The FIA doesn't control iRacing or even all of racing in general. They aren't the official embodiment of motorsport. So iRacing doesn't have to follow their guidelines.
"iRacing  has its own rules, just like the FIA, IMSA, NASCAR, SCCA has theirs.

iRacing has its roots in US based racing. Its rules are therefore more similar to US based racing series, than FIA rules. 

To me, this is a great, as FIA rules (or rule interpretations) are stupid beyond belief  for most common racing situations."
Offtopic but this thread reminds me of how miserable it is to talk about racing with people that only watch F1.
I'm glad posts like these are made so that people find out that FIA regs do not apply here
"First, it’s a game. And second, it sounds like you’re a newbie and should work on your own awareness and worry less about whether others are following some made-up rules. Reporting is for intentional wrecks or really egregious stupidity like divebombing from a mile back."
"I love iracing but you are right, we could do with a better report system than just ‘intentional wrecking’
That should need a re-write of the sporting code and probably more staff at iracing though.
I think iracing could benefit from that as really aggressive drivers who break regular racing rules are not punished more often than not atm.
But I think this Reddit sub isn’t the place to discus that, any post even remotely negative towards iracing gets downvoted to oblivion.
As will mine."

"Good, F1 “owning the corner” rules suck"
[deleted]
"For F1 they have some pretty awful guidelines that do give cars full ownership to a corner and the other drivers just need to disappear. 

Unfortunately people see those guidelines and think they apply to iRacing"
[deleted]
"yeah, no rules! now I start to like it more....."
Anyone who talks about owning an apex or owning a racing line is a great danger to those racing around them.
"Verstappen does this in iracing all the time, minus much voice abuse"
[deleted]
can post a link to those rules? (iracing) because as I said there nothing much there
"yeah I'm proud newbie, I care about my own awareness and would like to enjoy fair play"
"thanks bro, you give me a little hope for the humanity <3"
"In my two reports, neither were malicious but both were successful."
"I thought you can protest ANY part of the sporting code?

i.e. even the ""no respect"" part ;P"
Maybe you should have included them in the first place.
That’s because F1 rules are a mess. You can run a driver off the track and it’ll be fine one race but the next it’s not allowed (which it shouldn’t be)
"Here is an official document from 2022 season: [https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc\_2\_-\_2022\_imola\_event\_-\_fia\_f1\_driving\_standard\_guidelines.pdf](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf)

And it's not awful that drivers can't divebomb from nowhere and claim that they should have space in the corner because they have 2cm of front wing alongside the other car.

As to why F1 has different rules that most other series, my guess is that there are 2 reasons:

1) Cars are much faster in corners, so it's a lot more difficult to adapt your trajectory to a late move

2) Side visibility is shit in F1 cars. You can't leave space to a car you can't see."
You know there isn’t just a rule book called the “FIA rulebook” every series runs them differently. But still there’s not gonna be rules like “owning an apex or racing line” in most series rules.
Ok you try that and see how long you last. 
"""I owned the apex!""

- Guy in garage with 25 minutes of repairs."
"Verstappen's driving style shows a history of forcing the other driver to back off or crash.  


I also don't think anyone wants to be on the team that takes him out of the race, regardless of whose fault the collision is.  


I bet he gets away with it (with a good result for him) much more often than others might because of these and other factors. "
Press F to doubt
Fair play is getting out of the rookies before you complain about driver skill.
[deleted]
"aaactually....

There is a very basic ""FIA rulebook""

Esp. [Appendix L](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/appendix_l_2024_publie_le_01_janvier_2024.pdf) of the International Sporting Code ;-)"
"ok, im not saying what to follow im saying there no rules to make any judgement what is allowed what is not"
what you mean? iracing still operating with no issue
"I like how you get upvotes for expanding on my comment and I’m down voted lol. This sub is funny. He definitely will throw his car in and “claim” an apex forcing others off and making them back out like you said. Has a history of it in various sims, most famously a bunch of times running lemans in rfsctor (I believe). But yea +1 on your remarks. Fully agree"
I’ll gladly be in the team that takes that fuck out. Maybe he’ll grow up a little and stop acting like an entitled baby. We all saw what he did at Spa. He won’t but you can hope
"road: D, 2.75sr. But I do not think that make any difference for you"
"No it's not some red bull conspiracy.  The FIA put out guidelines that basically say if you're on the inside with a significant amount of overlap, then the overtaken driver must give room for the attacking driver (and essentially cede the corner as you no longer have rights to defend)

Normal racing doesn't have these kinds if rules. They're exclusive to F1. "
"Here is maybe what they are talking about:

[https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc\_2\_-\_2022\_imola\_event\_-\_fia\_f1\_driving\_standard\_guidelines.pdf](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf)"
TBF that’s more for Series and tracks than drivers.
"Because it’s not a real person controlling pens. There’s not loads of people watching every single split 24/7 to give pens. 

The service cant do no fault incident points. It’ll never be able to do giving pens out based on who’s at fault because it’s never black and white."
"""always leave a the space"" will help you along nicely. That's it, that's the guideline you're looking for."
You've got to express disappointment that it works for him!
"Congrats, you've played the game for 3 days"
That’s a pretty low safety rating. Work on your awareness before you start trying to blame others. Know when to back out of passes and when to let aggressive drivers pass (they’ll wreck themselves if you stay in their mirrors).
[deleted]
"I think the main problem is that ""significant overlap"" is rather vague, and not consistently enforced. 

Say you would instead clarify that by saying, for example, front wheels in line with rear wheels at turn in point, then we would not have any more ambiguity. 

It would also mean you're not allowed to do stupid dive bombs where you throw the car into the vortex of danger. But, you can still fight before that and try to outbrake your opponent. 

Now, I could misremember things but I do believe  Iracing has some old video where this is actually the recommended approach. Not saying it's by the book, but rather strongly suggested. 

I could be wrong as I've looked for the video and haven't found it."
[deleted]
lol. He def goes off rules like that. Irscing seems more if any part of your car is there you both need to leave room. Max gets a nose ahead and runs as wide as he wants cause it’s his corner. I haven’t a clue what the “rules” say for that though
"The nascar rules definitely do not say that, nor does Indycar which is pretty much all oval racing."
"Here you have your answer on the ""significant portion"":

[https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc\_2\_-\_2022\_imola\_event\_-\_fia\_f1\_driving\_standard\_guidelines.pdf](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/doc_2_-_2022_imola_event_-_fia_f1_driving_standard_guidelines.pdf)"
But adding rules wouldn’t solve the issue. There’s multiple problems at hand. Netcode and not every incident is black and white. How would the code differentiate between not giving enough room and a move that would never work.
"A collision at that point would be a racing incident so there's nobody at fault but who wants to end their race in a crash? It's a risky/bully move. 

Setting up pressure and passing when a mistake is made by the lead car would be the safer/sporting thing to do."
I’m not even close to the fastest lmp3 so take this with a grain of salt. I’m not sure what the faster dudes do. But I have just been tailing yall until a gt4 gives ample room then I will scoot by. If nothing ever opens up I just fly past on the straight once we are down the hill. Yall are in a race too not going to push you out just to make up a few seconds 🤷‍♂️
"If the LMP3 is smart they'll just chill and wait to pass you down the straight into The Chase. They aren't that much faster coming down the mountain, especially since Forrests Elbow is an adventure without ABS. That said, I'm sure not every LMP3 is smart 

If you really want to let them by you could swing to the left in that little straight before the turn into Forrests Elbow. Not exactly predictable, but it's probably the safest place to let them by if they're being super aggressive."
"I’d say for over the mountain it’s a hard place to be. Expect to be left on the approach to skyline, to allow an overtake into skyline from the right.
Let cars through after the exit of the cutting on the inside, and if a P3 can get alongside you before the left hander towards skyline allow it is my gut feel. I doubt there’s enough room between the dipper and forests elbow.

Take this with a grain, but as a regular LMP2 driver and also a Bathurst enjoyer, that’s where I would have though passes could be facilitated in multiclass racing"
Clench your butthole and pray. It seems most prototype drivers are the most impatient lot in iRacing.
"So the rule of thumb is that it's on the faster class to pass safely, ans on the car being passed to stay in their lane, that way their actions are predictable. It's generally slower cars trying to move out of the way, and the faster car not being able to anticipate, or having gome to react to it as it wasn't something they expected that leads to incidents."
Your only responsibility in a “blue flag” situation is to hold your line and enable as safe of a pass as possible. You don’t have to slow down or move way over to “make space” for them. It’s ultimately their responsibility to pass you. The long straights at Bathurst are the ideal place for that to happen because they’ll be much quicker through those sections and there’s plenty of room.
"Just make it really obvious what your intention is. If you're gonna hold your racing line, be right on it, and drive on your normal pace. If you're gonna give them one side of the track, move fast and early to the other side. The worst thing you can do is sit your car in the middle of the track, or make a half attempt at the apex, and make the LMP3 guess."
"There are three sections that are very long they can pass safely on. They need to cool down a little until they reach one. The uphill bit after the tight left hander and the down hill part after the quick chicane are too narrow for safe passing and if they decide to pass there then its really on them if they crash out.

Just drive your race and don't defend when they are on your tail."
"Honestly, you don't have to do anything.  Stay on your line and drive.  

The lmp3s will get around you when they can.  I know there are some idiots that will attempt risky moves and believe the slower car should move out of their way, but it's the paasing cars responsibility to do it safely."
Hope and Pray
"Don’t. That’s how. 

I mean definitely don’t block or frankly even defend but like… that’s their job. Your job is to race your race. 

They’re much faster, they’ll get around just fine. If they aren’t capable of passing you without you going off of your line (in a much faster car), then they don’t deserve to pass you until the straights. It’s that simple."
You don't. Drive your line and let them find their way round. They are faster in every single way. It's the nature of multi class.
"Run your line. If they try a move in a less conventional spot, just let off and let them clear you before the apex, that way you can still hit it and lose the least amount of time."
Everywhere is a good place to pass at Bathurst said just about everyone. This is why I will not race there.
"You are doing your part by being predictable. The responsibility of making a safe overtake lands on the faster car. Stay on your line an let them work out how to overtake you. 
UNLESS you are able to tell the driver behind that you are going wide in the next corner."
"There're a couple of spots with two of the kinks (turns 5 and 8 on the wiki track map) you can take a wider line through to open up the apex for the lmps and then that gives you the racing line into the next corners, BUT, it's always situationally dependant. 

The lmps can't be already on your rear bumper all you can do is stick to the racing line and be predictable. If they're a little bit behind, think 0.2-0.3 behind and they can get a run on you, you can open the door for them with enough time for them to understand your intent, but if there's more than 2 close together or you're in a close battle with other gt4s it gets messy and all you can do is your best to not trip over each other.

Once you hit skyline, there shouldn't be any passing until conrod, you can overtake at Forests elbow but it's very easy to lock it up into that corner. Just be wary of turn 19 (the slight left kink onto Conrod). Look for which side the lmp goes, if they go to the left side you'll need to take a wider line on the right through it, if they go right side, you'll need to hug the left hand side.

The rule of thumb is always stay on the racing line, be predictable and let them overtake you. BUT, be very careful when the racing line changes sides of the track. If the faster class commits to the side the racing line will move to, don't follow the racing line until they have passed you. Seen waaaay to many incidents from slower classes abruptly pulling in front of a faster class because they're blindly following the racing line."
This seems to be a rare mindset.
Are you sure you should be driving a prototype? This attitude feels out of place.
You are the chosen one. The one who is to bring balance to the force…
"I do the same. From the exit of cutting to forest elbow, there's just not much space to get it done. I think I've passed exiting the cutting a few times."
Can you come race IMSA please? Maybe coach there GTPs while you're at it?
"Yeah this is my mindset. I see the other LMP3s are more aggressive at passing the slower class, but I usually make up a few more places from those same kind of drivers crashing out."
please clone yourself
"That's more or less how its gone in the two races I've done this week. Getting passed at the left hander before Skyline (McPhillamy Park?) is safe if the GT4 is ready for the pass, but it costs a lot of time. LMP3s can definitely make a move between The Dipper and Forrest's Elbow if they're desperate. I had to hug the left side of the track and take a super narrow approach to Forrest's Elbow when two LMP3s fighting for position forced the issue."
"Yup, I just stay predictable and watch my mirror. If they try a dumb pass, I let off the gas and let them by just enough to get back on the ideal line for the next corner entry. So far, it’s been surprisingly chill and mostly everyone has waited for the straights to pass. Kudos to LMP3 in my sessions this week. I thought it would be a wreckfest."
So pretty much hold my line and be ready if they try anything stupid?
"Sure, the rules say you don’t have to let anyone by, but if you’re trying to make sure an lmp3 doesn’t get desperate and take the both of you out, it’s still wise to assist a pass before that happens."
"I’m a big believer in the to finish first, first you have to finish. I’m not eating a wall taking a sketch pass on a gt4. I don’t wanna ruin their race and I sure as fuck don’t wanna end mine 😂"
That’s the plan eventually. Going to do LMDh in IMSA series and the c8.r gte class next season unless iRacing gets that shiny new z06 gt3.r in here by then. if we do get the new vette I honestly might be all in on gt3 next season in which case I’ll be yelling at them too 😂
"Yeah the thing with the run to Forrest’s elbow is that it’s a zig-zag approach, and then the braking zone is super sketchy which is why I thought it wouldn’t be a great place to make a move - too high risk compared to the others I’ve mentioned. 
Doesn’t  mean people wont try a stupid move. 

Would have thought that you wouldn’t lose too much time into skyline, maybe a tenth or 2 for both parties having to lift slightly earlier.

If any track was to try and teach communication through body language, lapping over the mountain is probably the highest up there. Both as the fast and slow class, if you treat it like Nords, as a give and take section, you’ll likely come out unscathed"
"Hold your line, and be assertive about it. There are a couple spots over the top that are available so if you’re comfortable you can stick to the inside and LMP3’s should be able to get by. I try to run close and I’ll go by on the inside under the bridge before the dipper."
As in real life multi class racing - the onus is on the passing car. In saying that I still try to make life a little easy for them especially if they are defending.
"Maybe; but there's a balance here. You don't need to sacrifice your race for a faster LMP3. Some will expect that and, frankly, they need to learn a bit more about multiclass racing and how it actually works. You absolutely do not nor should you do things that significantly compromise your pace. You have exactly as much right to the track as any other participant.  


I'm not saying ""Don't let people by"", I'm saying that letting people by doesn't need to mean going way off-line and slowing down, like some people expect."
Please teach the other LMP3 drivers your wisdom
"You tell that to the GTP's being heroes into the bus stop..

They are so eager to pass immediately. Like i've got every right to take the apex and not have to jump out of the way to suit you..

Have some patience people."
I have noticed a lot of that in iRacing in general of people think they deserve the whole track if they are even slightly faster and act like other cars dint exsist. But yeah the multi class faster class can bring some arse wholes out
Maybe his hat flew out and he was going back to retrieve it.
"this is why people need clutch pedals or something bound to clutch. You can easily 180 any car if you toggle TC off and dump the clutch. But you see time and time and time again people buy a two pedal set because ""I never use the clutch"""
"He also could have dropped his coffee out the window, you gotta look for it yaknow"
"tbh in most cars you can still do the same by just shifting down to neutral, flooring it, and flipping back to first."
"I use a clutch and love being able to get little tricks like that in, the TC bit is a good tip, I just started to race with TC cars and havent even thought of this"
"Yeah most of them have a toggle that will automatically turn back on after a bit, or the pit limiter will also disable tc on a lot of cars"
"Did the same but to 5th, best bit was my 2.51 SR increase haha. Looking forward to IMSA around here next week 😬"
haha yeah me too.  GTPs at Nords is going to be something else.  They struggle enough to keep it clean at Daytona.
Should be able to get a good finish in the 2:40h l just by staying on track I think haha
Some older drivers have not created a new forms account.
"What you could do is look them up in the UI, follow them, if they're online and in a practice session, join it and send a private message there."
it's real backward step not being able to contact fellow racers.
"Yeah, I accidentally bumped a guy in one of last night's Gen 4 Talladega races towards the end. The yellow dropped & the car in front of him checked up causing an accordion effect. I felt bad but couldn't text him afterwards due to him leaving the post race chat. Odd thing was I thought I'd barely tapped him, because I had no front end damage, but I looked at the replay and he had back bumper damage. I'm not sure what else I could've done. It was one of those bang bang plays where yellow drops and wham."
So... is impossible to message them?
" Thanks for the idea, that's just what I'm going to do"
"Basically, yeah"
"They can hide their online status btw, but people rarely do that."
"Yes, I just chatted with support from the web (I just found out that it is possible) and they told me the same thing. Thanks for the info! :)"
"something something F1 liveries, something something avoidable if you didn't have your driving line on something something use your brakes

Bad luck man. I will never understand why people refuse to lift for a slow car on that straight and just opt to drive into each other. It's the second weirdest phenomenon at Spa"
OP does lift. You can hear it (at nearly the same time as what sounds like a lighter strikes lol)....not like there was a ton of time to react.
"Whooosh

The comment about not lifting was more aimed at the guy in front of him that drove straight into the lead car. Not OP."
The doesnt make sense either....its a flat out section. The lead car just kinda drifts to the right after looking like they'll  stay more left.
"You and me are having two completely different conversations man. 

Im not talking about who’s at fault at all."
"I know, but i dont get your take even as a joke. It sucks for OP, but the lead car looks like they're on pace to me. I dont see a slow car..."
"What lead car are you looking at? I'm looking at the lead car that is so far off pace, he moves over frantically and intentionally blocks causing a 3 car crash at the start of the highest speed section of the track.

Which, by the way. Would have been avoided had the 2nd car simply lifted and not drove straight into the back of the lead car - not that it matters it looks like he got away unscathed at the cost of the lead car and OP"
"Except that car ISNT off pace. The middle car caught their slipstream, and op caught the slipstream of the middle car. I agree that the lead car panicks and moves to block though because they weren't anticipating both cars behind to get such a good run. But they were on pace. 

There was no need for either middle or OP to lift provided the lead car didn't panic block, and by the time they do lifting wouldn't have helped."
"[OpenKneeboard](https://openkneeboard.com/) *might* be able to help to pin a chat window to your view. I haven't tried that. Or you could have some TTS service set up to read out chat messages for you. You might miss a few chats because of the TTS interval, but realistically you are not reading every single message while driving anyway."
I think there’s a different endurance race this weekend…
True that. Was worth a shot tho !
"I should note, that there are no updates to install for the track or cars used in this race."
Completely close out of iRacing and start again??
"Tried that, didn't work"
"indy pro pm18 is a 10/10 car.

Also if you want a guarenteed big grid in these two lower participation series the big race is in one hour for the USF (9pm EST) and 2 hours for the Indy Pro (10pm EST) every Thursday. The two time slots swap around once the USA goes on daylight time.

edit: heres the discord all the Indy pro 2000 guys hang out in https://discord.gg/pDfGZqU6"
I got stuck in low split hell in the F4 after I had a couple hardware issues that bombed my iRating. I found it really hard to get consistent gains in F4 because it was such a mess in the lowest split so I switched to USF2000 and found it a lot cleaner and was finally able to recover my iR
I agree 200% just started usf2000 again after running f4/3 first months and i missed it. Its made me better at f4 as well since having my best spa races ever. Ive won 2 races today and they are clean and fun!
I did the same since the indycar partnership; and i like it more than F4/3. Both cars have cleaner races and more respectful drivers in general. Indy Pro is a treat to drive on the roads
I've been thinking about hitting up some Indy races.  Hopefully participation goes up with the license returning.
"I started my open wheel career with the formula renault 2.0, and moved to USF not too long after. Makes me happy seeing all these people talkin about the indy feeders 🥹"
You can also do both races back to back at a good cost effective rate since the USF2000 and Pro do the same track schedules. Plus ovals. 
"I have run the F4 for several months and the driving standards are beginning to wear on my nerves.  In 3 of my last 4 races I have been wrecked or taken out and had my race effectively ended inside of 2 laps through no fault of my own.  Not only has my iRating taken a hit but my SR got dumped as well:  I messed around with the USF2000 in the fall and it might be time to make the jump permanently.  I haven’t tried the PM18 yet, is it similar to the F3?  I have raced that some as well."
The indy pro car is the greatest car on the entire service besides the radical sr8 in my factual irrefutable opinion
"Here s the thing tho , tracks they run are not really my thing"
"I’m highly tempted to try the C class Indycar series  with the dallara 18, is it any good?"
I do not think the usf and f4 are the same chassis.  I haven't seen this info anywhere.  The USF and Indy pro are the same chassis with different engines and aero packages.  Tatuus makes all USF and indy pro chassis.  F4 has a variety of manufactures.
The best racing on the service. Hands down.
"Thanks for that!

Yeah; the Indy Pro is my FAVORITE car on the service. 

I forgot to mention that while these share a chassis with the F4/F3 cars; there’s no Halo or giant antenna!"
I have absolutely no idea why more people don’t drive this car. It’s so fucking good. I was hanging around in practice earlier to see if by some miracle I got a race but nope.
ever since they borked the 992 pcup the pm18 at nords is my favorite combo on this service
"Yeah absolutely. I think it’s a combination of not appealing to the lowest common denominator and again I think the rolling start, though it’s not what I personally prefer, does help a lot. (You start with warmer tires and don’t have as much of a speed differential at the first corner)"
"Yeah that’s kind of what I’m thinking!

I haven’t given the actual IndyCar a try yet, mostly because it’s at Nurburgring this week which sounds amazing; but I don’t know the ‘Ring well enough to race it in something that fast yet. 

Ovals next week in the Open Wheel C/D. That’ll be an adventure for me, as I’ve never done an oval race!"
Yep. And they’re alternate hours so you can do a D race and get up and refresh your beverage and dispose of your old beverage in the porcelain receptacle and then get a few laps in comfortably before starting the C race. There’s about a 30 minute gap going from D to C.
"The PM-18 is built by Tatuus and if I'm not mistaken is basically an upgraded F4 chassis. It's built to the F4 spec, more or less (but no Halo), but with more power. Whereas the USF2000 is nearly identical to the F4 car and sets nearly identical lap times.   


I have less experience with F3 than any of the four but in my experience, it's very F3-esque. If you like driving the F4 and F3 cars, you'll like driving the USF2000 and PM-18 cars, IMHO.  


Just finished racing both back to back and it was, again, an excellent experience. Couple of incidents behind me where someone spun out or didn't see someone. And folks were friendly and not too upset about it. And for the most part it was a very very clean race. Which has, again, very consistently been my experience."
"So there's two C class series. One that runs the PM-18 (which is an F4 chassis with a more powerful engine and some other tweaks), and the iR-18. I'd recommend both though my experience with the iR-18 is pretty limited. I \*believe\* the C class race in the iR-18 is Ovals only, if I'm not mistaken."
It’s my favorite series on the service. Absolutely love it.

"If you’re unsure about something because you haven’t already come across it naturally or nobody has taken the time to inform you, specifically; there’s a really really cool [website](https://www.google.com) where you can get more info about things like this. 

By the way, one of F4’s variety of manufacturers is… Tatuus. And when Indy wanted to move to a more modern monocoque chassis they contracted with Tatuus who took their existing F4 car and built both the USF2000 and IndyPro car by basically modifying the F4 car only in ways that it did not meet Indy standards. Both cars are in fact a variant of the FIA F4. Basically just with some reinforcement and a Mazda engine. 

Another way to find this information is just to uh… look at them. And see that they look almost identical."
"we've got 11 signups for the race in 12 mins, come race with us!"
"Fwiw, you can change settings to make the halo transparent"
"My theory is because it's a little too similar to the F3 but without the big name recognition of being attached to Formula 1. 

If you want to race definitely try 8pm and 10pm EST from Monday to Thursday. I can't promise they'll go official outside the the 10pm Thursday race but you show up at those times you'll find people."
"I suppose if it was a lot more popular it also wouldn’t be as good perhaps; I think F4’s popularity is its downfall. 

However that was definitely my reaction when I started. The car is amazing. The people who race in it are amazing. Why on earth aren’t more people doing it?"
"The regular IndyCar is like a heavier, slightly slower, but less snap-happy Super Formula."
"You absolutely have to go race the indycar, but yeah, nords isn't a good place to start, it's already a very tough car, and solely the speed can get overwhelming at nords, anything faster than GTs do that IMO. And 9 straight laps with conserving tyres is one hell of an ask if you're new to the car. I've done that race a few times now, it's most often not even half the field that makes it to the end, just so easy to have a huge shunt. Participation has been decent, I reckon it'll get better as we get more sensible tracks"
"Wait, Indy is at Nurburgring this week? Thanks for the tip. I know what I'm doing when I get home.
1. Adjusting my race filters.
2. Indy at Nurburgring."
Any suggestions for adjusting going from USF2000 to the IndyPro?
"Occasionally I'll catch one of my races someone uploaded/streamed on YouTube. ""I'm famous!"" More ""broadcasting"" coverage for the IndyPro though."
"From what I’ve seen they do road but it’s like 80% oval, which could be a nice change from roads but ig we’ll see!"
So they are not identical as you claim as you look it up for yourself here: [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com) instead of being a smart ass B on the internet you could be more precise in your language and communications.
I’ll catch you tomorrow for sure! I’m in the middle of cooking dinner atm!
Usf2000? Whats the league by chance?
You can and that helps but; I still prefer not having it at all!
Super Formula is a sadistic psychopath built by spiteful engineers who didn’t have the stomach to become serial killers so they designed a machine to do the job for them.
It is! There was some guy named Max that was doing it a bit and setting some impressive times. Hope he gets a chance to drive a real car someday.
Not really. The cars are pretty similar. The IndyPro has more power and a bit more grip. You’ll have to develop a feel for a throttle on corner exits to avoid wheel spin (which isn’t as much of a concern on the USF2000). I find them to be pretty similar when it comes to the overall feel and characteristics. So much so that I race both (they use the same tracks) and find that my marks are pretty darn similar.
"theres a b class series for the ir18 that just does mostly road too.  its kinda the opposite of the c class, and also open setup"
"I don’t think he said they were identical. He said they share the same chassis. And they do.

He said they *look* ALMOST identical. And… they certainly do that too."
"it's not a league, these are official races. However the communities are small and operate similar to a public league.

Find the official ""US Open Wheel D - USF 2000"" and ""US Open Wheel C - Indy Pro 2000"" series and join em, just like any other official series."
Its called US Open Wheel D 😂 the official series lol
"That is what I figured, thanks! It's been fun seeing my name in the iRacing forums for the USF2000 stats. Really a good motivator. I'll probably get the IndyPro as I already have the IR18. But that's probably headed for oval-centric for me so I can practice for the 500."
Pity the F3 wasn't working.
Do you also go on Nextdoor and tell “to the gray car that’s speeding SLOW DOWN”
It depends on if that damage caused the wreck. That could have been how they drive anyway if they are a bad driver.
lol
"I’m not a NextDoor user, but omg do people actually do that? That’s unhinged"
100% it’s unreal
"Yeah, the template is not symmetrical, do you have to account for this while working and draw on an angle to make it match up."
that’s rough
Shit happens and you can’t always get it right
Accidentally entered a PCUP race yesterday thinking it was a practice. Passed out like 15 min into the practice session. Woke up down 140 irating
I had no idea you could blow an engine on fast downshifts in the game. How do I check for engine damage? I usually shift quite fast from 3rd to 1st in the mx5 before a tight turn to avoid unsettling the car mid-turn.
"I hear you mate. Accidentally entered into a porsche gt3 race at nurburgring when I'd never done any gt3 before - thought it was a practice.

Stepped away to go to the toilet and when I came back qualy had started.

Wasn't a good day 🥺"
Average post on this sub. “I entered a race and DNF’d”
"Yeah, I'll be at it tomorrow though I just got 1600 irating before this so it makes it worse"
You have a very nice Reddit profile
"Engine damage means either you'll not accelerate as fast as usual or more likely the engine just goes from overrevving. 
But yeah mx5 doesn't have a downshift protection to stop you from overrevving. "
"You can't check the damage itself. Generally, if you are downshifting too early, the engine and oil temperature will skyrocket. You can check it pressing D. It's also relatively frequent with old, high-powered cars (like the Nissan GTP, these cars don't protect themselves of having the engine with super high revs) in Stop&Go tracks like Long Beach or Gilles Villenueve."
"Yes.

I was gonna post a video of me winning a race but I forgot to save the replay 😔"
Thank you sir
"We got a Senna here. 


While not explicitly outlawed, i believe it would be successfully protested under the following: 

8.1.1.5. Cutting the course

8.1.1.7. illegal Surfaces

8.1.1.9. Nefarious Tactics 

And the Catch All 2.1.4."
"Is bathurst actually quicker thought. It's such a tricky pit entry without offtracking. 
Personally I wouldn't do it but would protest someone doing it under competition issue and see what iracing says"
I actually do remember seeing this happen to basic Ollie at Bathurst a while back. Guy went into the pits to edge out the position over Ollie in the last lap.
"Yes, it’s against the sporting code and would be considered a nefarious tactic in order to gain an advantage. If someone is caught doing it intentionally (on the last lap of Silverstone for example), the protest will be successful and they will overturn the result and place that car in last. This happened in F3 last week and I received the standard protest reply of “Driver was notified of outcome” along with an updated pdf of the results showing them in last place."
You can't speed in the pits or you get a penalty. Never knew it could be faster at any track.
"Sporting code says getting towed at certain points in the track to give you an advantage is against the rules, but not sure on actually just driving in."
In qual it automatically invalidates your lap by giving you the furled black flag
Ollie deserves anything given to him. dude is a missile with no guidance system.
"Nice! I thought this would be the case, but I wasn't completely sure they wouldn't just say it was fair game."
"That's right. But there are a few tracks where it is faster even while following the pit speed limit. For example, this became an issue during a previous Bathurst endurance special event, when a top level driver pitted to get a huge advantage in qualifying and steal pole. Now iRacing has fixed that by making it so that if you pit during qualifying, your laps will not be scored until you reset the car (at least if quali scrutiny is set high enough)."
"I'd agree some of his moves are...aggressive, but clean. Haven't seen all his races, but haven't seen him take someone out. Can't leave the door open an inch around 5k racers"
"lol, really??"
Ollie is a content creator first... racer... maybe second. he knows what his GT sport audience likes and plays to that.
You certainly won't be able to run Max settings but you'll be fine
I’m able to run iRacing in VR on low/mid settings on a 1080Ti. So you’ll be golden.
"That's exactly what I use.  It depends on your processor as well but I run 90 fps at a mix of high/mid settings, the only exception I've found is Long Beach and Daytona at night I have to turn down the settings a little bit. 


Game looks great and the immersion is incredible. "

Are you trying to do this in a fixed series? You can’t turn traction control off in fixed series.
Same result in open series too
"As far as i know there are two option:  
""Racelab App"" with the Flatmap Overlay(easier to setup)  
or  
The Trackmap from ""Joel Real Timing""(my favorit, but it can be hard to configure)"
"I haven't heard of anything like that. There are so many unknown factors like you are. Other dryers having bad laps would be hard to predict accurately.
Have you thought of using a map overlay and just look at where cars are on the track?"
Couldn’t figure out Racelabs Flat Map and Post Pit Indicator but JRT is exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks a ton!
"AI hosted means race **you** can drive in a session which contains AI controlled cars. I'm pretty sure it works with leagues.

Your second paragraph is confusing to me a little. Are you asking if you can register in a session as an AI and then what, the AI will do a race on your behalf or something? That's not at all what AI racing is in iRacing."
"It means you can drive with other people as well as AI in a hosted session, that’s all there is to it."
Can’t believe those two red cars both managed to avoid you by the smallest of margins.
Honestly that was probably the best possible outcome from a crappy situation
"Great job holding it together! Use your mirrors! You should have seen him coming, either go defensive and close the inside (you left it open), or take the outside and let him by cause he’s going to pass you from the slow down of the first contact anyways. Very avoidable, fault on both ends."
"Solid chance this is an unpopular response, but here goes:

This is what rookies are for. This is a case where you need to understand that you need to communicate what you're doing to the car behind you. This is especially true on the first lap, and true any time you're on the last couple laps and the racing is close.

In this case, what you communicated to the car behind you is ""the inside lane is open."" That's probably not what you intended to communicate, and the move that the white and blue car may or may not have tried to make was certainly not on. But you're approaching a high-speed corner with a high difference between your two speeds getting there. It also looks like the white and blue car simply takes that corner quite a bit faster than you do -- another thing that rookies is good for sorting out.

From your perspective, you're simply taking the normal line, and he dive bombed you. From his perspective, you're taking a wide line, he's moving faster, and you cut off his nose.

To avoid incidents like this, it's a good idea to know where cars are around you, and to think ahead. I get that this is hard. I'm describing more advanced racecraft, and this is a rookie race. It's not something you should expect to have down. But it is a place where you have the ability to think ahead and by doing that, you can minimize the chances of something like this happening."
Rookie racing at its finest!  Good recovery!!
Epic save
Hell of a save
You did not need to brake more you brakedtoo much
Not talking about the crash but how in all hells you managed to save that? Awesome control!
"I am puzzled by this, Black and Purple are on a section of track that they are going full out. Their accelerators are mashed to the floor. They can go no faster. They have been floored long enough to have nearly maxed out their speed, and yet here comes white and green with all kinds of extra speed. He rammed them, that was stupid. But I am more interested in where did he get all that extra speed from?"
Yes great driving from them!
Definitely! Still managed to get third at least
"Thanks for the great response! 

I did not expect him to dive bomb, but take his change on the next and slower corner, so that is why I kept my racing line. 

Always learning :)"
"Where was he alongside at braking/corner entry? Definitely agree it's not the best move from either party, but it is the overtaking cars fault; the vortex of danger is real yo."
"Thank you!
Years and years of racing with a wheel I guess.
Lots of rallying and last few years almost only drifting. 

I think the drifing control is what saved me here. Now just learning to get better racinglines, communication and defense."
Pink clipped black and lifted on a flat corner
I braked twice as more as I should because of blacks’ great defence
"Nice paint job though, white was definitely jealous"
Great save after contact!
"well you gotta put yourself in his position. why would you wait for a corner where both of you have the same shot, when you have a huge advantage on this fast corner where the other guy iis slow. He didn't dive bomb you, you were going 30% slower than normal on that corner and he had a very clear shot at overtaking. You needed to accept the fact you were slow and give up the corner. Both incidents were avoidable."
"I'm not talking about fault. Fault is a stupid thing to ask about, *especially* in rookies. Far too many people in sim racing get hung up on who's fault it is.

I'm talking about what the OP can do to become a better driver and finish more races."
Divebomb.
Found the 1k irating driver 
"It was 10000% not a divebomb on the 2nd incident. He was going super slow and gave up the inside. Do you expect the entire field to slow way down just so he can keep his position? If you get slowed down, you either give up your position, or you crash"
"We expect morons to not dive into a closing window that doesn't exist. He was slow, but it was a TERRIBLE pass. 

Pretty simple."
"Sure was a terrible pass. But you’re missing the point. Dive bomb or not the incident happened. 

Identifying what you can do differently is infinitely more valuable then assigning blame."
It is the responsibility of the overtaking car to pass safely. He failed at that.
"Yes he did fail that. Now if only that meant OP didn’t get punted.. Remember that Pit lane is full of people who had right of way. Being in the right doesn’t magically repair your car. 

Assigning blame does not help.
Hopefully OP focuses on what he could have done to avoid this and not what someone else could have done to avoid it."
yes
"Unfortunately, yes. Lot of teams who have an incident in the first hour of the earlier time slots do this, leaving some sessions with 30-35 cars just a couple hours in"
"Pretty sure the cars would never be beyond repair. 
But yes you can always sign up for a later timeslot as well"
Yes but it’s not very gentlemanly. Reduces the car count in your original session. And you’ll probably crash out again in the second one anyway.
You most definitely can damage a car beyond the point of repair in iracing. More common with open wheelers but if you put one of the front engine gt3s head onto a wall (easy coming out of the bus stop) it will destroy the engine and you're done.
Engine will be repaired. It will take ages i think 40 or 45min but unlike open wheel it won't give you a prompt of too much damage and not repair. It will be repaired just take ages
Wow. This is my favorite I've seen posted so far. Excellent work.
Very nice.
"Looks beautiful, what did you use?"
I love this livery so much.
Done something similar with ours but kept the majority our liver just added some neon palm trees
That actually looks dope.
The only thing I don't like is the cover for the air hose is still red.
"Hello, split buddy."
Someone with talent that I don't have lol. Cosmin at Splash N Go Graphics. I know next to nothing about making these things.
"Well, it looks like money well spent 👍"
"I'm potentially interested, turns out I don't have my kids this weekend. if you can piece together enough people to build somewhat of a team then you can count me in.   


I drive everything, I prefer the prototypes but I dont have a preference"
Guys jump on my discord server here: [https://discord.gg/DnrKnyfA](https://discord.gg/DnrKnyfA) to discuss in more detail
I would be interested
Do you still have a spot for someone? I would be down if its gt3.
"Would be potentially in as well, GT3 preference but can make it work."
Yes.
"Man, this just happened to me last night. Literally last lap in GTE lemans, approaching fast indy connection just drops. was in p2 by 30 seconds and finished p6, lost like 60 irating. Very sad, but nothing i can do."
Protest your electricity provider
A similar thing happened to me last week. Internet went down for 15m. Came back online to a finished race. -155ir. RIP
"Unfortunately, yes.

A UPS battery backup is a handy thing. Unfortunately you’d need a fairly expensive one to run a gaming PC for any meaningful length of time. However if power outages are something you deal with regularly where you are; it might be an option! Remember to keep your router and any network equipment on a battery backup as well.

However, LiFePO4 batteries are coming down in price significantly and one of those coupled with an appropriately sized inverter-charger unit could get you a system that would run a whole simrig for hours for around $1,000."
"There's nothing you can do. It's an elo system so think of it as a pool of rating points. You lose some, someone gains some. If they give you your rating back it would require an inflation of rating for everyone or you'd have to take rating back from everyone who you would have finished ahead of. It sucks, but it's how it has to be. I got screwed out of a good position one because the servers were messing up and kicked several of us out. I even got back in, regained a couple positions, then got booted right back to last again.

  
Safety rating though I think they should be able to do something about. I get it's a no fault system, but when you get an 8x in the first lap minding your own business and getting rear ended and side swiped it can feel really unjust."
That bloody sucks
Yes sucks very much. Luckly i was able to gain SR. But lost like 110 irating...
DNF due to mechanical failure!
If it didn't work that way everyone would disconnect when they had a bad race. Unlucky but there's no better option.

"And is the big boys race invitational or how does that work?

"No, these work just like any official. They’re broadcasting the top split, where the SOF will be like 9k"
"If your matching or beating the leaders (or whoever is behind you) race pace, you're under no obligation to let them pass.

That being said, if they're under a second away from you, it's usually best to let them go."
"Without any recording it’s hard to know what exactly happened. That said …

Though it’s on the lead cars to pass safely, it’s also just considerate not to make it excessively difficult. 

There’s not much benefit to defend aggressively against the leaders as they come up to pass. It just slows everyone down, including yourself, and increases the chances for contact."
"The only caveat to this would be super speedways and pack racing. For the love of god some folks there don’t understand that if you’re by yourself and there are 20 cars coming, they will be there FAST and you’ve got to move out of the way early  because the speed difference is huge and everyone has to plan their moves ahead of time"
"Lapped cars that don't facilitate a safe pass under a blue flag really bug me.

You absolutely don't need to pull over, but at wherever the next straight is you should simply let off the gas.

The other cars didn't magically catch up to you. They are faster than you. They are driving your pace now because they cannot drive through your car and they have to figure out your driving to make a clean pass. 

On the flip side if you are a lapped car, you are faster, and you catch up to other cars. Then by all means, race and push the car(s) in front of you.

Just don't make it difficult on the ones coming up behind you."
"Yea, he was approaching that time and I was going to let him pass on an upcoming straight but he just couldn't wait lol"
"There’s also nothing wrong with UNlapping yourself if you have the pace. Definitely don’t make an aggressive or unsafe pass, for sure. But you can definitely unlap yourself."
"I was doing my absolute best to keep it safe, and the guy that was complaining wasn't even that close to me majority of the time lol, I just don't feel like people know what a blue flag is outside of f1 rules"
"I like what you say here. My biggest fear as a likely back marker is ruining the leaders’ race. I am always checking my relative box to make sure. What I do is look at 1, 2 and 3 difference. If they are battling within a second of each other, I will move out of the way so they can keep RACING.

Here is my frustration though: the “impatient” leader. The one who absolutely has to attempt a pass at the worst possible corner, and gets into the vortex of danger. I get that you believe you are so skilled, you can get by, but I am more than willing to let you pass, just let’s get past this corner, OK? Am I wrong here? Or should I compensate my approach to the corner to expect the aggressive pass?

Even worse? The entitled driver. Yeah, the guys that are way too far behind but think you should just get out of the way now. I make them work for it. Get right behind me, show me you can catch me, and I will facilitate the pass. But not any sooner."
"That's not what facilitating a safe pass means. iRacing clarifies it in their new driver videos. It means holding a consistent line and not defending aggressively.

If you can give a little lift to let faster cars by, and want to, by all means. But that's being nice and going beyond expectations."
"Yea I never make it difficult, the lobby was ages behind me still and was complaining about it all entitled like, I must agree to never make it difficult for them tho"
Very true.
Esteban Ocon approved ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin) Max Verstappen may not concur
"Yeah, again, you’re not required to completely jump out of the way, but an early lift going into a passing zone is just an easy way to not give up much time in your own race while also being considerate and making it relatively straight forward for leaders to pass. 

In most cases there’s zero benefit to fight to not get lapped other than ego."
"Everyone loves to freak out when a blue flag is up, like they’re entitled to pass you. 

I’m sorry, but if I got taken out on turn 1 to no fault of my own I am not going to slow down for you to pass me."
"You’re right. But in low split D class races it’s absolutely a thing that you start hearing “BLUE FLAG BLUE FLAG BLUE FLAG” over the radio from a driver who is just now starting to appear in your rear-view mirror. It’s annoying to listen to and often they genuinely think you’re supposed to like, pull off the road and park it until the faster driver is past."
"This still happens in top split A class races. Those people are at every level, and nobody likes them."
"cant remember exactly what i did to fix it but in mixed reality portal, go to settings and change the following:  


startup and desktop->open the desktop view off  
input switching: manual

&#x200B;

headset display-> sleep timeout Never  
suspend windows mixed reality off"
Thanks!! I was really hoping there was a setting
Yes it works at all of them. It’s a carry over from the oval side which features this in many cars. It’s too bad road doesn’t have this at the moment but I wish it did.
"The NASCAR stuff has a full crew too, at least for truck, xfinity and cup on ovals. I have never done road races in those cars so can’t confirm that part."
"Yup nascar and Indycar will both do this, as long as you have your pit objects at medium or higher in the graphics tab. I can confirm that for indycar they will do it at road courses as well. Not 100% sure for nascar at road courses I’d have to test it."
"Not sure about Indy Cars, but I’d imagine if it does it at one track it does it at all. All NASCAR series also have a pit crew. Not sure about ARCA, but the rest do for sure."
I think they hinted a bit at some point (can't find source) that they might be doing full pit crew for road but it's probably still a long way off at this point.
You get to actually hear the tire guns and everything. So cool.
Arca has full crews as well
"This is a thing for all road courses that have a half wall for the pits, such as Road America but not tracks that have a garage/full wall such as Suzuka.

Cars that have a pit crew include IR18, Trucks, Xfinity, Nascar Cup, and NextGen. I do believe ARCA is included."
And the Arca guys are the fastest. They will just fix your whole car and one instant.
"It may be soon for some cars, I believe they said gt3 will be first to get it. Season 2 maybe?"
My fav is the clunking as the wheel comes on and off the hub
There’s something about the way cars were scattered all over the track into La Source that foretold the carnage out of Radillion. Clearly worked out well for you though.
the benefits from starting in the back/pits.
"Tracc has been good in ACC, shame I don't have the money for NASCAR stuff at the moment."
Thats so frustrating. Hopefully you didnt get any damage.
No wheel damage but 4x incident points lol
I've been racing in VR for the last two years and I've never even heard of these terms. I'm also not competitive so take that how you will.
"It won't hold you back from beating Max Verstappen, especially if you can run at 120Hz."
"FWIW I felt a noticeable improvement in response moving from an encoder based headset (Quest 2) to a proper PCVR headset (Reverb G2).  I also got quicker and more consistent on the Reverb G2. 

 Link adds a lot of latency in doing the video encode + decode process.  And damages the video quality in the process. "
Never had any issues with VR and I only race in VR. 3k rating (if that helps)
"As for how I understand it, it affects everything you see through the headset. It doesn't affect your inputs in-game, but you'll see their effect with a small delay. I think that your brain can accept and get used to a small delay. You can predict the delay and take it into account subconsciously when steering, braking, accelerating. However, if something unexpected happens, the delay gets added to your reaction time. VR gives you 3D vision though, which really helps with depth perception. Your spatial awareness also seems to imrove, and it's really immersive and amazing overall.

Just today I tested the motion to photon latency for Assetto Corsa using the Oculus debug tool, and got 42ms with Link cable. Haven't tried to tweak it lower yet. 40ms feels acceptable to me, but it could of course be lower. With a proper DisplayPort connection, it would most likely be way lower. 
More VR headsets should have a DP connection IMO. But it is what it is, I can play like this for a couple of years possibly, until they release a PCVR headset at a reasonable price point that is actually good. Such a product doesn't currently exist in my view, all of them are making some compromises right now. I have already waited for years, and the progress has been slower than expected, so I just got into VR a few weeks ago, and despite the shortcomings and issues I can say that flat-screen gaming isn't that appealing to me any more, seeing what VR is going to be like once proper headsets come around, and as it is now, it's still extremely fun.
I played Assetto Corsa and Richard Burns Rally for 5 hours today."
Yea I ended up buying the quest. Getting low 40s in iRacing. Can’t notice it enough to care and I’m extremely particular about things like refresh rate in fps games on pc. Even in games where twitchy reactions are much more important than in sim racing the quest feels good at least so far.
"To me, 40ms for VR feels like what hitting 60fps felt like when 60 was the usual maximum. It's good enough to not be bothersome, but it could and should be better. 
I wish latency was more of a priority for VR developers.
In any case, I'm happy that I can now just play instead of waiting another year to get into VR."
Some people are just so oblivious to whats going on around them and tunnel vision to whats ahead only.
I did this once on a formation lap after my USB hub melted down and everything disconnected.

"I'm not sure, could you add a few more angles?"
Dive bombs are legal always if there is no contact. The guy kinda turned into you ultimately but at least you held the tight line and didn't blow the corner and take both of you out. The only thing dive bombs can be are annoying and risky. Using it as seasoning to get an overtake is fine but dive bombs are some people's entire dish and that makes the experience worse for everyone around them.
"Am I seeing it right, that the update already takes 4,5 hours?"
How long do the updates generally take? I’m new here.
"Honestly I can’t believe the GTP damage model still hasn’t been adjusted. The Porsche can take way more damage than the rest of the GTP class. I was able to sustain a more than 50mph head on crash in the Porsche without losing my front end and still staying below 1 minute of repairs. Every other GTP loses the nose at less than a 5mph collision and gets stuck with around 9 minutes of repairs. 

It’s incredible to me that this hasn’t even been addressed and this issue has been known since at least the beginning of December."
"I'm surprised the pit exit timesave was only now fixed, Daytona's been in the sim since 2008 and even its most recent scan has been here for at least 5 years right?"

After half of the day it looks like they dont have optimal  approach on server updates .... i.e they should have parallel set of servers as failover scenario and for patching ahead  of the release moment.
"it would be a standart practice to shut the service down to update it in 2000s, but in 2024 that’s just abysmal. 

every current platform on the web do hundreds of deploys each hour and it doesn’t disrupt the users in any way.

yet here, 20 lines of updates code cripple the service for 5 hours"
Is this when you can test drive all cars ?
This is surely the patch that adds rain to the Daytona 24

Not this long. This is unusual.

"Well Porsche has some experience with building tanks, can you say the same about other manufacturers?"
"Out of curiosity, what was the exploit? I can’t think of where you’d be able to gain time on pit exit"
"The end of the speed limit zone used to be at the end of the pit stalls rather than where it is now, I think that slowdown was designed for that. When the speed limit zone end was extended the slowdown just stayed as it was, hence the silly situation we ended up with."
It was rescanned in 2020
Yup this is a smart solution. I should have taken my chance and done the F4 regional yesterday. :(
"That's a lot of words to say ""I know fuck all about software deploys""."
"I want to apologize for my comment - I could have said the same thing without being a total dick.

I'm in software development, the kind where you have applications with months of uptime without a reboot because any disruption costs a fortune. Also the kind where, like iRacing, you have an ancient codebase with a lot of moving parts. In those cases, especially when you have to coordinate backend systems, local clients and multiple server farms, I can 100% understand why you'd chose a long update window and a clean startup over continuous deployment."
"Yes

I guess they are hot fixing the hot fix
Probably not but I guarantee most splits will have the Porsche as the main GTP.
"I doubt it. BOP is really tight right now. With the Porsche getting a nerf on Wednesday, Acura being tough to drive but maybe fastest over a lap, and BMW perennially unpopular, I think it will be a good mix but Cadillac as the favorite car."
"Most of my officials seem to be Cadillac heavy. 

For the record: we’re driving the Cadillac too."
"Cadillac also produced tanks

Most American auto makers committed a large amount of their production lines to planes, ammo, trucks, and tanks"
"ride near left side wall just after the safety car parking spot. it will give you a slowdown, but it will run out well before pit exit"
"yeah, I work in infra for a company with 80mil MAU, so I know a thing or two"
how many times can you recall facebook or insta had an intentional maintenance downtime?
Fire fix
"When you say the acura is tough to drive, do you mean that a nerf is due? 
Because yesterday I test driven the Acura on nords and it was literally impossible for me to spin it.
My main is the caddy and if I don’t pay attention at the accelerator especially with cold tires on exits I send it to the moon, with the Acura I could slam on the accelerator and at worst it would slide a little bit.

I’m genuinely curious because now I get it why splits are full of Acuras right now, and I’m on the verge of buying it :)"
"With the right setup the Acura glides over the track, has the least fuel and tire consumption and is only a bit slower than the Porsche. Cadillac is sketchy through the busstop at the end of a full fuel tank. Porsche is super stable and still fastest after BoP. BMW is a tire killer. The splits will be mainly Porsche and Acura, maybe a tiny amount of Cadillacs"
"Only in the lower splits though, top splits is still Porsche and Acura, you need a good setup for them though"
What happens now?
Bots dont count as users my guy
Niche hobby video games and multi-billion social media giants are totally comparable
"Go buy it, though maybe the turbo lag will kill your lap time in the horseshoes but for the Daytona is not a big problem."
Probably a longer slowdown.
"Unsafe pit exit penalty, a drivethrough"
40s stop and go penalty I believe for unsafe pit exit
"Plus like... No one is going to have issues if their Facebook feed is on getting data from one version and someone else's another

This kind of needs everyone on the exact same version at the same time to work right."
Unsafe pit exit penalty. I believe that’s a drive through
"Good information, thank you!"
"2.2k, sure it's him?"
Nice always love seeing guys who are pros racing fun stuff on iracing. I suck at the Mazdas these days though so everyone in this split would probably dust me. I once beat Carson Hocevar in an off road truck race and I cherish that moment forever.
cool! I just raced Daniel Dye at Indy in Xfinity last week.
"I've encountered Will Power, Frederik Vesti, and Ollie Bearman and they absolutely kicked my ass.  Really puts into perspective how fast they are irl if they can do it so good on a simulator too."
"Antonio Giovinazzi isn't even 2k on road. Alot of NASCAR drivers arent any higher than 3k, aside from regulars like Rajah Caruth. Not everyone dedicates as much time to it as Max Verstappen."
Found one of his streams on youtube where he had the name and same helmet design so pretty sure its him
Will Power is a beast in the F3. I’ve raced against him a couple times and I couldn’t keep up.
I was in a week 13 Super Formula race with Ayumu Iwasa last season. I’ve seen Will Power as well. Scott McLaughlin and Alex Palou were in a few Bathurst sessions with me about a year ago. Both in McLarens. I love running into pros in sessions.
Rajah was around 1.7k when I raced him a couple weeks back in Ferrari fixed
Check his oval rating. Different licenses.

idk if you're trying to karma farm by telling me I'm wrong, or if you looked up the wrong guy, but.."
I’m all good until I see the delta of the guy behind closing in. Even if he’s 10 seconds away 😂
The amount of times I’ve done this or just lost focus and crashed is embarrassing.
Opposite. While I'm fighting for position I'm in the zone. When I get a lead I feel I can knock it back to 90%... Then I fall off the track.
Not really. I generally race at a repeatable pace in general so when I'm winning it's easy to just keep hitting those marks. Don't feel the need to push or take risks
You guys win races? 🥹
It must be nice to have comfortable wins to throw away. 
"In said case, I prefer to drive below 100%. I usually brake slightly earlier and put extra focus on making sure my inputs are as smooth as possible. Especially my pedal inputs. After all, if you have a decent buffer you can afford to drive a bit slower. Calculating risk vs reward is paramount when it comes to racing. Even more so the longer the races are. No point in taking unnecessary risks, because there's nothing to gain and everything to lose. I took over that philosophy from Niki Lauda and it's my most useful tool during races, especially enduro's"
"I don't get bored if I have a comfortable gap and a good result, I start to freak myself out and fixate on not having an accident. Which makes an accident much more likely."
I wouldn’t know 🥲
Has happened more times than i can count.  Feels worse when its the last lap lol.
"Winning is winning, it doesn’t matter whether it’s by 0.1 seconds or 10 seconds - there’s no need to win by a mile if you can comfortably by less. So the question is if you had to choose, do you want to win, or just go fast?

I often see drivers try to set fast laps in races, and this is my philosophy that I try to impart on them - practice is where you try to go fast, a race is where you execute what you practiced."
"Hahaha I often wonder, when watching F1 races, how Max or Lewis keep going faster when they’re in the lead lol ps, I know that’s their job, but still..that concentration!

I’m learning to listen to Jim, just focus on Apexes & exits"
I space out if I’m too far in the lead. But that’s rare enough
"Last night, top 5 stays out, rest of field pits. I start 6th with 5 to go at Atlanta. Going for the lead with 3 to go, too much throttle into 1, get loose, smack the wall... Caution... Finished 9th 1 lap down."
Getting bored is the last thing id do. My heart would be pounding and I'd inevitably make a big mistake because I'm anxious lol
Yes. I won at Road America in Skippy’s several years ago. I had a 19 second lead because some folks tried to win on the first lap and I skated through it and just did my thing. Second to last lap I botched turn 5 and spun out. After having navigated it like 17 times up until that point lol. Thankfully it wasn’t too bad as I was able to win by about 10 seconds. I don’t know why my brain does that. It just shits itself on one random turn. That one turned in my favor but there’s been so many instances that ended up in the pits.
Winning comfortabley? I don't have that problem
"Unless you’re in the top split, just keep winning until you stop winning. It shouldn’t take long as the IR gains should be big and you’ll end up with aliens to put you in check 😂"
"Happened to me in a league race last night. 13 seconds ahead on the final lap of a 4 lap Nordschleife race, put it in the wall trying to get fastest lap."
Allll the timeeee!!! Its the worst when you land pole and then psych yourself out in the first 3-5 laps
"Not even winning, if I'm not close to someone i make errors all over the place and my times increase."
"Depends on the situation. If I’ve got a healthy lead, I won’t take risks. Will put the brake bias a click forward and on tricky corners brake a few metres earlier. Risk-based approach."
"I don't know, I never win comfortably..."

"Yuuuuup. I know this feeling *very* well. I'm incapable of not bragging a bit here but I find myself in 1st place, well ahead of 2nd place, quite frequently. I guess I'm just naturally decent because it's been this way since I started iRacing. But when I started iRacing I was used to racing around others but not being in the lead. I've crashed from first soooooo many times because I got bored and try to push or I took a fastest lap as a direct attack on me and would try to beat it. I was more than capable of being fast enough over a short period to make it into first but not consistent or patient enough to hold first.

But I've learned and grown since then. Now when I get into the lead I just try to stay calm and focused, do the job, collect the IR/SR. I'll push **only** if I think second has a reasonable chance at catching me. I watch their gap, calculate lap-by-lap if they'll catch me by the end. And if I determine that they can catch me with like a lap left I know I can defend and I'd rather have tires for that instead of trying to push and run away. One thing to catch, another to pass. Otherwise consistency is key.

There's a distinct difference in my post race reports from before I had this mindset to after. Before, my lap times would be all over the place. Whole second differences. But now if I have more than a half second delta between lap times I know I wasn't focused enough (or I had a breakthrough with that track/car during the race). I literally tell myself, once I'm in the lead, to focus. I have to actively stop myself from getting distracted. I have to stop myself from pushing. All of those take self-control and self-awareness, both of which are skills to learn just like trail braking or a racing line. It's an active thing. So next time you're in the lead literally tell yourself to focus and not do anything dumb. Focus on smooth, consistent driving. Take it corner by corner, even resolve down to the section of the corner if you have to. Focus on the moment. And then when you have a collection of good moments you'll have won.

And all of this has prepared me to move into higher series. I don't move along when I can be competitive on one-lap pace. I move up when I feel that I can compete over a whole race. I practice and practice and practice until I'm consistent in the car, then it's just a matter of learning the track in that car. And since I've worked out the mindset part of things I can really focus on the specifics of my situation."
[removed]
Have definitely done this before when racing sub 2k sofs. Pushing to go faster and faster each lap is how you get...faster in general. I think it's fine until you have a couple of warnings then dial it back a bit and focus on the win
I don’t win a lot so I just do my best to stay as laser focused as I can. I definitely don’t get bored in the lead even if I pull away. This past weekend I won the ROAR in the LMP3 and I was under pressure for the entire race. I only won by 3.8 seconds after 2.4 hours. They made me earn that win.
"Yep.

With a car in front I am zoned in and hit my marks. Don't even worry about who is chasing me. Let me get the lead though and I start driving like I've never seen a braking marker or apex in my life. I also hyperfocus on the relative."
Do more endurance races - Roar was a great practice of just putting down laps without crashing and slowing down when you feel like your concentration is off.
"I did it in Road Atlanta, F4, last chicane. It was always tricky there, but I had found my comfort braking zone. And then it happened, I got the lead, I was starting to pull away, 6 laps to go, and I had the slightest unsettled car at the entry and I lost it."
"I’ll let you know if I ever get to win comfortably in iRacing :)

But yes in other games staying focused when you in a large lead is keen, easy for the mind to wonder."
"Self-control, a win is a win by hakf a second ir by 15 seconds.  Once i realize im pulling away. I pace myself and slow down so this doesnt happen. 

Lessons learned."
"Nope.

I’m not great in terms of absolute pace, but have a good feel for settling into a rhythm just below my limit and sitting there all day. Every time I’ve won it’s involved a marginally quicker driver making mistakes, and then I’ve converted the lead by just sitting at a steady pace and managed the gap.

Every time I crash myself out it’s because I’m pushing too hard trying to chase someone quicker down.

I recommend running the time trial mode and just forcing yourself to lap at a competitive pace trying to avoid making a single offtrack or loss of control for the whole 30 mins (note - crashing will lose you SR!)"
"What is this ""lead a race"" you speak of? Is this one of those brand new sentences I see popping up in my feed? /s"
"I used to be, now I yell at myself over and over again to intentionally drive like a second a lap slower or even more in order to take zero risks"
"In the beginning I only felt safe if I had a 10s lead because I knew I would fuck up and lose 10 seconds at some point.

It will go away eventually."
I turn on tunes to help focus when leading like that (doesn’t happen often). Helps keep a better smooth flow/rhythm for me.
"Not usually, no. But I was racing in Rookie Pro Lite's recently and was new to the track, had a pretty big lead and was pulling away so I was trying to turn faster laps to test the limits. Ended up going over a barrier which immediately towed me back to pits for just over a minute. Lost the lead and the race and was 2 laps down at the end lol."
Yeah as soon as I don't have someone in front of me to hunt down my ADHD kicks in hard and suddenly I'm snapping back to focus as my braking marker goes flying by with my foot firmly planted on the throttle. I've gotten alright at developing strategies that help but I've definitely binned it from a solid lead before because of it.
The last 3 times i have been leading and easily the quickest person on track i decide i want to put in the wall
"I go faster with people close by. Solo, I have no reference."
"I race better in 2nd keeping pace and looking to pass then in the lead. F1600 last night up 15 seconds, got more nervous and lost control. Recovered and kept a 3 second lead and grew it back out to 10. Started stressing again"
Wait y’all win races?
"I managed to score a win in the Roar before the 24 last weekend, I managed to hold the lead for the last 45 minutes, and I was entirely certain I was going to lose due to making a mistake the entire time. Managed to hang onto my 6 second lead but was stressing the entire time!"
"I don’t crash trying to go faster, I just crash"
"My concentration has improved with age, and I get a kick out of being consistent, the problem is I get a kick out of being as consistently fast as I possibly can. I am probably worse when chasing tho, as I overdrive."
"no. I can control my pace to keep the distance. If they lap faster, I do respond."
"Whether I'm in first or last, I'm always my worst enemy"
"Yep, 100%. Sometimes when P2 entirely disappears from my relative I get complacent, I can manage puahing or underdriving, but when my concentration slacks, I make rookie errors. Not spinning trying to go for faster laps, moreso hitting a wall I've never hit before, turning in way early for lack of focus, or when doing IMSA, just entirely misjudging traffic and wrecking myself. I pride myself on the ability to cope with traffic really well, but you need 100% focus, and when that's gone, mistakes come flooding. A while ago dokng IMSA at mosport, I was running a perfect race, 10S off lapping P2, but I just get onto a curb I only tried once to see if it works. Done 90 laps cleanly, 0x, 0 mistakes, and suddenly and mindlessly I run wide thinking about dinner, and due to total lack of focus I just floor it and give myself half an hour of repairs.
It happens, you just have to learn to pace yourself and keep focussed. I get the urge to try and find time, but when you're leading by 20s, there's no use, just cruise to the win and try finding speed in practice after if you feel you can find more. Learn to disregard the urge to win by more, or get the fastest lap, it means nothing. P1 is p1, no matter if it's by 7 milliseconds or 3 laps"
"I look at relative vs the amount of laps, but I dont push if im at the front."
"About a year in and still have yet to win a race. 

I guess I did win one with the trucks, but I don’t count that I felt like a Smurf in rookie class."
"My attention span so small.  Sometimes in a straight I'll start enjoying the graphics, the scenery,  my whole setup.  Ahhh fuck I've binned it"
You guys are winning?
I think everyone most likely runs into that phase but as you lead more and win more it becomes more comfortable and you just learn to relax almost becoming desensitized to it like it's now just another day in the office.
"Depends what I'm racing tbh. 

Super Formula takes a fair amount of precision no matter how much of a lead you have. Also not a terrible idea to keep a quick eye on relative. Some people seem to have a lot more boost than me in the later stages of a race.

Mx, Vee or GR86 I'm cruisin' and pretty relaxed"
"Yes, I too have opinions about what it’s like to “win comfortably” because this is a common experience for me as well. For sure. Yep."
"I’m so bad for that, somehow haven’t learnt my lesson yet"
"I used to be my own worst enemy. Now if I ever get a comfortable lead, I just back it off a small bit to maintain the gap. If the gap is closing, I push where I know I can push hard without consequence, and take it easy in the places where exceeding the limits of the car can result in big trouble."
I would love to be able to win. Let alone comfortably
I would love to be able to win. Let alone comfortably
"I usually try and force myself to practice off-speed lines. Gives me practices finding speed on suboptimal racing lines, while being less dangerous than hot lapping.

I also want to thank you and guys like you. So many of my wins have come where I was definitely not the fastest car, but the leader dumped themselves and gifted me a win.

Between free wins and the lesson to not push the car, you guys have been the real ones."
"No, the very few times I was that much ahead I just lift and coast to an easy win if the margin is that big. More risk in any given corner or part of the track and I back off even more there. You dont get anything by winning over 20 second vs. 5 seconds. Even if I am at 8th and its not possible to catch people up front and there is a confortable gap behind too, I will back off a bit.

If I am being pushed then obviously need to take the risks."
I turn my relative off if I have a big lead so I’m not focused on laps remaining or if the guy behind is making gains. Just hit my marks
"I watch it for a lap or two, then try to calculate the striking distance, helps reduce the tension after"
"I hate that shit, my feet start feeling nervous lmao. I’ve bottled at least 5-6 comfortable leads since starting iRacing"
"Me 2 nights ago thinking to myself mid race: ""the Nordschleife is really difficult, if you lose concentration you almost immediately crash""
Then I forgot which corner I was on because I was trying to think to myself and crashed"

Happy cake day
"Look at Mr big shot. Mr I don’t get bored while im in the lead. Get off your pedestal & crash like the rest of us big shot

All said in jest…I hope I’m able to concentrate like this one day"
This is the way
[deleted]
"Yeah, what is this ""winning comfortably"" thing?"
"I had a guy whining at the end of a race because he was ""so much faster"" than I was but didn't have enough time to catch me. To be fair, he was running about a second faster a lap than I had been. 


I just popped in on chat and said, ""Is that so?"" and promptly did a lap almost 2 seconds faster than him to win. I didn't realize I was laying back that hard. I was just vibing to some music and cruising."
I have repeated it so many times. Racing is not hot lapping in traffic.
They keep going faster because of lower fuel
Happened to me in the 87's the other day.  Pushed too hard going for the lead in turn 4.  Self spun but luckily got a caution and came home 3rd.
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
And then you miss the lap car that wrecked ahead of you
I use the relative on racelabs so I think it would be very difficult to turn it off mid race 😂
"I keep it off at all times in race, seem to do better without it.

I just use it in practice."
Just scroll down so you only see relative ahead not behind then.
"You are a genius! I’ve started doing this. I keep the main page on. The one that shows the laps, position etc that way I only look at the relatives by lap."
Be careful of the opposite when you back off too much and then end up losing it cause you aint used to it lol
"I have the same issue. What I've found helps me is to run suboptimal lines. Find speed practicing racing in traffic and finding good lines through corners with off angle entries or shallow exits.

Just watch the relative. Don't wanna give up a big lead by shaving a second off a lap."
Meanwhile my heart pounds when I’m in a podium spot in 900 SOF
"I mean, I can still see ahead of me. It’s not like I’m solely relying on my relative for things like that. I’d more likely see the car vs notice it on my relative anyways"
"Fyi, you can pan around in the blackbox (not sure on default controls but I assigned to wheel buttons).

In these situations I push myself to the bottom of the Relative list so I can only see those ahead, also useful when doing an extra post-race SR lap and knowing when the last finisher crosses the line (the time remaining isnt always reliable for this)"
you aint got eyes in the front of your head?
"You can bind a button to hide overlays. Not sure if you can hide specific overlays, but it’s worth a look in the settings."
100% this
Can you really still get extra SR by running another lap after the race is over? I thought they stopped counting post race laps.
"Yeah I’ll have to check it out for sure, or just become a bit more level headed 😂"
"After the leader crosses the line, the race officially ends when everyone else finishes the lap they are on (or the event timer runs out first). SR can still be gained for as long as that lasts.

If you are finishing near the front of the pack there is usually enough field-spread so that you can get ½ - ⅔ lap of extra corners. By doing a full cooldown lap you guarantee you will get the max available, and not have to worry about it."
You already answered your question.
"True. However, I feel like the front wheels should have touched as well in that case but it looks like they did not."
"You can make the replay save the original data rather than the updated positions in future if you'd prefer. In your Documents/iracing folder, edit app.ini and set replayPatchRemoteCars=0"
It’s all 100% net code
"Did not know that, thank you :)"
"We are looking for drivers for our Team, but not for this Event. (See Video description above)"
"Overlays are also ran in the browser. Kapps for me for example is accessible by going to [http://127.0.0.1:8185](http://127.0.0.1:8185)   


[127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) means localhost (refering to the current PC). Replace that with the IP address that's exposed to the network.  


1. hit WIndows + R
2. Type cmd and hit enter
3. Type ipconfig and hit enter
4. You'll find you ip address there (use the IPv4 variant)

You can use that ip address plus the port (:8185 in my case) to access the overlay that runs on your gaming pc from your streaming pc.  


I'm pretty sure it's not possible for overlay software to connect to iRacing over the network. At least I have never seen it"
so i need the kapps programm open in my gaming pc and the  put the browser into my streaming pc?
Doesnt have to be kapps. Simhub and Racelab work the same way for example
So does iOverlay. I’d give it a try over all of the others first.
gotch you 😃 so where do i need the programm open on the gaming pc or on the streaming pc or in both ?
"Overlay is open on the gaming PC yes, like I said"
"iOverlay open on GamePC and you add browser source in OBS on streaming PC with http://ipaddressofgamingpc/pages/relative etc etc

You find the correct URL per overlay in iOverlay on gaming PC. Just replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP address of gaming PC."
thank you im gonna test this tomorrow i really hope this works would be great😃
thank you very much its working 😍😍😍
You’re welcome!
"It’s ok for learning the track but the braking points are very conservative and it isn’t dynamic so it doesn’t account for drafting or tire wear. Most people who use it plateau quite a bit because subconsciously they don’t drive outside the limits of the line. 

Being on the service for 6 years now I never met anyone who uses it who was better than average. Most were average at best. 

But to each his own. Most of the hate comes from the “immersion” guys who have wind blowing in their face in a 10k sim rig and wear a driving suit while they race and only have like 1400 IR. I wouldn’t worry about it too much."
"There's no racing line in real life. It causes problems. Tons of people stick to it like glue and good luck everyone else if they are side by side. Honestly, can't people learn the track well enough to get the idea after a handful of laps? You'll learn much quicker if you make mistakes and try to fix them yourself."
"If your references are getting destroyed or obstructed, you need to find better references. Also ironic that you say not being obstructed is a pro for the driving line (notice iracing doesn't call it a racing line, consider that), when being on the track surface itself, it is the easiest reference to be obstructed by things like other cars, or elevation changes of the track."
"Same argument my 4 year old grandson makes about the training wheels on his bike, albeit OP is a little more eloquent with his argument.

I guess same goes. 

Turn it off when you’re ready mate. No one will make fun of you."
"Being fine without it puts you in a very small minority group of people who can use that line as a reference and not a guide. You are effectively using the normal markers with the racing line as a fallback one. 

The line gets hate because most of its users *need* it just to drive. If you have it from day 1 you build a reliance on it, instead of building the ability to get reference markers. It causes crashes as people blindly follow the line regardless of whats around them, or if they do share then they over/under cook their braking into the turn, they do not know how to drive the track any other way. 

Using it to learn a track is absolutely fine though, saves you the 10 minutes of figuring out what direction the turns of the track go in so you can just jump straight into working on entry and exits."
2500 iR and use the driving line? Press X for doubt
"You are using a site picture (references) that do not exist.  Driving lines unintentionally train the user to ""eyes down"" decreasing situational awareness and this leads to far more incidents.

The sooner you train on a real site picture and keep your ""eyes up"" the sooner you become a better racer and more stable close quarters competitor."
"Your second paragraph is the hate, you do understand. It doesn’t mean there aren’t benefits, but you clearly stated the issue with it. Then add that people follow it in a race and turn using it despite if a car is there or not. They get fixated on it much like fixation on someone’s bumper rather than the next turn and upcoming brake markers leading them to yell “you broke to early” as they slam into someone."
"Here’s an analogy:  I use GPS every I go in real life. I never learn how to get to places on my own. I don’t know any street names. 

Does GPS get me to where I’m going? Yes. Is it a crutch that slows me down from learning faster? Also yes. "
"some people treat iRacing as a videogame and some people treat it as an alternative to actual racing 


if your interest is being the best at a videogame and the racing line helps you than yeah sure, the racing line is good  


of course if you're smart about using the line (granted this is extremely rare) it's easier than learning the actual track markers  


but then when you get to class levels where driving lines aren't allowed you'll realize you don't actually know the tracks at all, not to mention if you're ever lucky enough to track time on an actual race track there won't be any racing line 


really it sounds like all you're doing is using virtual track track markers... so why not just use actual track markers? 



if it's just a videogame to you it won't make a difference but some people enjoy the simulation aspect "
"Depends if you want brainless racing, or if you want to actually get better. Your choice really"
"It can be helpful for both learning the track + for folks with some eyesight disabilities. And I'm not saying that *to be insulting*, I'm being serious. There's a disabilities forum in iRacing where one of the staff had recommended this and it helped some folks out a lot.

Some folks just need to feel a form of elitism about it. I personally don't run it, but I don't mind if folks do. Just, if someone else isn't driving on it, don't get all uppity if you got in the way.

Since we had folks who did that, folks started hitting back. So it becomes a vicious cycle of toxicity. That's all.

End result: No one should care what anyone else is using as an aid. If the driving line helps you feel less anxiety and you're not causing anyone else problems, so be it, race with the driving line on.

So long as you aren't causing problems in others races, none of that should be anyone else's business. And anyone who pretends like ""they know otherwise"" is still in their ちゅうにびょう  phase."
Its because you will inevitably turn it off one day and leave it off and after a few weeks you'll find yourself improving faster and realize that having a crutch like the racing line on has been holding you back all along but new drivers always think they know better and everyone here gets tired of trying to explain why you're wrong. So go ahead and hamstring yourself all you want. When you're ready to start actually learning just go ahead and turn it off. Will feel worse for a bit but then you'll start to see real improvement to your fundamental skills.
"great point. I kind of had an inkling that a good amount of people against the line hated it because of the notion that it’s for beginners and there is a stigma attached to it.

As expected, the “i’m too good for such a thing” elitists as well as the “line bad because everyone says line bad” people made their appearance and were easy to recognize. BUT some people who knew what they were talking about made some great insights and claims,which, thanks to them."
"I would like to add, another big issue with the driving line is the people who fixate on it. I've seen it time and time again, people with no situational awareness, glued to the driving line, not caring about any other cars in the track if they're not on the driving line.

The driving line teaches you one line. You're never running just one line in a race"
I don’t respect anyone who doesn’t simrace with a helmet on.
Yes but 1400 is above average so maybe you have met line users that are better than average?
"yea definitely but it’s only a negative if you RELY on the line, using it as your reference for every corner on every track. which i definitely don’t.

One time I was watching a track guide (forgot what track) and the guy was like “so for my brake marker i like to use this patch of dirt on the left hand side”. like seriously? and there were no real other landmarks or anything and in that specific corner. Yes I could eyeball it and probably be quick enough, but i’m a human I’m not Kimi and i would be way more confident especially in the situation where the apex and exit is obscured by another car to have a concrete reference. That’d probably be the only time I look at the line the entirety of the lap."
What if i so happen to enjoy riding my bike with training wheels?😡

X"
"Plus, it just makes it take longer to find the actual brake markers on the tracks"
"They should make a version of iRacing where there is no track, just a line to follow. Like mariokart rainbow road. The ""gamers"" would eat it up"
"This is my favorite response, this was the kind of conversation i was hoping to spark and this is probably the truest statement here. 

Something I will pay more attention to in the future is whether or not i am subconsciously being “over consistent” by using the same ticks for braking despite tire wear, or perhaps a mistake or something in the last corner that slightly changes my line."
"This. It's a different thing to see how fast you can follow a predetermined and color-coded dashed line vs actually being fast around a racetrack. And don't even get me started on folks who are glued to the line and complain someone ""turned in on them."""
"new to iracing, not new to racing. and while i’m not a pro i have enough seat time to report that the visual and tactile feedback IRL in a 3d space doesn’t necessarily translate entirely to 2d iracing on a screen, and personally, starting IRL and moving to the sim i need all the help i can get in terms of visual referencing of virtual space. Maybe it’s bc i’m new to the sim but whatever part of my brain that can calculate throwing and catching a ball and throwing a car through a corner, is not quite as effective looking at a 2d screen"
It's 50 above average cmon.... You literally start at 1350.
(Name redacted for protection against the violent anti-lineites)
"what you don't seem to be understanding is that that it seems you're simply using the racing line as track markers


as long as you continue to use the racing like you will never learn the actual track markers 


it's not different than a 5 year old who doesn't want to take the training wheels off his bike 


just bite the bullet and after a week or two you'll be chuckling at yourself that you used the line for so long "
"Road average is about 1280 right now.  
I just find that a lot of people seem to think that around 2k is average  and that might be a big contributor to some members frustrations when they struggle or plateau."
"You get 3 extra sets of tires in B Open. You will need to stop for fuel; try to wait until a caution comes out during the pit window.

[OSR](https://osracing.net/) has decent setups that are usually free.

The Next Gen car is terrible and you're better off sticking with B class 😉"
"The main difference is that occasionally in the open series you get some fairly long green stints, so tire management can be much more important, but you can just emulate the lead cars and pit when they do if you want to play it safe. Otherwise I’ve always found the fixed setups to be just fine. I was able to do quite well for a long time before subbing to a setup service. Save your money and find what’s free imo.

Personally I love the next gen car, so once you gain an A license definitely give them a shot."
"You want to have fun turning left? Turn right occasionally! 

I'm sorry. I had to. 

I see now you're actually a road guy looking to expand. Good on you. I can't do it. I tried and I found it incredibly boring."
Turning right is frowned upon
"Another Roadie here, got my oval D license and also having a lot of fun. I quite like short tracks so will give SK Modified a try, doesn’t seem very popular though."
Thanks a lot! So the popular series are XFINITY and gen4 cup?
"Personally, I enjoy the Next Gen, don’t get the hate. I usually bounce back and forth between A and B fixed."
Sadly all setups I've tried from OSR failed.
"I found it the exact opposite of boring!

The focus level is insane! I've done entire races with a car 1 tenth in front and another 1 tenth in the back praying for a safety car, tire saving, pit stop strategies. I love it!"
"In D license you should get the chevy impala and run the ARCA series, it's super popular and it will teach you the basics of tyre saving!

I did ford legends for C license, and now in B I'm in love with nascar XFINITY.

C license races and above have safety car"
"From [here](https://iracingreports.com/stats/23s4-Oval.html) for last season:

https://preview.redd.it/y8vqsf6tlddc1.png?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b88d9d8782d07f630109f7b2309169fd23b65c67

Popular doesn't mean best."
"Next gen car is fine, it is a little harder to drive but I like it.  I only drive A and B in Oval."
"Seeing road guys develop an appreciation for oval racing is one of the coolest things about iRacing, imo. It looks boring and simple on TV most of the time and is one of those things that you really don’t get unless you try it."
"I’ve got the ARCA car too so will be doing both, although main goal is the Indy 500."
"Thanks! Yes you're right, coming from the road side there are a lot of dead series, with popular I meant ""there are some splits"""
"I'm not sure how it'll work now your subscription has expired, but I switched my steam account over to iRacing when it was active by emailing their customer support and asking them to do it. It was done within a couple of hours and it was a smooth switch - I kept all my content."
"Just email support, they'll ask for some information and let you know that its permanent once you do so. I switched over like 5 years ago, took about 3 emails back and forth."
How long ago was this.  I had seen previous discourse on this where they would not honor it and I had just started a new account to break away from steam.
"Thanks, I have emailed and it has been switched over already"
"They've always been fine with Steam => iRacing because it means they don't need to give Steam a cut of sales. 

The other way (iRacing => Steam) is something they can't/won't do"
"Last October, so not long. No harm in emailing them to ask, they should respond pretty quickly."
"I did it back in November, a few weeks before the BF deals, and asked them directly if it would be in time for me to be able to have the deals, they said yes, it would be instant."
Much appreciated
only thing i could really think of to increase the load on the brakes would be to press the brake harder
"Iracing brake temp has no performance implications. They don't model it. 

You really don't need to give brake temps any thought at all. That's why VRS and other driving schools never bother with brake temp"
You're over thinking it. I've never thought of checking brake temps and have never seen anyone compare them in telemetry. They don't even appear in the usual VRS and G61 telemetry comparison apps.
That makes sense. I might be going too easy on the pedal. Thanks!
i mean it has to be modelled at least in some form. given that previously brake dragging on qualy outlaps was used partially because of brake heat. and some cars have rotor temp on the dash
Wow really? So it doesn't even affect tire temperatures like ABS does?
"Definitely over thinking it for a car like the MX-5, but I thought some insight on optimizing the brakes would be useful later on when racing in more advanced cars with more complex setups."
"But i also wouldn't really change my driving because of something like this. Like test,look at telemetry sure. But not just based of only this. Tbh i doubt really anyone looks at brake temps "
"I guess you are right, but I was looking for a little more braking force in the rear to get just a bit more rotation mid turn."
I mean in open sets you can always adjust other things on the setup to get more rotation.
"I have been playing with ride height, and that did wonders for rotation; however, I still wonder why this car has no brake bias adjustment."
"Who knows. My guess would be is that it's possibly running the stock braking system outside of calipers, pads and discs"
"Again, you are probably correct. Thanks for taking the time to help me out! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)"
"Are you like, asking it to go higher?"
I don't understand this post. Are you asking a question we can help you answer?
It just hasnt updated yet. Give it a bit.
Yes i would but Is very hard to do
"I try to find Friends to race! Actually, i race in the Ferrari fixed and i have the goal to improve the irating"
I try to increase mine to 1900! This week end on Daytona Ferrari fixed
"Wut?

Is this a question or.....


Whats going on here?"
The question Is how improbe in short time ?
Continue racing and hopefully finishing above where iRacing thinks you should.
![gif](giphy|TPXLGvxazECTyFIL2W)
"For half the field, the race is usually around 2-30 seconds."
it was quicker to post this on reddit than it was to look this up on the actual iracing site??
The same app or webpage says it…
"for future reference, you can find answers to all of your simple questions like this in the iracing UI"
"In UI, go to shop, press left mouse buttons on SF, on opened window you can find tab with series on this car and check schedule for this season, race duration and when next race."
"Fixed is 15 minutes of race time.

Open is 35 minutes of race time."
good posting.
What website (joke about last patch that has made a bunch of boomers mad)
Lmao thats what I was thinking
It was quicker to comment this on Reddit than it was to just give a straight answer ??
Ok thank u
https://members-ng.iRacing.com :D
"Yes, it was."
Now this is a perfect example of a top notch humble brag
Just wait till you get to try the SuperFormula!
f4 downforce and corner speed is amazing after the mazda. also i feel like if i make mistakes with the f4 i can save it much more often.
"I’ve had super polarized experienced.  First 2 races this week were super clean and competitive. Top 10 finishes with 2x by avoiding all the trouble. Then had one that was so bad, I couldn’t get out of the way of people dive bombing or pushing me off the edge, nor could I seem to find any flow even with space. It was like I got rattled and then couldn’t get back under control. 15x and a week of SR gains gone in 25 min."
"I agree, the F4 car is so damn fun to drive. My first couple of races were really rough but I got the hang of it. My only issue is being able to do consistent, quick laps."
Of course it's the Red Bull car making a reactionary block...
[deleted]
"As someone who joined the service for pretty much everything but Formula open wheel, this post makes me really consider trying them."
"I also started doing F4 just last week, it’s been a blast. I’m planning on making the move into open wheel series from having really on raced GT stuff. F4 is fun, the F3 will be a challenge. And to the Formula A/ Super Formula drivers, you guys are crazy, those cars are monsters. Gimme a few months and I’ll join you all in some races."
Open wheel just made me love the game that little bit more
"I haven’t even drove a f3 car yet but I’ve found in previous games that the faster the cars the less close the racing is (similar to real life) moto3 and MotoGP, f3 and f1, cadet karts and rotax karts for example. Mostly because of slipstream keeping it close"
"Man, those things are wild. I also just started making the switch from GT to formula series, so I'm def rookie-esque in these cars. The super formula though, jesus christ. Been playing in VR, those things are rockets on wheels. You gotta be on your inputs or your just off that track at 150+"
"Ngl I like F4 more. Superformula is close but it's just too fast a car for the amateur racing we're simulating.

I wish it had a launch control, the speed differences going into T1 make it such a lottery who comes out the other end, at least in my sub 2k splits."
100% I haven’t spun the f4 car yet so maybe I’m not trying hard enough 😂
"I have found myself in other categories that if I have a disappointing start I start to ‘over drive’ or try to hard. Sometimes I think you need to recognise what’s happening and just say to yourself ‘smooth smooth smooth’ bring the tyres back into a good range and get that flow. But I’ve had races like that so I know where you’re coming from. I think the aim of the game is get into top or near top splits and the drivers are a bit better, they’ll give you space, won’t go for moves that aren’t on etc because everyone just wants to finish the race"
"Lol same, done 3 races, 

first one, guy tank slappers end of the straight into me  
second one messy and i messed with brakes setup before it so even worse for me and finished mid pack  
third, guy comes from a car length behind me to kill me at the bus stop chicane trying to defend someone passing him"
Dude check out my most recent post. I had a guy do the most intentional brake checking/wrecking I’ve ever seen. Mfs really think they’re Max Verstappen at Spa
"It’s just all about practice, I usually try and get a time where I feel like that’s all I can achieve. Then I’ll go onto YouTube and find a track guide and gain a fair chunk there. From then I start racing and although you don’t learn much racing, you do become much more familiar with the track. From then, I’m out of ideas 😂 you could probably start comparing telemetry at that point, but with the limited time I have available don’t bother. I hope that helps."
I wasn’t racing him too hard I can assure you 😂
Just scroll on. No need to comment
I definitely recommend giving them a go. I remember when I first started I tried the vee. Didn’t think I’d ever get into another open wheel from there on lol
Sounds like we’re on similar paths. I love how slow but yet still very racey this f4 car is
"Why are you being down voted lol, I love seeing posts like these. Great clips "
"It is pretty great, I agree. Nice overtake btw :)"
"Try open wheel in VR, if you haven’t already. It’s soooo good"
"I've had great racing in both classes. Though I tend to drive the F4 more as it is easier with little practice, but the SF is so much fun even with a little more spread out grid. 

Anyway, welcome to open wheelers! Hope to see you on the grid and have some tight wheel-to-wheel battles with you :)"
"F3 is just as intense, doesn’t start to spread out until after F3"
Once you find the limit every fast corner you’ll know if you give it a hair more gas you might spin. But I also love F4. More so than F3 because it’s more go karty and fun. Ive also had a good week so far at Spa. 3 top 3’s so far myself.
"I know that 85% of the issues in that race were my own doing. The rest I just couldn't respond to because I was just off and couldn't get settled back into the smooth groove. It will be ok though, Nothing that I can't come back from."
"In my race last night I saw someone do a 1.21 and I’m thinking how the hell would I find 5 seconds when the car is already on rails 😂

edit: oops 2.21 not 1.21"
I take it that the Vee sucks?
"Same. I’ve found that driving some of the faster formula cars, and then stepping back down into the F4 helps my lap times. Makes pushing it to the edge a little easier to feel. Or, like you can push it more without losing it. The super formula car is a damn rocket that requires such finesse to control. The F4 feels easy in comparison"
You can’t please everyone 😂 thankyou
"Never know. It's /iRacing, not /complainaboutiracingandnews"
Thank you 👍🏼
Not sure I have the pc specs for VR. Plus I’ve got no headset lol
"Yeah I’ll be sticking with the f4 for a while for sure. The f4 schedule looks much better then the gt4’s also. Mostly f1 type tracks which is what I prefer being an f1 fan. Also the f4 is nice and slow so you have more time to think compared to faster open wheelers.

Look forward to it mate 👍🏼"
"I look forward to F3 then, I’ll probably do a full season in F4 first"
"Top 3 is very good, considering the grid sizes. I make you right also, it does feel like a big go-kart"
"That’s it, just keep at it. It would be boring if it was easy"
"This is the clickbait of a lot of faster cars, they feel on rails at 80% (just made that # up), then you get into a group with pace and find that there is a lot more, but that last 20% is on edge and you find yourself spinning a lot more, or blowing apexes, but this is where the ""proper"" techniques everyone talks about come into play, while I am in no way great at any of them, I have begun to be able to feel when I get the car to rotate at the right point, and be able to power out of a corner a lot earlier than I used too.  I used to look at telemetry and not understand how people did what they did, and the simple answer is, they understand how to make the car turn with the brakes instead of the wheel. Great part is when you get a feel for it and go back to the slower cars, you'll be a lot faster in those too!"
"1:21, is that just the first sector?😉"
"I’m just scraping into the 2:23’s and I’m thinking the same thing. Spa is probably my most driven track, and I’m just slow on it apparently. Always 2-3 seconds back no matter the car."
"My PB is somewhere in the 2:21’s, and I’m nowhere near alien status, so take this advice with a grain of salt: whenever I come back to Spa I tend to be a couple of seconds off my historical pace at first, and where I lose that time is usually over-slowing the car through Bruxelles (10), No Name (11) and Fagnes/Campus (13/14).

It’s easy to think you should just brake harder and later, but being conscious of where I can carry more speed through corners without sacrificing my exit is usually where I make that time back. Keeping your speed up mid corner is just as important as where and how hard to brake.

It’s important to note though, everything is a compromise.

Also look at your BB if you haven’t already. Bringing it back from baseline will give you more braking performance because you recruit the rear tires more, which also makes trail braking more effective. I run 54,5, f.ex. It makes your rear more likely to step out under braking though, and IF you lock up, it’s more likely it’ll be the rears which is more risky than just locking the fronts.

I’m not a coach and I haven’t seen one of your full laps, so YMMV."
I didn’t enjoy it that much tbh
The Vee is great. It's low speed means it's easier to be competitive. Fernando Alonso loves to drive the Vee.
"Exactly that, I feel like you’ll have a lot more fun in the lower formulas"
"Well that’ll put a damper on that. I just picked up one last month, and while it’s got its drawbacks, racing in VR is the coolest thing ever."
Yeah i just went wide at the start took the 1x to avoid the carnage at turn 1 and scampered off. It has just the right amount of aero to power to be fun and controlled
Ah fuck I meant 2.21 😂
What’s the drawbacks out of interest?
That’s good tactic but I’d be scared of a slow down penalty lol
"The pc needed to run good looking stable VR is a little higher. Setting it up can be a bit of a process. Once it’s up and running, it’s usually good to go, though. The biggest thing would be the comfort. They’re not terribly uncomfortable, but you are wearing a headset strapped to your face, and it feels like such. 

All in all, the immersiveness and general happiness I’ve felt while racing VR makes it totally worth it. Don’t know that I can go back to flat screens. I’ve avoided so many instances that I would not have been able to on a flat screen. Humans and their brains are really good with depth perception."
Still better than a 3 minute tow. Plus you barely go off and just for a bit. Run wide and go up the hill
"https://preview.redd.it/ir2s0e0un8dc1.jpeg?width=2532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f8fe2dc6f5f46073c5341f9d27d17dc280ca69b

These are my PC specs, what do we reckon? I’ve never tried VR, so I have no idea what it would be like. I’m quite happy with my set up at the moment but also I can never get triples because I just don’t have the space for it"
"I'm not a super PC savy guy, so I'm not sure how that stacks up performance wise. You'd have to check some forums out and see what they recommend. If it's doable, the quest 2 is like $250, worth giving it a shot imo. I do plan to upgrade later, my PC is pretty strong so I can get a decent image, and I think I've pushed the Quest 2 to the best image that it can present. Quest 3 seems to fix most of the gripes I have"
I have an amd 6600 gpu and ryzen 5 3600x cpu and I exclusively play iracing in vr on a quest 2. You'll definitely be able to run it and if you find a headset reasonably priced I thinks it's very worth it.  The graphics are definitely worse but still serviceable.   I also haven't really spent any time trying to optimize them.  The extra immersion is worth it to me and I get so caught up in it that I don't really pay attention to the graphics.  When I go back to acc or dirt rally I miss being in vr
"Yeah I’m not too worried about graphics tbh, I have all mine set to low/medium already, so I can achieve most fps. It’s definitely something I’d consider for the future so thank you!"
Hey I’m interested!
What is your iRating and which time slot are you guys doing?
"If you still need a 4th let me know, daytona is one of my stronger tracks"
Hi there pal. Send me your discord.
"Mine is 1360 and other guys have irating of 1800.
We will be doing 12 gmt"
Can you send me your discord? Let's continue there.
Are you looking for people to do particular time slots or stints? I'm at 2.6k at the moment. Daytona is not a strong track for me.
No but should do clean laps and be safe.
What's your laptime by the way
Low 32s are my best in race trim.

Least impatient LMP3 driver
"I was about to post a stupid ""inb4 someone claims this is your fault"" but I see two people have actually already claimed that so ... lmfao"
Learning this track for the first time this week in a GT4 and I can already tell the races will be carnage.
"haha, I was in this race. You should've added an outside view of the whole shit show this caused. One impatient driver and 4-5 drivers taken out. Pretty sure the last place lmp3 went to 3rd due to this crash, lol."
man multi class is so hard.  you can do everything correctly and still have incidents like this.
"Lol. You’re so chill while being taken out. 

“Ohhh boy. That’s it.”

I would’ve tossed my steering wheel out of the cockpit and cursed them to hell. 

I have anger management problems when things happen out of my control. That’s why I hardly ever race anymore unfortunately. I have issues. And I talk too much. I see myself out now."
Damn you got yeeted. Good shit
LMP drivers try not to dive bomb GT4 drivers going up and down the mountain challenge (Impossible)
TIL you can have a delta bar during a race.
I completed one of these races with a 0x and finished p2 (bottom split) so I was feeling pretty good about myself. I then decided F4 at SPA would be a good next race (it was not).
The moment i saw this on the schelude i knew it was gonna be a shitshow.

"Be predictable bro, know whats behind you...................."
Unsarcastically as a new to sim racing person. Why is it not? This seems like every sim racing steward clip where the consensus is the lead car blindly followed the line and squeezed the trailing car
"It’s mostly survival. I passed 6 cars that wrecked before this incident, and they were all like 2-4k drivers too."
"Have been practicing and learning for 2 weeks and while I loved it, decided not to participate for the same reason. There is no way I will survive even one lap with my SoF 1600 racers"
"I had one last night that was squeaky clean. It *can* be done, if everyone's just a little patient"
It’s just the twisty section at the top. If someone crashes the whole thing gets blocked and there’s really no way to avoid it
"I was able to do the race yesterday evening with 0 inc in GT4. 
Well. I fucked up my qualification and start last. Finished 18. Still lost IR of course since I’m bad - but survive with 0 inc I think I deserve a medal or something "
My team took 4th just due to surviving one of the endurance races.
Yeah I’m pretty sure multiple cars got yeeted over the barriers
Hello fellow adhd racer :)
TAB by default. Also TAB to rotate between different reference laps for your delta. I never have it during races unless it's an endurance race and I'm going for a very specific consistent delta
"Yeah I have it set to one of my wheel buttons so I can cycle it, generally do best lap of session"
"I had 2 F4 races at Spa today and something strange with people there. It was extremely clean. I made something like 10-15 overtakes in total, several times was overtaken and not a single time there was something dangerous. Usually it's kills-kills-kills."
"I don’t know man. I watched your replay. That’s a tough corner for new-ish drivers to slam the brakes in, especially with that quick yellow flag. Think of it, you’re asking new-ish drivers to master the mountain.

But, still, keep slowing for incidents. It will catch eventually. I did for me, although every so often I still get boned."
"Absolutely yeah I could have lifted, but I was pretty committed to the corner long before he got along side 😂"
"He was already committed to the line and applied throttle before the P3 even showed a move, how is this on OP even in the slightest? To live looking in your mirrors after you've committed to an apex and acceleration point?"
"I dunno if you ever drove GT4's, but once you're comited to a line you can't change where you are going to exit the corner at that speed."
"Yes, but also it's the responsibility of the overtaking driver to pass safely.

So let's assess:

- Slower class cars approaching Brock's skyline to which all traffic uses the outside kerb due to the nature of the corner.
- Faster class car not alongside on the approach to the corner

Ah yes, the correct answer is torpedo through as if the slower class car doesn't exist.

Multi class racing goes both ways. Faster class drivers need to have a brain too."
"I was past the apex when he tried to pass, I couldn’t really have done much. 

Lift and we still would have hit, brake and I would have understeered into him, or at least have completely blocked the next car."
"How is this not predictable? He took the corner exactly how you should take the corner. 

Moving by reacting to what is behind you is unpredictable."
He couldn’t be more predictable.
Driving the racing line IS the most predictable thing he can do.
You’re borderline brain dead if you think OP is being unpredictable here lol
Are you the killer driver?
It's a bad idea in a racing subreddit to announce to everyone you clearly don't know how multiclass racing works
"He was predictable. Anyone who has driven one will know that the GT4 will drift out wide there and once you've committed to the corner there is very little that you can change. It was a dumb move by the LMP3.

This clip is a good advocation for drivers running both classes at some point so that they understand the characteristics of the other cars in scenarios such as this."
"Trailing car tried to occupy a space that was closing. Trailing car didn't account for the GT4 having less downforce, less mechanical grip and already having committed to the corner - which means any attempt to change line or brake would result in the GT4 crashing, because it is low on downfroce and low on mechanical grip. In essence, the LMP3 driver pretended the GT4 has the same capabilities as the LMP3 - it in fact does not.

It's one thing to be side by side through a corner, it's another thing to come from far back and attempt to occupy the outside line in a corner where a lower downforce car is naturally (and cannot possibly avoid!) entering that line momentarily.

Also, Simracingstewards is frequently, often severely, wrong in their so-called ""consensus""."
That’s good to hear. I’m down to low 2:19’s but race pace would like be more around 2:21-2:22 to stay on the track.
"ROFL yeah I lost the back end just before the dipper didn’t hit a wall but felt like Austin powers making a 50pt turn to get back going

![gif](giphy|y6Sl42U3xEFkk)"
a blessing and a curse
"Funny story. I actually went to the doctor yesterday because I’m super positive I have adhd. Guess what. He rather things I have a form of autism. Guess I will find out in a few months. 

I might have both. Fml."
"when I was starting out, I found it very useful to find where I loosing/gaining time during a race. When you reach a consistent pace, I'd turn it off as chasing fastest laps eventually led to crashes."
"you guys can reach your keyboards from your sim rigs?

i rely on asking my girlfriend to press buttons for me lol"
"I’ve been in your shoes, it does get better! For me, I was diagnosed and treated for adhd but always suspected there could be some autism in the mix. There is so much overlap in co-morbidities that it’s been tough to figure out where one stops and the other starts. 

Best of luck in your future, you got this."
"Oh I've been there. After the first Alt + Tab you'll soon move on to wheel shortcuts, I guarantee."
Thanks and I noticed there are many co-morbidities indeed. The worst part is I’ve been creating coping strategies all my life. That makes it even more difficult to figure out what’s really going on in my head.
"Your problem doesn’t sound like a technical one.

Over driving is caused by you attempting to drive the car at a speed beyond your capabilities, this causes you to make mistakes. It may be one big mistake or lots of small errors which add up over the course of a lap.

Another big mistake a lot of people make is making an error early in the lap watching their delta bar go red and then attempting to drive faster to make it go green again. This is possibly the worst thing you can do. If fact I suggest turning your delta bar off and removing any other possible distractions including HUD, crew chief etc. 

The next thing you should is only concentrating on the thing you need to be doing exactly next. 

So if your going down the straight say to yourself 

- next braking marker

Then 

- apex 
 
Then 

- exit point

Then 

- racing line

That way you’re only concentrating on one thing at a time. This will become intuitive after a while.

The last thing I suggest is driving to a delta, by looking at your lap time on the straight each lap, not by the delta bar.

If your best lap time is say 1.32, drive to hit 132.5 each lap. Even 1.33 This way you back off a little each lap which takes you into a zone where not likely to make mistakes. 

It also has a range of other benefits including managing tyre wear and mental fatigue. 

Also by driving to a delta you’ll often find you go faster. This is because you are not making mistakes and enter into ‘the zone’. It’s often why you hear race engineers tell their drivers to slow down and the driver complains because they can’t go any slower. 

You will most likely be faster over the course of a race this way. 

Doing 1.32 then several 1.34s / 1.35s because of mistakes is always going to be slower."
"You might be overheating your tires, pay attention to your tire FX sound to hear if they are scrubbing hard when you corner.  Adjust your driving to depend less on your front tires to steer and brake the car."
".... you know you are overdriving but have tried a list of things that have nothing to do with over driving?

brake less, throttle up smoother, and steer less/smoother. theres really not much more too it.  Its easier said than done but seriously none of your list will fix the fact you are holding onto the gas too long, braking too hard to compensate, and likely oversteering to compensate too.

easiest way for myself to stop over driving is to ""fuel save"". lift 5m early. brake at the same spot. first time through you will over slow. next time lift 5m early, brake a bit less, and steer a bit less. once you get that down, dont lift for 5m then brake. lift and brake a bit sooner but immediately brake just at a lower amount."
"Are you over driving or losing focus?

Over driving to me would be trying to drive faster than you are capable of. Which I'm not sure what to say besides, ""don't do that"". 

Focus on the other hand...

You mentioned your first laps are your best, which is when I'd assume you are the most focused. 

Makes me wonder if the issue is that you lose focus and then drive poorly while trying to make up for mistakes -- eg you miss your brake marker but try to hit the apex like you normally would anyway."
I found gripping the wheel loosely helped.
"I would guess that it’s a mixture of your mental game and the cars losing grip over time. 

I’d recommend going to race a bunch of oval races and see if/when it happens there. I say ovals because it’s more condensed with the same corners over and over again and is much more rhythmic than a road course. The ovals will force you to focus on your precision and accuracy more to achieve consistent lap times over the course of a run. If you go a little deep in one corner your exit is compromised and the next corner entry will be compromised too. I kinda say you have to “Drive within the car” and you have to be in control of it at all times and not let it drive itself."
"A good trick is to practice fuel saving, big lifts before braking zone. Will force you to be smooth."
"The basic thing you are missing is precise brake marker.

You mentioned braking harder or softer, but in relation to what... you must use a brake marker and adjust your braking distance, not your brake pressure. Overdrive comes from braking too late. As soon as you miss an apex, your first place to look at is whether you braked at the proper spot."
"Turn off your HUD. Entirely. 
Do not track your lap times. 
Now just drive the car. Don’t try to get the best lap time. Just drive the car slowly. 

Now build speed, slowly, slow enough to stay on the perfect line. Now get faster and faster. Staying on the perfect line. 

If at any point you can’t stay on line, note that section of track and figure out why. 
Are you breaking too hard, not enough?
Is the weight of the car in the wrong place."
"The best, and perhaps the only way, is too simply slow down.  

You're trying to drive beyond your abilities, so stop doing it."
Try driving slower and relaxing your inputs. Go for smooth not aggressive and fast. The faster you try to go the slower youll be. And vice versa
I think this might be my problem. Appreciate your insight.
"Hmm that’s a good question. It could be a little of both. The reason I say overdriving is because of the tires, it also feels like am 1 mph away from an off track or losing control. I don’t know how to describe the feeling other than it kinda feels like am sliding through a corner even though am not,  TC isn’t on or ABS."
"That sounds like a good idea , I’ll give it a go. Thanks"
"That's just driving on the limit; especially in cars like the MX5, vee, formula Ford.

Losing focus, for me, would be missing brake points, missing apexes etc"
"I am guilty of both for sure but my only thing is I always thought driving at the limit was a good thing, like am extracting all the car has to offer but am 1-2 sec behind pace. Which makes me push harder leading to missed braking points or incorrect turn ins. I also moved up a split so there’s the fact that everyone is faster than me lol"
As long as the teams are in different time slots there won't be a problem. You just have to be selected as driver
"When the team is registered, drivers are selected for who will be driving the car. Just make sure you are only selected as a driver for the one team you will be driving for. Being on multiple teams is not an issue. Most people belong to many teams. You can practice the registration in the official practice sessions going on right now. It works the same way. You will see the ""Add Driver"" section."
"That's my issue. Both teams are running the same time slot. 
What if both teams register me? Will that screw up my ability to sign up as a driver either the team I am driving with? Or should I just leave the other team?"
""" It is possible that multiple teams declare the same driver for their team. The decision of which team to drive for is ultimately left to the driver. Registering for one team will lock that driver in for the session and they will no longer be able to drive for the other team. The team that declared that driver but did not have him race will then fail to meet the Fair Share Rule. Declaration of the correct drivers is something left to the user that registers the team.  "" &#x200B; This is from the iracing support page about team racing. the only thing i'm not sure about is if all splits are seen as one session or all individual sessions. but if you got into the same split then you certainly wouldn't be able to race for both
But i wouldn't risk it either way"
HPD
the LMP2 is by far my favorite road car on iRacing. Sad thing is it has poor participation in the IMSA series
"Highly, highly recommend LMP2. While all the YouTube followers are in LMP3 and GTP, LMP2 hangs out with cool friends at great parties, does the electric slide perfectly, and is very talented in the bedroom."
"Caddy, Porsche, BMW, Acura. This is how I’d describe them in terms of how easy they are drive with the easiest being the Caddy IMO. Obviously just for GTP. Personally though I recommend you start with the LMP3 and work your way up."
"I started with LMP3, then LMP2, now GTP (did a season of each, currently in GTP season).  LMP2 is the best in my opinion, and most fun to drive.  LMP3 is hardest to drive (brakes are touchy), LMP2 the easiest. GTP is the most popular, followed by LMP3 in it's separate series, and the LMP2 has minimal participation but you still get multiple splits in LMP2 Fixed, but in IMSA the splits aren't always great.

Downside of GTP is you only race it in multi-class via IMSA Open or Fixed.  LMP2 and LMP3 you can race in single make in their Fixed series."
"I can only speak for GTP as it’s my most driven class. I’d say if I were to recommend any car from GTP, it will probably be the Cadillac. I’m disregarding the current BoP state at the moment because its always subject to change, but the Caddy is the safest to drive imo, Porsche is punishing on the brakes, Acura is just unenjoyable to me, and whilst the BMW is my favourite, it’s a little less forgiving than the Caddy"
The HPD has been a lot of fun. make sure you stay in front the Corvettes. Do not start from the pits on this one.
"In regards to toxicity, multiclass which both of those can be used for can get pretty toxic, but it's some of the most intense and most fun racing you can have. You can use the LMP3s on their own (no GT4s) in the fixed series. IMSA races have pit stops whereas LMP3 races don't. Regarding popularity, both are pretty popular, IMSA is probably more so tho. IMSA races are longer than LMP3 races. Getting a GTP car will allow you to participate in the IMSA-style special events. I will also leave a recommendation to get the HPD, it's (I think) still only 3$ and it's super fun to drive, with the revival of the Proto/GT series it usually has a good few sign-ups, but you may end up in HPD-only races depending on your irating. But honestly, just drive what you enjoy the most and don't worry about toxic people."
"Personally, the lmp3 is the most difficult for me. GTP all drive very similar, so pick the one that makes your pp hard. 
İf you got more time on your hands, you could watch ""Win the weekend"" by IMSA on YouTube, and just go with the team you want to support. 

Lmp2 feels amazing to drive, but participation took a hit, so lobbies might be challenging. 

HPD is awesome, but I think GTP is probably more future proof."
"LOVE the LMP2, though it seems to have gone full Jan Brady of late."
"You specifically pointed out at the end ""most driveable"". I would say the Caddy GDP fits that the best. It is effortless to drive and is currently the most balanced GDP."
"I only drive LMP2 because of how fun the car is. There’s mostly only 1 split of LMP2s in IMSA each race (or 2 occasionally) so you’re put up against all different kinds of irating from 6k- 1k if it’s all one split. Personally I like it, but others might not."
So went and jumped into the Lmp3. Mostly out of impulse lol. I thought I knew mount panorama well but it's a whole new beast in this car
"I started with The BMW, went to cadi and enjoyed it alot, tried porsche and meh'd it (although I only ran it on daytona and not that much, so I'm more neutral to it)

went back to the BMW and loved it to the fullest, but
overall it depends on your driving style. I think the reason I like the BMW more than the cadi is because of its stability, and it doesnt have brake bias migration. Althought that can be turned off so it shouldnt make a problem"
Lmp2. Not as popular as it once was but the car is fantastic. And being the middle class means you get to pass people and be passed.
"The lmp2 is my favorite. It has good participation. Ut not quite as hectic as GTP or HPD. I absolutely freaking love it. 

The caddy is awesome. GTP tends to be hectic though so play your cards how you want.

The HPD is amazingly fun. The sessions are horrendous and filled with stuff that is just....well sometimes its dumb. The draft is so OP in the HPD its broken in a sense.

Tldr: lmp2 is my fav but my opinion is heavily based off of what the sessions are like and not as much off od how the xar drives"
Such a shame the numbers aren’t racing the LMP2 anymore.  Great car to drive and to race in
"race multiclass in the LMP3 for some weeks, if you feel comfortable working through traffic cleanly, move up to IMSA, your choice if GTP or LMP2, the p2 just has less participation. For GTPs, coming from GTs, I'd say go caddy, easiest to drive and the least 'unique' of the four. Plus it goes vroom.
There's also the HPD and the old nissan GTP, but those series have less participation than IMSA.

-My favourite prototype to drive is the old GTP that's running with the audi GTOs, but participation is why I don't usually race it. And ultimately, I like racing the acura GTP more than the nissan, even if it is 'less fun' to drive"
"Whatever you’re comfortable with. I love every single class, but I mainly stick with GTP and LMP2 now. It depends on whether I’m in the mood to pass, or pass/be passed."
"Excellent choice,  lots of fun to drive,  popular series, and it's legacy t content so it's dirt cheap."
I love that this is the most upvoted answer.  No details.  Just buy it.  You will not regret it.
"I've wondered how this happened since the LMP3 got added when I was on a hiatus from the service. It boggles my mind, the LMP2 used to be such a popular car, and its also my favorite prototype."
![gif](giphy|CDJo4EgHwbaPS|downsized)
"Plus, with the Caddy, you get that beautiful Naturally Aspirated V8"
"The Cadillac is probably the easiest for a GT specialist to adapt to. Compared to the other GTPs, it's got a little bit less downforce, slightly softer suspension, and a more linear power curve due to the naturally aspirated engine. Those three traits make it just a little bit closer to a GT car in how it responds to being driven. 

I'm more of an open wheel/prototype specialist myself, and I find the Porsche and Acura easier to drive than the Cadillac with my driving style. My high-downforce instincts are to try and get back to full throttle as soon as possible in the corner, and the turbo lag on the Porsche and especially the Acura let me do so more easily without lighting up the rear tires. When I drive the Cadillac, my lead foot ends up roasting the rears and I progressively struggle more and more for rear grip over the course of a run. (Yes, this is a skill issue on my part.)"
That's not a downside. Multiclass is so much more fun!
I've done a fair bit of multiclass already albeit not in an lmp. Might just jump in the deepend with the gtp's. The porsche felt proper fast
"The LMP3 can be frustrating because it is feels like the rears are always begging to lock up, but man when you get it right it is a lot of fun to drive."
Where do you get setups for it?
LMP2 was popular when it was the top class IMSA car.  Now we have the GTPs.
"A lot of my friends who used to race LMP2 jumped to LMP3 because the car and the racing were more fun. A lot more jumped to GTP once the Caddy came out and the BMW was no longer a deathtrap. The LMP2 is good, but it's older and has become less interesting to drive after the big power nerf."
😂
"I agree, but to some it might be “too much going on” as they dip their toe into prototypes. It’s what drew me in, personally, but figured it was worth mentioning as an objective data point."
"In that case, there’s already a comment on this post that’s pretty good in regards to the GTP class"
"The discord for the Proto GT Series has setups for every week in there, they‘re pretty good and depending on your driving style, you could extract tons of time out of them

Another big up is Garage61 which lets you download setups from other drivers (IF THEY HAVE IT ENABLED, setups from shops are locked) and it‘s a great place to compare telemetry and see what setup changes others have made. One thing you have to watch out for, some setups are with Quali fuel so double check!!"
"I have no clue tbh

Edit: Just looked, and Majors Garage has a good amount of setups for it."
Where do you get setups for anything? That’s something I’ve not even tried to do for iRacing. Oddly enough.
"I appreciate your response, I purchased the car and had no clue where to get setups. Cheers!"
You got your cars a bit mixed up. Those are gt3 not gte. And it's the gt3 fanatec challenge
"Indycars at Nords is such a fun, albeit tough, combo. It's about an hour long race, on a tricky track that punishes mistakes severly, with no TC or ABS and noticeable tyre deg, and two pitstops."
Man the IndyCar logos seem so weird on the DW-12 now. I got too accustomed to seeing that space blank.
How do we know that's Verstappen?
"I did the Indy fixed race there a few weeks ago which was 4 or 5 laps I think. I don't have the grip strength to be clenching the wheel for 9 laps.

Also I'm not sure that counts as photo evidence since his name doesn't appear."
Those cars look sweet.
Indy is at Nords this week?
"Started behind him in the 18:00 GMT slot, he just rocketed away at the start, was obvious he's gonna win it tbf"
"I was spectating this race and clipped his first lap on alternates live, really really fast stuff. https://streamable.com/1bac2k"
What series is this in? I feel like this combo would be a ton of fun lol
"I was there also, a bit behind."
A wins a win 🤝
GG.  Gotta take the W where it can be found. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)
So you lost.
"Before he had its second account I managed to beat his time at Le Mans by around 1 second.

In a faster class. -\_-"
"Seems like it was likely Jos, I was in a practice session with him in this combo today when Max also popped in for a few moments"
"there's no proof at all, all of these cars could be anyone."
"SCHLEIFE it´s called NORDSCHLEIFE!!!!!!!1111111oneleven :flip\_out:

Sorry couldn´t hold on me this time :DBut Nords sound soooooooo wrong.Nordschleife means Northloop. And ""nords"" is like u say ""Northl"" in english. Please don´t castrate Tracknames like this. I saw this on another track took and it looks ridiculous.

Sorry again for the rage. Just me and my .5 Cents."
"Max is slowest driver, anyway... İdk why everyone say he is fast duck."
"I actually finished higher than NASCAR Xfinity driver Connor Mosack in A Fixed (nascar) at Homestead once, although that's because he crashed out"
"Don't complain, 2 weeks ago it was stock cars at Nord's....."
So… even Max doesn’t race the WL13?
"Are you listening, Roger?"
"I think a 1 stop is doable, no?"
Does Max still regularly play iRacing? Does he stream?
I still don’t know why the NTT Data IndyCar Series logo isn’t being used.
"Its not Verstappen. It’s _Jos_ Verstappen.

Na jokes aside, was in qualifying and saw him there already doing a 3x and quit haha 

Then, when I actually x‘d myself, I wanted to do something else, but it came to my mind that he might to the next race and it will maybe be one split.

Unluckily there were two and I just suck and so got put into second split where he was in the first.

He completely destroyed everybody except the second place, who had a 4 second gap to Verstappen till the end.

Max had no real practice before."
"My tower of lies is unravelling, I need to flee to Mexico and take on a new name...

It'll be tough to flee to Mexico of course, being based on the wrong side of the Atlantic"

"He was racing, OPs most likely not lying"
"Yeah, bought it for that reason (plus figuring participation would trend back up with the licensing returning)"
"You'll be in the background then, as this is from that race. I last saw him as we turned off the GP course for the first time. I think you passed me around the outside on T2"
"Jeeez, he’s able to find more lateral grip on those cold tyres at full fuel than I could find when they’re up to temperature in quali trim. It’s a frankly annoying amount of talent"

"If you look at the last indycar race top split, max was there. And he got 1st unsurprisingly"
"OP is lying.  I'm actually the car in the center. The black #1 car is Michael Schumacher. The car on the right is Verstappen. And I beat them both. They later messaged me and told me that I was way ahead of their league.

It's also hard to see but towards the back is Ayrton Senna. And Greg Moore is mixed in there somewhere."

Least bias Mazepin fan
😭😭WHAT 
Has to be an awful troll right?
That was fine as long as you submitted your request to brake at least 3 full business days before reaching the corner. Also the HPD and GT1s were there on the same week
"I am, and don't call me ~~Shirley~~ Roger"
"Maybe with some clever and extreme fuel saving? I only get like 3.5 laps out of a tank driving at 100%, and to one-stop you're looking at pulling off a 5-lap stint. I imagine you can 1-stop it on tracks where the lap is much shorter and you don't need about 20L a lap"
"1 stop is doable when it's 8 laps like last time around indycar was here. This time it's 9 laps, and 1 stop is not really feasible"
He doesn't stream much but can be found on the Team Redline channel.  He does race a ton though.
Now that you say that I realize that that’s actually the wrong logo for the nosecone - it really HAS been a long time…
"I've found a niche recently lapping very fast downforce cars over a long stint at a just barely okay pace without crashing (mostly), taking me from 1400s to 1900s since the start of the latest season. Nurburgring in particular seems to suit me! I was just the other side of the split, and the 2nd slowest qualifier, so Max started behind me as he was the highest rated non-qualifier."
"> It’s

Bullshit if it was Jos then he would have been doing the beating and OP is clearly a guy."
It was a joke.
"Yup, i am in the dark red car (i have my own Pink Livery on you can see in [this](https://gyazo.com/73c7edf72d70b689f8600d63ccae97f2) or on another car, [this](https://gyazo.com/7da669a43921b064d2c4df105f867a06) picture

Was a great race besides me unfortunately smashing into someone that slowed down mid carousel and i went into him, always great seeing real life drivers aswell"
I think he did a 6:49 or so on his third(!!!!) lap on the reds
"Not to mention his third laps on reds. I've been stretching one of the black stints to 4 laps just to save myself from the hell that is lap 3 on reds. 

In one race earlier this week I was more or less forced into doing 3 laps on reds and that third lap was something else, I've never felt like I was hanging on for dear life like ththat before and my pace dropped off accordingly. Absolutely mindblowing to then watch Max looking just as ragged on that third lap but somehow finding blistering pace anyway. All this with barely no practice, just a great example of how good he really is"
"At Nordschleife and boi is it fun, some corners are just nuts, like tripple righthander"
What SR is that? Sounds like a blast.
"It’s clearly his dads‘ 

/s"
As I said though both Max and Jos were in the practice session together. This race was about 45 minutes later. I guess Max could of swapped over but I doubt it
There's me in P7!!
Keep scrolling down the standings for about 30 minutes and you'd see me too!
He races under his dads name?
B license? #washed
"still no proof. won't hold up in court.  
Hasn't even Max' name, but his dads."
Without practice.
hahaha nice :D

What’s your vector victor
What's your clearance Clarence?
"Last time they did this car/track combo for the Open series it was 8 laps, and the winner in my race did 1-stop it, cause stretching a 3.5/3.7 lap tank into 4 laps isn't that difficult (I can't, but plenty of people can).

But stretching that tank to 5 laps would be a monumental feat."
"Man I don’t want to imagine having a formula one champion sitting behind me, I think that I would just lock my wheels into T1"
What was his laptime?
"Nice livery - unfortunately trading paints seemed to be making my PC crash on certain tracks, so I got rid of it as it wasn’t worth the risk of DNFs"
"I’ve been doing 2 lots of 3 laps on the softs, and reluctantly sticking on the hards on at the end while I watch everyone drive away.

While it gets sketchy after the carousel on the third lap on the softs, I found it quicker to spend as much time on the softs as possible"
"Road B, but basically everyone other than Max was A in top split.

It is a blast, but also a grind. You need to be pretty sure of your consistency to sign up to over an hour of lapping the ring in a 700hp 735kg car without TC and with noticeable tyre degradation."
Yes it's his alt for fun racing. His Max account needs to stay stratospherically high iR for special events.
Yeah its his alt
"He did do like 20 minutes of practice, which he really needed because it looked like he was on the default set. It's a very solid set but it was built for fixed earlier this season and as such was a bit heavy on the downforce to make the car better to drive for newcomers.

He figured out pretty quickly to adjust it after getting smoked in the flat out parts in practice, and adjusted the setup for the race. He also just straight up improved his driving lap by lap at a level I've never seen before, and proceeded to demolish some absolute legends who drive this car all the time. His world champion level of talent was so incredibly obvious to see to anyone deeply familiar with this car"
Huh?
"Maybe if you turn off the engine for the downhills, and make the other cars bump draft you up this hills?"
"I was on top-split pole yesterday for my first ever Indycar race as only one other person had bothered with quali, even though I had the lowest iRating in the field and way-off the fast guy's pace. I actually did lock-up into T1, over-rotated and caused a crash, I think with an 8000 rated Williams e-Sports driver. Naturally nerves were bad today for a possible repeat with Max."
"I think his fastest race lap was a 6:49, while I think mine was about 7:02. Quali times seem to be about 5+ seconds quicker due to the low fuel along with fresh soft tyres"
Fastest lap of Verstappen was 6:48.6 where 2nd place had a 6.48.2
Crazy to think Max's alt/burner account is still 8k iR
"Airplane! (alternatively titled Flying High!)[5] is a 1980 American comedy film written and directed by the brothers David and Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams in their directorial debuts,[6] and produced by Jon Davison. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson.[6] It is a parody of the disaster film genre, particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, from which it borrows its plot, central characters, and some dialogue.[7][8] It also draws many elements from Airport 1975 and other films in the Airport series. It is known for its use of surreal humor and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns, gags, running jokes, and dark humor."
You cannot restart an indycar without an external starter (I don't know if you can or can't bumpstart it) so you'd need to be smart about it
Lol that is insane. You’re living the sim racing dream right now.
"Reads like a charm. Professional driver take out Round 2!

I better be getting back to 2k, but Nordschleife again helped me get my A back!

Hopefully we’ll not take us out on track lol"
Bad bot
What?
You can turn the engine on and off if your button is mapped. I have it mapped and have hit it mid race accidentally more than once.
"In real life they can bumpstart it if they stall.

In iRacing cars will never stall, and Indycars can be restarted on their own."
Wrecking the pros?
Not a bot lol

Sounds like something a bot would say
I'm so confused now
Beep beep boop boop
skill issue 
You don't have to update what you don't want to update in the UI. I'm confused.
You spent more energy on this post than it takes to press “update”
Yeah that sounds like you just.... didn't... unselect those updates? You don't have to do them.
"You're right! The update was so stupid, why do I need to download the ""required update"", when I don't know what it is but I know I don't need it! I mean, it was only 100mb and took 20 seconds, but I don't ever plan agead so I can't believe they force us to do this. Just let us race!!!!

/s. 

Don't play the game if you can't select ""required only"" from a drop menu. It's not that hard man."
Required/Not required.
I didn’t download anything but the mandatory stuff. Sounds like you had stuff selected that wasn’t required.
Just update the thang. It takes like no time
Agreed  the UI is utter arse compared to the Web page. So much harder to navigate. Really miss the drop down box of the website and easy access to whatever you needed.
"Oh you know what, I figured out OP's issue:  


From the notes:  
   
`Updater`  
`A handful of Rookie cars and tracks are now part of the “Required” downloads. This is to ensure a customer always has both a track and vehicle available on their machine for troubleshooting purposes, as well as in preparation for a New User Onboarding experience coming soon! These items include:`  
`- - Formula Vee`  
`- - Street Stock`  
`- - Lime Rock Park`  
`- - USA International Speedway`  
 

Most people on the service have all cars downloaded to begin with; it's often suggested in beginners guides. And most people download every track they own + all the free tracks.  


It looks like iRacing has indeed added some Rookie class stuff to required downloads. My guess, given their statement about troubleshooting issues, is that support has had to deal with folks who don't have any content downloaded not being able to figure out the game.  


This still has absolutely nothing to do with the new UI. This would've been required even if you were still using the web launcher. And frankly, I'm not sure why you didn't have any of that content downloaded anyway. Why not have everything downloaded to begin with? That way when the service is down for maintenance, you can use testdrive to test cars you don't own."
"Yeah, this is operator error. I guess you didn’t see the checkboxes on the selection screen"
"Yup, op just needs to unchecked update all and select what he wants or download what he wants after the mandatory updates."
"How do I skip the required updates screen then?

I launch the app and it says Required Updates then forces me to hit download, or exit the app."
I spent more energy on this post than iracing did on QA.
Except I did.
It literally doesn't work though?
"I didn't though?

It forcibly checked stuff under required that I don't race."
"It would be hard to argue that the UI is worse or harder to navigate than the website.  


You're mistaking your experience and comfort for a better design. You're more familiar with the website; but in time you'll learn to use the UI and will likely find it works much better (as most people who have already switched have found)."
"Yeah that's what I'm doing though and it will still make me do required updates before accessing anything in the app, and those updates are often not for things I'm racing."
"There are required updates. That has always been true. 

There are also optional updates. You can uncheck those. 

However, those are generally quite small unless you’ve bought a new car and need to download it. IIRC, the Dallara P217 update was literally kilobytes. 

The bulk of your update was the required update and that has nothing to do with the new UI. You’ve always needed to connect to races with an up to date client. Website or no website."
Your life just be incredibly easy if the UI is such a challenge.
Then how did some of us manage to do updates without downloading unnecessary content?
"How is that a hard argument to make? 
Website has the easy to see drop down menu. Or a nicely   scaled up coming page.
Ui has a page filled with stupidity large icons or a backwards menu and no ability to just scroll to a list that's in order"
Yes we all need to do required updates or the app won’t work properly. That’s what required means.
"There were a couple of rookie cars that have been added to required content. The vast majority of us download all cars, even cars we don't own. I guess OP didn't and is mad that the list of required downloads was increased."
Hey buddy would you like to join our team? For the daytona. We will be driving GTP mostly cadillac. We are a team of 2 right now and looking for more. And we run for 12.00 GMT.
I’m interested in this too!

I ran a g2 on much worse. 5600x 3070 16gb and it was fine. just had to lower settings which im sure you'll be able to raise a few
"I just started using a quest 2 with a 5600x CPU and a 5700xt video card.

Graphics fairly low but it runs fine!"
I run iRacing with my quest 2 on a 3070 with fairly high setting with consistent 120 fps
I run a G2 on an i5 6600k and a 1080ti. Turned the graphics down as per the guide on the forums and use FSR in balanced mode and I get 80-90fps in most situations. Not perfect but perfectly comfortable for long sessions. Your PC should be fine I reckon.
"If you’re on triple 1440p, then VR is easier to run than those"
"You will get it to run ok but may have to be on medium to low settings. TBH even on high spec systems you couldn’t turn everything up to full. 

Go for it and when you are hooked you can upgrade 😂"
G2 is pretty much the same as a Q3 I guess I should be fine
Virtual desktop?
Is it less taxing on your system via quest link ? Sorry first time vr user
That’s what I figured. I kept getting mixed responses some people were making it sound like my system is obsolete for a quest 3
That’s fine I didn’t expect it to run at the highest settings. Even if you crank the settings on iRacing it doesn’t look the nicest anyways lol.
"No, quest link"
No idea
Hardware snobs. I run quest 3 on ryzen 1600 and 1650 super. Granted I have to make visual sacrifices but it works
Felt like the typical pc master race it’s either max settings or don’t bother running it on pc at all. Made it sound like my 3090ti is a 750lol
"That's what happens when you put on a pair of old shoes after walking around in a pair of new boots. Everything fits right, you're more comfortable, and you're getting your groove on.

Nice kill."
Well done mate!
"Of course, I think I might have just happened to been in the sweet spot in terms of SOF...

I wasn't on the front row, but I was on the pace, and managed to pull ahead and run away with it, hitting multiple fastest laps.

I'm still two seconds off from the top split, though.

To clarify, this isn't my first win, but all my others have been in F1600 and Vee."
Thanks.
Bruh you can message people via the forums
These posts remind me of Craigslist's Missed Connections.
"I love these posts and wonder how often the intended person sees them. 

To the guy in the GT4 race last night in the Jif PB and J car, I saw you get spun out and then try (unsuccessfully) to murder your attacker as he passed by. That was bold. Much like the bold taste of a Jif peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
"It's ok!

&#x200B;

(jk it wasn't me)"
I was today years old when I learned this.
"For some reason, a lot of people you can’t. Or at least when I try, their name doesn’t always show up. It seems like it’s 50/50."
"They should really integrate that in the ui though.
I also learned from the forum message a while ago, but I am never on the forum like many so messages will probably not be read."
I looked at the forums for the first time in 3 years the other day.   I had a bunch of messages that I had no clue were there.
"Someone made a post and video about some dude who wrecked him, I was that dude"
"I dont know if he will ever see it. In different parts of the race, we were both in the wrong, he could have easilly protested me on lap 5, and I could have done the same on lap 9. 

Ultimatly, him and I both had a 10 second lead on the third place car so we were well ahead and both racing hard. It was a TON of fun. my average lap time was about half a second faster than his best, but his defence was not something I could go up against. Id try to pass on the inside before a corner and he would follow me all the way to the other side of the track and screw up both of our lines. 

We both made mistakes, probably swapped places 3-4 times. It was intense, the best race Ive had so far, even if I finished 7th after the pit."
"FYI they won’t get a notification of your message unless they’re subscribed to the particular email type, so I wouldn’t count on them receiving it."

good job!
Thank you ! Is the First year for te team in iracing but sounds very good
"iRacing simulates damage caused by misuse. It just doesn’t simulate “bad luck” mechanical failures (like punctures). But you can definitely blow a gearbox, send an engine to the moon by downshifting at too high of a speed (if the car doesn’t have the ability to refuse to shift if the speed isn’t appropriate), etc."
"Burning out the clutch was a real issue with the 991 Porsche Cup, standing start clutch dump done wrong and you'd had to tow to the pits.  It got patched at some point but that's when I learned about clutch damage being simulated."
"Dude, the amount of blown engines with stock cars on road courses during last W13 was hilarious. Everyone that disabled the assists and had no clue how to drive those cars blew their engine at some point. Blew two engines myself. Really nice feature."
"Yes, you right, we agree that in sims shouldn't be mechanical failures by default. But in real life, if you misbehave with the tires, they can be damaged , causing a flat spot and vibrations in the wheel (like AC simulates if you brake too hard with open wheels specially) , lead to a flat tyre, or directly destroy them. That's what i mean, iRacing doesn't punish you for push too much that limit."
I managed to do it once with the 992. But that was in a practice session
It’s extra fun when you miss 3rd gear on a restart from p1 at Daytona. The only solution I found was to start yelling “I’M SORRY” while I try to get low and not get ran over. I like to light a Burnt Clutch Candle for extra realism.
"This is on the To-Do in [DRE](https://getdre.app).

When implemented, you can say to DRE via Push-To-Talk:

""Write to sim hello there"" and it will type in ""hello there\* or whatever you fancy to speak.

I recently had another request for this, so I might bump up the priority on this?"
"Hey - I race using the Quest 2, it is likely because of you running OpenXR.iRacing has a dedicated Quest mode, which is pretty much required on the Meta headsets for the game to run smoothly without running into these issues.

I had the exact same issue before I switched to that mode, just open the Quest Link, use the quest's desktop view to start iracing and you should be good to go  


Edit: This is outdated info, OpenXR is meant to work flawlessly"
"It is?

I just started in VR and grabbed open xr because everyone said it makes it run smoother."
I’ll give that a try! Thank you.
I run iracing via openXR/virtual desktop and have never had any of these issues. Additionally virtual desktop just seems to be less finicky than airlink/oculus mode.
Wait really? My quest 2 runs and looks 1000x better on OpenXR. Every time Ive used the default Oculus mode it’s all super jittery with blur and constant frame drops. Id love to know your specs and settings
That's good to know - how do you run virtual desktop through the quest? I was never able to get it running properly and I just assumed it wasn't meant to be.
"Wait, seriously? I have to try it then, for me it was always really buggy but maybe I did something wrong? Are you just launching the game in OpenXR?  
Edit: For me it always gave me issues, but the last time I tried it was 2 or so years ago, so maybe it was just a bad driver"
"Most of the settings are pretty pc/router dependent - but the things I think worked well across people are having a dedicated router (would also help for air link), having ethernet (not wifi) connection between router and PC, and using VDXR as the runtime (instead of Automatic/Steam VR)"
I’d definitely try it again. I almost gave up on VR iRacing because the default oculus looked so bad until someone recommended openXR to me. Literally all I did was choose OpenXR on the “Launch Sim” page and it worked perfectly. No messing with setting or anything.
"You were absolutely right, my game's never looked better or ran smoother. Thank you"
"Thanks, will try it!"
Hell yeah man. Glad I could help and happy motorin’!
"Hey Man, I have the merc GT3 but ill buy a new car if needed and I need a partner. I'm also down for any shift but we'll probably need a third person. Feel free to DM."
"It's a track most know very well. Also, people have been practicing for more than a month. I saw 24 hour practice hosted sessions mid-December."
"Daytona, Spa, Monza, Le Mans (to an extent), the big name tracks that every racing game has will see a population boost in the series (and therefore, tighter splits), and they'll be much better prepared for it. 

Especially Daytona, cause its easy to drive with massive draft to compensate struggles and has a 24 hour event and has been everywhere these last 3 weeks."
"The iracing 24 is the biggest most prestigious simracing event that’s open to public registration. 

It attracts much of the best drivers around. "
"Mid 45s at what track temp? How much fuel? Watch some lap guides on Youtube, there are tons of them"
Daytona is deceptively simple but there's a bunch of ways to lose and gain time. I've done several 24s there and umpteen sprints and enduros and I'm still learning little things here and there.
"There are many who do IRL racing most of the year and only hop on iracing for the big enduros. You’ll find a decent chunk of these folks will be faster than VRS time in VRS weather and suddenly it seems like the lobbies are full of stupid fast people, because they are"
"1. People practice a shit ton for the event so they tend to be fast

2. A ton of people who otherwise barely run officials (sticking to leagues and such) enter races to practice, and because they don't do officials, they're much faster than their iR suggests"
"You should be using a low downforce setup in Daytona, and make sure you master the corner before the oval, and the bus stop."
"Mid 45s is pretty fast if you ask me!! Especially if you are doing those with a 100L setup! Yesterday I did practice and didn’t even manage to get into the 45 myself. So don’t beat yourself up, you are pretty competitive. It’s all about consistency and not taking damage anyway. 24H is a looooooong race. I’m also hovering around 2K myself so i understand your thinking process."
"Yes.  A lot of people who only run in leagues, show up for special events.  They improve a lot practicing and running the league races and it doesn't show in their iR because they don't like doing officials and getting wrecked by knobs all the time...

Also..  You'll find certain people tank their iR in advance of special events to move down a few splits so they have a better chance of winning."
All the big tracks are very tough.
Compared to a lot of other tracks it’s not overly difficult imo. Also it’s super popular. I’d assume most people either test drive at spa or Daytona so many probably have more laps at those two tracks than any other
"44s in cool westher and 45s in hot would be expected.  Yes the fastest are 1-2secs faster.

Want to be faster still?

overlay 4-5 laps of telemetry and identify the corners/sectors youre stugggling to be your fastest with.  Go in a test session and focus on those corners.

Push the car harder and adjust your setup to handle it.  Easier said then done but this is why some of the more experienced are faster."
The 24 hours is more about avoiding repairs. Our best results were not due to extremely fast times but have very few repairs.
"2k is top 15th percentile. I just got there myself and don’t feel particularly quick but iRacing is so competitive to begin with, give yourself some credit! It felt like a big accomplishment when I got there."
"You will not find another event with faster drivers than the iracing Daytona 24. 5 corners, everyone runs it every year, you'll find people running at speeds 500+ iratings above where they usually sit"
I felt the same! I think many people have spent so much time practicing that the standard is very high here.
"Yes, I know lots of people who buy short term subscriptions for iRacing special events."
"More people than you think do these events, and dedicate a lot of time to it. You will have a lot of competition. It does make it challenging, which in turn makes your efforts more rewarding."
Dunno why its so popular because it is so BORING to drive on.
I didn't realize Spa brought out the fast folks
"I'm same iR and same lap times. Best is 44.5 or something but not consistently.

I don't practice much, and you need to put in the hours and also analyse to improve further."
I feel exactly the same as you! I’m 1.8-2k typically and despite practicing a ton for this years event I’m getting dusted by guys with 500 iR less than me. Lot of fast drivers out there!
I'm not good at Daytona either. I lose a lot of time at the chicane more often than not.
Number 2 for sure. I'm guilty of this along with a bunch of guys in our league. 1600 irating because I might run 3 or 4 endurance races a year because of how jaded normal officials have made me. But I'm normally on pace with 2 to 3k guys.
"\^ If someone reads this: Pushing the car harder most likely will not make you faster on Daytona. When I started to compare my lap times with the VRS telemetry the biggest factor of slow times is hard braking with the GT3. So if you are slower than others, you most likely disturb your cars balance by breaking to hard in important sections."
"This, last year we just took it safely finished the race 2nd with 1x between 3 of us. Would of finished 1st but had a pedal issue and had to roll down the pits"
"Well, the most prestigious sports car race in North America takes place there. That’s a pretty decent draw."
"I dont want to confuse anyone with over driving the car for their driving style.

There is always a faster driver and a faster setup.  One way to achieve one or both of these is to overdrive the car and adjust the setup to work with it ie. later braking, more corner speed, better acceleration... alot of the time you can also learn new driving techniques/experience doing so.

This is only 1 example of finding more speed.  There are many!"
"I do not care for the track popularity IRL, all I see is the boring layout of the road track. Why you'd want to focus the track for weeks is beyond me."
"Well sorry to say but your opinion has no reflection on the popularity.

It’s a 24-hour race, no amount of prep and practice can be enough. When you’re running a triple stint at 3am, you need to be able to drive it from memory and instinct when you’re not fully awake. It’s not the most technically demanding track, but it’s an unbelievable challenge nonetheless. It’s not a race for hot-lappers."
Hint… popularity. Luckily your opinion isn’t
"Why luckily? You own some shares of the track? Don't you think that some american tracks have more interesting layouts?

Without the indy races this track would be nothing."
Huh? Indy races… lol
Know how I know you're slow at Daytona?
"Big battles determined by bravery, aggressiveness, and race craft. That sounds like a pretty damn fun time to me."
"Somebody’s been getting killed a lot at Daytona this week huh? 

Daytona is great fun that would be why there are like ten splits every IMSA race."
I’m sorry but you’re wrong
Everyone commenting seriously here missed the whole point by a margin wider than you are faster than OP at Daytona.
"Except for your comment about the draft, every one of your corner “ratings” assumes you’re hot lapping by yourself. The difference between front and mid/rear engine cars at T1 is big enough to change up the whole infield battle. And try apexing late at the infield hairpin while racing…see what happens….

Rather that complaining a track is boring, how about finding ways to make it interesting for yourself?"
"As much as I don't like Roval's in general, Daytona is the exception for me.  It could be the history, or it could be the fact that it's an oasis in racings off-season, or it could be that whenever I get turn 1 or the bus stop correct (which isn't often) I FEEL LIKE A GOD :)"
Idk why you act like only fast cars are worth driving
yeahwellthatsjustyouropinionman.gif
"You can have your opinion, but I don’t really like takes like this because I like to find something interesting in every track! I’m always trying to improve my driving which means challenging myself to take different lines, different braking points, different steering inputs, etc. This can change tracks from boring to thrilling. I would say Daytona is more about the racing than the hotlapping, but digging into the details is the most challengingbut rewarding part of driving when come out better for it."
"skill issue, one of the greatest tracks there are for racing"
"It's a roval, it sucks by definition."
when you write a 5-paragraph essay lol
He actually wrote this during 1 lap in a GT3
there are ten splits because there's a 24h race.
"This sub is not the place for nuance, sarcasm, or anything that provokes thought.  The only provocable thing here is scorn."
"I kind of feel like you maybe missed the point that I was trying to exaggerate and present the most extreme opinion possible to trigger discussion.  There's nuance to everything but I wanted that to come out in the discussion, not lay it all out.

Like I said, I've done many races there in the past few weeks:  HPDs in PROTO/GT, GT4s both solo and with LMP3s, and another multiclass with pCup and GT4s, but in the pCup that time.  You obviously missed the part about side by side through the ""dogleg"" but hey, the main hobby of this sub is cherrypicking and criticizing OPs, while every once in a while doing iRacing."
new hampshire roval rules
"1. You get credited for a last, or nearly last, place finish, which results in losing iRating and being placed in future races with lower rated drivers.

2. You have incident points during a small number of corners in the race, which will result in a greater loss of safety rating, making it more difficult to level up your license.

Rookie and D class races all come with one fast repair. Use it and gain some more spots."
"At rookie level the most important thing is for you to be cutting laps. Never quit. quitting is for quitters, and only quitters quit."
"Unless you've already used your quick repair and the repair time will be longer than the race has left, finish.

Your license progression is tied to your Safety Rating. Your Safety Rating is based on incidents per corner. By quitting early, you increase your incidents per corner average, which causes your Safety Rating to drop.

Quitting early also causes you to finish lower than you might otherwise have done, which lowers your iRating. Your iRating is the matchmaking tool used to match you with equal skill drivers. By quitting early and taking worse finishes, you lower the skill of drivers you compete with. Which will put you with slower and more wreck-happy drivers."
Dont. Use your repair and go back out.  Leaving just kills your ir and sr.
"Leaving the session takes a tow and then the car stays exactly where it is. The car will also be serviced and repaired as long as you had it all checked to, so you can quit out and come back to a fixed car. You will not get a quitter penalty, but by the nature of your car not moving you'll get overtaken by everyone and lose rating that way. 

You also miss out on the opportunity to recover SR lost in a crash, as you're not out there turning corners. 

Most of the time it is just better to get the car fixed and get back out there, clock some laps, salvage what you can."
"Get back on the track and use the time to improve your safety rating. The more turns you do without any incidents (going off track, spinning out or wrecking) the more your safety rating will improve. If you leave early you will get docked points."
"Ahh cool, that’s what I was wondering and wanted to make sure that didn’t happen…Thanks for the reply!"
"You really don't want to quit races. I did it once and oof you lose a ton of safety rating and irating.

Get repaired -- be sure to turn off tire and gas so the quick repair is instant after the tow penalty -- and get back out there.

Every corner you drive effectively gives you safety rating, so you can gain rating despite a crash.

You also can very very reasonably still finish mid pack since at lower ratings plenty of other people crash."
"Historically, [at least in my experience] the ones who make those kind of comments are the ones you want to avoid."
It seems that there’s always AT LEAST one guy that has the whole “take it easy going into T1” spiel who then bins it within the first lap in every race lmao
I think its cuz the people who feel the need to say this are involved in the most incidents because they have not figured out that what they are doing is the common issue and not everyone else
These people are the same who spam 'pass left / right' and do weird shit in multiclass instead of just driving normally.
"Had something similar happen last week. Some kid (sounded like he was 12 years old) goes ""it's ok if you push me 9 car"". Then I hear 9 with a thick southern accent go ""yeeeehaww now you're speaking my language boy!"". No more than half a lap later my spotter spams ""wrecking in turn 4"", followed by the entire lobby erupting with insults at 9 car"
"There used to be a guy that text messaged “Rev your engines if you’re gay” whilst everyone was waiting for the race to start 

Highly offensive of course but listening to everyone’s engines go silent was pretty funny."
Every time I talk and drive… 😆
"I had a guy going on and on in chat begging everyone to keep it clean in T1. He got rear ended and was the only person who was out at T1, not even his fault, but I learned never to even say anything because karma works like that."
Indycar at Nords?  Great race!  I started p20 finished P4 without passing a single car.  Only 4 finishers!
"If you ain’t first, you’re last"
I also avoid anyone who wishes everyone luck. I prefer people having skill over luck.
I always make sure to tell people to dive bomb it into T1!!
That happens more often than you would think...
"These people always sound so pleasant at first, then inevitably spend the whole race bitching about any incident or even just someone racing them ""too hard."" Even the most 50/50 racing deal incident they'll sit on comms the whole race like ""nah you did that on purpose! enjoy your ban!"""
"I offset these guys by saying, “remember everyone, every single race ever has been won on turn one.” It used to be only when I overcooked my Quali laps and couldn’t get a clean one in. Then I realized nothing anyone ever says makes any difference, so I started saying it when I qualified in the front anyway. The divebimbers are gonna dive no matter what. 

Now that I’m in SF23, and apparently no one else ever even bothered to watch a tutorial for starts on YouTube, much less practice them before the actual race, it doesn’t even matter where I qualify. I can make up 10 positions while people trip over the stalls and stall themselves. If I’m near the front, I can usually run away for a couple laps before my true pace gets caught up by the drivers who are actually fast."
"The drivers who say it are usually the ones without the situational awareness and car control to spot risky situations and/or have a mindset where they won’t back out - which means they’re on the receiving end of a bunch of laps 1 incidents where others are technically at fault, but the rest of us would have survived. 

The same skill issues and lack of common sense are why they also cause more than their fair share of incidents."
"""Take it easy into Turn 1"" translates to ""I have no accident avoidance skills, and I also didn't qualify so I'm starting from the back, so if you crash I will inevitably run into you and blame you for ruining my race."""
"i here people say what you said all the time but never do they see it when i race with them OR do i ever see it. That is like a wives tale that never will go away IMO.

T1 murders come in all shapes/sizes"
They are reminding themselves.
"Reminds me of Hamilton at the restart in Baku 2021. There's only 2 laps left. He's P2 behind Sergio Perez.  **Goes on the radio to say ""This is a marathon, not a sprint""**. Lights go out, he is wheel to wheel with Perez into T1, has the inside line aaaaaaand....he locks up and goes straight into the runoff. There were only 2 laps, so no chance of recovery. He went from P2 to out of the points in the first turn."
"Theres one guy in F4 that says it every time, and then bashes people the whole race"
Self fulfilling prophecy haha
Ay I'm saying it to remind me as much as to remind you.
"Always think this is weird. When I'm driving the slower class, do they really think I have time to 1. Read chat and 2. Notice that the guy saying 'pass left' is the guy that is now behind me? I don't think those messages have any effect"
I like to say “rev your engines if you like weeeeeei-ners!” and then stand on the loud pedal.
Most skill based things need a little luck to win ;)
"Nailed it. 

It’s the ones who are constantly in crashes because “everyone else sucks”"
"Man I did a race yesterday and someone was getting impatient that I wouldn't pass the 2 slow cars in front of me. But I was so sure they were about to take either either out. The one car had been a problem since the rolling start.


Sure enough, guy behind me finally goes around and just as he catches up to them the 2 slow cars take each other out and one of them collects him.

Gained 3 places by just being patient."
"Just had this Happen today. I qualified 4th.  In turn 3 2nd and 3rd got into each other and I went low to avoid it. Guy from several positions back runs into me (turns me straight and sends me on my way) and clobbers the wall. He immediately gets on the mic furiously saying I ruined his race. I just said ""hey man, that's what you get for trying to pass into people crashing."" 😅"
Good old brake magic.
"It's crazy the amount of people that will go off on the race chat because their race got ruined.  As if anyone else cares about you and your opinion. Screams temper tantrum and narcissism.  Shut up, save the replay, leave the lobby, and protest what happened in an hour.  No one else needs to hear your sob story.  Or at least wait until the race is over!"
"A real man makes his own luck. 

--Billy Zane, Titanic"
Shake and bake!
"Aproximating the speed to 260km/h since it is daytona, every 0.001 time differnece means just 7.2cm, that is insanely close. GG"
"Hell I dont think I could be mad for very long if I ended up in that situation. Thats INSANELY close, and helluva job putting in P2 from P12!"
I got p2 right at the line!

Never heard anyone refer to a race cars paint scheme as a kit before
Really though it’s always been livery or paint scheme in the Motorsport context. Only time I see kit used is when a Brit is talking about their soccer uniform

That's a slam dunk protest. It will be successful.
buddy is asking for a vacation
Looked like they got DQ’d at the end of the vid too lol
That guy probably doesn’t like his life
"Yes, report that please"
why did you stay behind him?
"F4 is great fun, especially at Spa. But it really brings out the little man syndrome in some of these dudes, I swear."
I was in shock by this dude’s behavior. Took me a couple laps to snap out of it but never seen such a blatantly disrespectful move as a response to a minor mistake.
How long does someone get banned for shit like this?
He was swerving on the whole straight. Had no clue where the guy would end up by the time I needed to brake. Thought it would be better to just hold the racing line. Honestly thought he was just being a dick in the moment by swerving but wasn’t expecting him to turn into me tbh
"Yeah, this is one of the protests where he’ll magically not be participating in any races for a while after."
Realistically probably a week on a first time ban. It’s not common to see bans longer than a week unless there’s some history behind that behavior.
It’ll be a warning & it also makes no difference to your well being what the length of the ban is. Move on
If it's his first time he'll probably get a warning. If he's been protested for it before the punishment will likely be proportional to how many times he's been reported for it.
"Despite that you'll see some people go on about vacations for extremely minor incidents, iRacing is very slow to issue bans and suspensions. Even the most egregious behavior will usually take multiple incidents to permanently remove them from the service."
Don’t jump down my throat dude. This is literally the first time I’ve ever protested something in iracing since starting a few months ago. Was simply asking a question out of curiosity
Found the shitty driver everyone
Lol. Just tell us how long they banned you for this.
"Don't mind that grumpy old man. As far as I know, it might be a warning if it's the first time and a 7 day ban if it's not the first time. If he's done this multiple times, he might get an indefinite ban."

"This is the case anywhere on iracing, nothing special about the location. If you have a meatball flag and the race ends before you get a penalty, you don’t get the penalty."
Why is this nsfw?

Fair and I understand. I learned about it at Bathurst

"As someone else has already told you, it is because the host didn't set up car classes when making the session.

But fun fact: since you are all technically in one class, as long as you're in a slower class, you can just basically ignore any slowdowns you get, because the system judges whether you're giving back time based off of your class leaders, which will be the GTPs."
Thanks
"Ohh, sneaky..."
"So after the race you can save the replay with the tools button. You can even cut a scene out. Maybe you should cut your highlights from a TV camera angle or something for a highlight replay. Enjoy your iRacing journey!
And get yourself “Crew chief”! It’s a free mod and is a massiv upgrade for your gaming experience in my opinion."
Thank you! I downloaded Crew Chief and Racelabs last night so looking forward to getting them set up
You’re in for a massive awakening as soon as you leave rookies and even more if you continue through the licences
"The better your race finishes, the stiffer the competition becomes. Thats what iRating is for. If these wins feel “too easy”, it’s because your iR doesn’t match your skill level yet. Regardless, grats on the Ws! 


You start at like 1350 iR I believe, and you should be able to see that once you’re out of Rookies. 2-2.2k is roughly where a wall exists for most folks. After that, you’re more or less competing to get into top splits, then top split Ws. Good luck, and welcome in!"
"One of the biggest mistakes you can do is think you are good. Just don't do this, stay humble, accept that you suck and all should be fine. This way you keep improving.

If you are winning, just imagine all the drivers being idiots for losing to you. Instead of thinking you're good, think the other are bad instead. Keeps you humble. And sane"
"As others have said, yes, you are in for a wake up call. Once you get out of rookies and start progressing through the licensing tree you’ll find that there are a lot of people a lot better than you. Often times I’ll feel like I am pushing a car to its absolute limit and putting in perfect laps and there are people going 1+ seconds faster than me. It’s a tough reality but we all face it."
"You drifters are usually mad quick when you decide to stop messing around!

In all seriousness now, if you have 11 podiums in 11 races I'll bet your iRating must be around 1800, if not higher -  if you are D class you can check it out for yourself. You might get into a top split soon, and there you might find some of the truly fast guys... that might be your wake up call. Anyways, 11 podiums in 11 races is a killer start to your iRacing career!"
"Almost everyone gets a wakeup call, some just get it earlier than others. Sounds like you're doing good...iRating will do it's job and the better you do, the better your opponents get. 

Well done, keep it up."
"Some guy recently posted he just got a win after not getting one for seven years. The better you get the less often you win, unless you dedicate yourself to a single series/car. My super fast friends say they don’t remember the last time they won and don’t care as it’s more about the individual battles you have with people and closer racing."
"Don’t forget to have fun! And when you get mad and frustrated. Don’t lash out and be toxic on chat. It’s not worth it. At the end of the day its just a game. Just like any online multiplayer games you will eventually run into toxic people. I choose to kill them with kindness. 

When incidents happen, regardless if it is your fault or not. Review the replay and ask yourself what could I have done differently in that situation. Apologize via voice or text chat and move on. You will have a better experience. 

Good Luck and welcome!"
yeah you will hit a wall eventually.. most drivers in rookie license class are incredibly slow.. just finishing a race will net you a lot of points simply because other drivers can't even make it to the finish line... Eventually people get much faster and you actually have to fight for position at every turn instead of getting them for free.
once your irating gain catches up to your skill you will be placed in races with the best drivers in the world who chose to play at that specific point in time 
"I won my first Rookie race, took pole in 3 of 4 Rookie races.  Never won again until 375 days later, and that was only because of a favorable split where I was in the #1 door in the Second Split (rather than the typical getting crushed in Top Split) in the LMP2.

So, yes, you're most likely in for a nice dose of reality after a few D class races when you're initial iRating likely spikes up a bit....unless you're just a natural phenom."
"The better you get the harder it is. Most people win a few races in rookie then literally never win again. I won my first ever race on the service, won an Arca race then didn’t win again for almost 2 years. Wins top split are hard to come by. 

I racked up like 96 wins in ovals over a 5 year period but now I don’t race much anymore so I’ll probably never win again."
Ahaa I knew it. It will be welcomed with warm arms tho. I’m excited to see how far up I can get with time
Ahh nice il look forward to hitting that 2k then. What are splits?
I don’t think I’m good at all I’m happy for some wins  and then more confused and concerned/ now excited about how the racing will progress.
">just imagine all the drivers being idiots for losing to you

If I ever win a race, this is *exactly* how I'll feel."
"Quick hands

Experienced car control

Comfortable with oversteer

Can drive in close proximity to others

Know how to shift the weight balance

Most of the basic ingredients to becoming a successful racer be developed through drifting!

The difficult part comes with mastering braking, refining your racing line, and managing tire wear."
"yeah, it's nice to win, but my most memorable races have been for the nothing positions, an almost race long battle for 12th at Road America being the pick, both of us pushing as hard as we could, but being respectful, not trying to win corners we'd already lost."
"6.5. RACE SPLITS

6.5.1. iRacing.com strives to have similarly skilled drivers racing together in each event. The more drivers that register for a
given race time, typically the closer the skills of each driver will be matched for that race. Should more drivers register for
a race session than the track and/or series allows, the race will be instantiated and the registered drivers are split into
separate fields that race at the same time.

6.5.2. Drivers are placed in a particular race split based primarily on their iRating at the time of the start of the race.

6.5.3. Other factors may be taken into account for determining race splits beyond iRating at the sole discretion of iRacing.com
in order to improve the online competition environment.

[The Sporting Code](https://www.iracing.com/iracing-official-sporting-code/) will answer a lot of questions."
"Every race sessions is split into ""splits"" because you can't have 100 people on the same track.

Splits are done by iRating, the highest go into the top split, the lowest go into the lowest. You can see the splits on top of the results page of that race.

Seeing how you are going, you will hit top split in mazda's pretty soon. This is where you can see how you compare to the quicker guys."
"Splits are the concurrent race servers for a series for a particular time slot. If 72 folks register for a hypothetical race at 5 PM, they won’t all be in the same server—they will be *split* across multiple servers. If there’s 12 cars per grid, that’s 6 splits. The list of registered drivers is sorted by iR, then servers are created for the time slot with top split being created first (helpful to know that the lowest server # is the top split if you want to ghost race for practice), followed by all remaining splits."
"When registration for a race ends, iRacing divides everyone up by iRating. This is so each race has the correct number of racers and everyone in the race should, in theory, be of similar skill level. 


Top split is just the name for the first group made of the top X registered players for a given race."
"Once you race enough and get into (and stay) in your proper skill level you probably won't be fighting for wins nearly as much. 

It's not uncommon to see people here talking about how they just got a win after a 3-4 year dry streak."
"I think you are finishing races, but I'm wondering why, after so many races, you haven't been promoted yet."
Oooo il try to check this out tonight. I’m getting proper pumped for this game now hearing about how it all does the SBMM
Wow! Just wow that is some in depth micro managing of skill based I’ve heard about. There’s going to be some tight racing in the future then
"This is what makes iracing awesome. Some series have many participants. Sometimes a 2 tenths quicker in quali can be 10 places up the grid

In my first 18 races I had 6 wins. Now I have 260 races and 14 wins in total. With sometimes 30 cars on track winning gets a lot harder. If you are top split it will be nearly impossible in some series"
"My absolute favorite is the Petit Le Mans, my second favorite is easily sebring"
"25 min Sim Lab series.

"the Nürb always deliver incredible spectacle, but Le Mans has a special place in my heart"
"Most popular: C class Trucks Fixed and ARCA.

Best: longer races like B Open, the 1987 cars, Gen 4, CARS Tour Open."
"The normal NASCAR progression (and by far most popular route) is ARCA, NASCAR C (Trucks), NASCAR B (Xfinity), NASCAR A (Cup), but you can do other stuff too like Gen4 Cup car or '87 Cup.

If you really like short track ovals, you might like late model stocks and super late models, or sk modifieds and whelen modifieds."
"I’ll advocate for INDYCAR Oval as a fun (currently) C class series. Population can be a bit slim outside of the evening in the US, but I’ve had much better luck with clean racing and cooler tempers compared to the time I’ve spent in the various nascar series, aided by the fact that most people running it are B and A license"
"At least for D class the ARCA car is probably the best bet, solely because you also get the Gen 4 too (same car, higher HP) and that will get you in to C class. And it's a fun car to drive both ways too, and probably more popular than the late model for D class anyways."
Thanks for all the replies! I'll start with ARCA then probably trucks
Love the 1987
"I'll sing the praises of LMSC at every opportunity I get.

It's one of the best oval cars in the service. It's even fun on road courses."
So I’m gonna start running D Series ovals and gonna go down the ARCA path.  Next weeks it’s at Concord and idk how tf you race that in ARCA.  Just doing solo testing on it feels like it’s gonna be a wreckfest
Thanks for the info. I follow Nascar casually and will be following SVG's progress this year. Do the iRacing schedules and irl schedules line up?
"I'll also say that I think Indycar Oval is a very good place to learn how a car that relies on downforce behaves in dirty air. If you know how your car will react as you go through someone's aero wash at Texas, you'll be better prepared for when it happens at Watkins Glen or Road America.

While the Oval series is C Class right now, apparently next season they're making it *all*-oval, and moving it to B class. Then the Road series will have 5 ovals like it does this season.

The USF2000 and Indy Pro 2000 also run the same schedule as each other, with three ovals this season."
"I love Indycar irl but I'm hesitant to do it in iRacing because I live in Australia which means 250+ ping to US servers, so I find net code is a problem with anything faster than GT3"
"When the irl season starts, NASCAR C, B, and A will all start following the irl schedule. Off-weeks irl will just have something else filled in on iracing"
"Congratulations brother, keep it up!"

I’m interested too. Currently 1800iR been bouncing between 1800-2300 the past month.
Probably a better idea to include your IR as opposed to SR.
iRating of 1600. Just wanting to be a part of a cool event. Goal is completion and a good time.

Okay sounds good. Sending you a dm
What's your CPU.
Take this comment as if it were coming from someone who has only vaguely recalled something about the number of cars you have in the rear view mirror as being a real fps killer.
Reruns the graphics config. It’s located somewhere near your exe file.
"I use Surround on my triples with a 4070, i7 13700KF and 32 gb RAM. I usually run between 100 FPS to 125 FPS consistently with most settings maxed out. What are your computer specs? FPS?"
Why does anyone use Nvidia surround with iracing?
Please post some screenshots of your iracing graphics settings in game and we can give some advice.
"Turn Shadow Maps and Self Shadowing off those are fps killers. Why the card makes less Fps on the same settings i don’t know. My guess is the settings never where the same to begin with and SOME automatically changed, but without a screenshot before and after changing the gpu there is no way to be sure because there are soooo many different options. Nvidias auto overclock feature might be a reason too if the previous gpu was overclocked that might explain why it performed slightly better. But to be honest iRacing is more of a Cpu Game anyways so from my experience there is more Fps to gain by upgrading that. Lastly never compare Ai races to normal races because those are a lot more Cpu intense than normal races and don’t compare numbers while you are outside the car because graphic settings differ from the replay function and the settings screen to being actually in the car."
I7 13700 and 4090 here. I have no issues maintaining between 120 and 160 FPS on Max settings.
"I9 129000k

But I solved the problem, it was just bad optimisation of Daytona, on newer tracks I have no problem even when doing a screen record"
"I use Surround & have zero issues. If you're going to complain about Surround, why not give your reason why you don't like it. I'm not a fan boy of Surround or Windows, just curious. I've used the ini edit when I first installed my triples, but HDR in Surround is the main reason I switched, plus my computer is dedicated to sim racing."
I will as soon as I can!
also this video (you should watch both parts) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM7aoHyldeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM7aoHyldeo)
Self shadowing and shadow maps shouldn't be so bad as of this season as it's now more of a GPU than CPU load. 
Could you share your graphic settings if it’s possible?
oh thanks for the tip. i will try it out again! 🫶🏽

Ram and GPU-Memory use shouldn’t be at max tho
Those are gone after a recent update. This was an old screenshot.

"I have heard other people say don’t use NVIDIA Surround, use the iracing settings for triple monitors."
"Run it at 1080p, not 1440. Frame rate > pixel count in racing games. 

I can run 6400 x 1080 on a 3070 ti at over 180 fps (one ultra wide 34"" with two 27"" monitors). You should easily be able to drive triples with a 40 series card and a good CPU at 1080p. The extra pixels will not be worth it if you're missing braking points because of frame rate fluctuation."
"So I run an RTX 3080 and i7 8700k. 2560x1440p triple Dell monitors. I turned down pit objects, turns off crowds, and run the lowest quality shader and saw improvement. I still dip below 60-50fps at times with a lot of detail and cars, but after that I’m running 80-100fps on triples. 

For whatever reason I’ve seen the few triple setup tutorials Enable SPS? idk if that would be significant but maybe give that a shot on top of what I adjusted. 

I feel like IRacing messed up optimization with the last few updates cause before this season I had no issues running what I did before when I ran a single 34in monitor and when I upgraded to triples."
"Interesting.  I am using surround, does the Iracing way apply some sort of bezel correction?  My monitors are about 8 years old so they have about 1/2"" bezel."
"i dont use surround, I use Iracing to set it up and I modified the renderer.ini files to make it work. 

I have been wondering if using surround would help? I would need to stop using my 4th monitor for overlays correct? Since racelabs requires iracing be ran in windowed mode?"
"I tried 1080p and can’t get over the drop in image quality. I feel like I should be able to run this at 1440. If I need a better cpu, I have no problem upgrading. I just don’t know enough and am afraid I have 1 setting checked wrong and that’s probably my issue"
"Yes when you click monitor in graphics settings you can set bezel size.

I recommend making a backup your graphics INI once you are happy with it in case it changes it on you."
"I use Surround on my triples with a 4070, i7 13700KF & 32 gb RAM with most iRacing settings maxed out and I have no issues running 100 FPS to 125 FPS "
"My bad, I misinterpreted the resolution as meaning it was running in surround.

I would suggest bringing your refresh rate down a notch. Not sure what options you get but 100hz might get you closer to a locked 100fps?"
"Hey! Just something I tweaked that worked for me so far. I took my Anisotropic and MSAA filters to x4 and put LOD FPS to 90, then set both LOD to “- Only” while keeping most visual settings like Cars, Objects, Event at high. Only things I really have Medium/Low there are sky, grandstands, and crowd"
"i should try surround tonight, can you run any sort of overlays with surround though?

what about a 4th monitor?"
I don't currently have overlays or 4th monitor but I've read where both work fine with Surround. 
"I saw a video out there where a guy shows the difference in FOV between standard, ultrawide, and super ultrawide vs. 3 monitors.  The wider the monitor, the more FOV but not even close to 3 monitors.  Take a look at that to see if its worth it.  I have a 34"" ultrawide and after seeing that I don't think it would be worth going to the 49"""
"34"" ultrawide is an aspect ratio of 21:9 or roughly 1.3, 27"" screens. 

49"" super ultrawide is 32:9 or 2 full 27"" screens. 

Yes, it will improve your FOV at the same distance. 

Yes, iRacing can be configured properly for it."
"I did the exact upgrade you did as i don't have space for triples, it's the best upgrade you can do but even though it improves the FOV it's still not quite enough to see out the leftside window in some cars (provided you have a mathmatically correct FOV).

Basically yes its better but it's not quite as much of an upgrade as i had hoped in terms of FOV."
"Neither. Get triples. Cheaper and much better. 

I tried 21:9 ultrawide. It really doesn't give you any more usable FOV.  32:9 gives you a little more usable FOV, but they're so much more expensive than just getting triples that they make no sense.  Even Matt Malone's monster 57"" super ultrawide still isn't big enough--he still has to use the look left/right buttons when racing close. 

Literally nothing beats seeing a car out of the corner of your eye as you're going wheel to wheel. I don't even have look left/right mapped to buttons anymore because all it will show me is more of my halo seat."
Yes.  More width pixels at the same distance will open your view up
"I'm assuming this is the Samsung G9 or similar, that is also curved? There are videos for setting up the FOV on that 49, since the curve complicates the calculations a little bit.  I have a 34 inch curved ultrawide, and I would 100% go for the 49 if it was viable in my budget/space."
"Yes, it will give you significantly more real estate to expand your fov. If you plan it out correctly, you can gain even more fov by figuring out how to sit as close as possible to your monitor as well. I spent some time planning my setup and run the 49” monitor about 14.5 inches from my face and I am able to run 118 fov which looks fantastic."
"I went from 34"" UW to 49"" SUW. I do regret it.

Just get triples. The increase in FOV isn't worth the expense."
Same boat sir!
"I went from a 34"" to a 49"" and don't regret it for a second."
"Agreed. I bought a 43"" monitor thinking that it would be better than a 32"" monitor in terms of FOV and good enough.  

A year later I had three 43"" monitors and an FOV of around 200 degrees.  Triple screens covering all you can see is awesome, but yeah this hobby is a continual path of what's the next thing I need🙃."
"Good deal, you think it's worth the 3x price then?"
If you can afford it yeah. I don't have the space for triples but the extreme curve of the G9 is pretty awesome and I can see the entire windshield and at least the driver sidemirror in every car.
"I would suggest CPU, but you should consider analyzing some telemetry from a race to see whether you're maxing out CPU or GPU usage."
"I don’t think the quest 3 is worth it over the quest 2 when it comes to using linked to your PC. 

But yeah, I’d definitely upgrade the CPU. I’d imagine the 3060ti would do okay, I used a 3070 with it just fine. Took a little tinkering"
Do you need to? My 3060 runs thus perfectly well in vr
"The 3600 is starting to show its age. I run VR on a fairly similar setup (i7-8700k, 3070, 32GB) and I’m starting to look into upgrading my cpu. 

I don’t think your system would be cause for concern before getting a Quest 3. I have some slight stuttering at times, but nothing “literally unplayable” even. So, you seem “VR Ready” already imo."
"Im rocking a 1060ti and my VR still works just fine.  


It really just depends on VRAM, if you have just an 8gb card then I'd upgrade GPU, if its more than that I'd go the CPU upgrade route."
"You'd want 90fps for racing. 

It depends on what class you race in (number of cars), if it's not a field of 60 cars, I'd start with GPU. If you go multiclass, it gets very cpu hungry.

But preferably both, since both are on the lower end for VR."
"Get a 5800x3d. They're cheap and will give a huge boost. Even more if your motherboard allows you to undervolt (most do on latest bios). 

Got mine running at 4.2 and didn't see a single frame drop at Daytona on a 3060 Ti. "
"I disagree, I upgraded and the pancake lens make a huge difference"
"completely different level.

pancake lenses on the qpro were night and day better than the hp g2 and quest 2.

quest 3 is literally the best pcvr hmd for sim racing.

huge fov, edge to edge clarity.

your delusional if you cant see the benefit, or havent tried..."
"Have you tried or owned them both? Even outside iRacing just on the virtual desktop or anything, the Q3 is just on a totally different level. It took me almost a month to sell my Q2 because I totally forgot about that I had it. The jump from my Cv1 to Q2 was really good, the jump from Q2 to Q3 is a different ballgame altogether."
"depends on res/hmd.

dont forget native res of the quest 2 is well over 2500x2500.

3060 can run vr no problem, but not properly or at native res."
"Hey thanks for the reply. Quick question - I’ve got a quest 2 currently and mostly run ovals, but the track and cars are horribly blurry just 100-200 feet ahead. Do you notice any improvement on Quest 3?"
"It’s a bit of an upgrade for sure, just didn’t think it was worth it.

As a stand-alone device, it’s quite the upgrade.

But hey, I’m glad you like it. Just my personal opinion/experience, I may be alone on this."
"Woah man relax 😅

The differences to me were minuscule and not worth the price difference imo."
totally agree with the quality difference. I don't even have to keep looking for the sweetspot with the Q3. It's almost clear wherever I look. Unlike with my old Q2 and CV1. Good thing is I was able to sell the Q2 in ebay for a decent price.
"I don't have a Quest 3. I went for a Reverb G2 after my Quest 2 becuase I was sick of the latency, reliability and user experience of Oculus Link.  

Unfortunately Microsoft has deprecated WMR so my Reverb will stop working in a few years so I can't recommend it as a headset to buy.   

If things are blurry, there's 101 guides out there for optimizing the Oculus settings in Oculus Debug Tool but there was a noticable ""wow"" when I moved to the Reverb G2 and it seems like most people experience a similar improvement with Quest 3, except with a very wide ""sweet spot"" where the image is crisp/in focus.

Unfortunately, I just won't buy another Oculus headset unless they move to supporting PCVR natively via DisplayPort, but that seems very unlikely given (my opinion) the PCVR support only still exists so developers building Quest games/apps don't need to deploy to device all the time."
"maybe your gpu isnt up to the task?

quest 3 native res requires at least a 3080ti for iracing and most pcvr.

4090 for best results."
"Fair enough, dunno why people are getting so angry at you having an opinion 😂"
I have a 4090
"“WHAT DO YOU MEAN BRO YOU MUST BE DELUSIONAL”

"To get into that flow state where you're finally driving the car after learning the track and you're no longer afraid of corners, you're attacking corners... that's a beautiful thing. It's like learning to play a song on an instrument. The better you get, the smaller and more manageable the errors become. The more you can play around within the track/composition. There's no other gaming/sports experience like this that I've found."
"We dont just say this stuff to mess with you noobs lol.  We say it to actually help you become comfortable on track and use track knowledge and information aka markers,  kurbs,  that one weirdly shaped tree i use as my brake point😂🤣😅.

I'm glad you have listened.  I am also glad you are seeing improvement.  Just keep at it.   Use all the track when it makes sense to.   And keep it just under the limit.   You got this!."
[deleted]
IMO I wish iRacing would remove the line entirely for all series above rookie level.
"Perfect, the driving line is a big hinderance imo. And should not be used. Use visual cues for braking references. You get to the point of just using engine sound to know when to brake at what corner."
"I prefer it with the line off and agree with op. 

But recently I have found if i don’t have a lot of time for iRacing, I will keep the line on. It helps me when I still don’t know the track."
"I give myself a 10 min practice session with the line on when learning a new track and after 10 mins, i'll turn it off. Helps as a jumping off point for learning a new track, i'll use it mostly for braking limits and figuring out where to look for the braking zone."
I never turn it on in any racing game on any track.
"Good job, :)

I've never used the racing line in iRacing but I did use it when starting off playing racing games in general with the F1 games.  In that game, whenever I turned the line off I did absolutely horribly.  Though eventually I realized that was because I had yet to actually learn any of the tracks because of the line preventing the need to do so.  So then I turned it off and had to learn how to learn a track, useful skill to have figured out."
I’ve never turned it on in iracing. It’s been fun figuring out the lines and braking points.
"I 100% use it to get up to speed on a track, and to learn the line. But as you said, it turns into a hindrance later on, as you get faster, as your braking points are different. 

So if you continue to use the line, it's ""brake X amount of time after it turns red"". And if you're racing closely, you've got a car ahead and you can't see it!

It's better to instead, once you learn the line, to use the actual visual references of the track (brake markers, trees, walls, little yellow things in the fence at Daytona, etc) to brake, especially in VR."
I agree with OP “Fo for it!”
"I leave it on, but I don’t follow it. Since I’m in D class , most these others guys do and you can tell who follows it. Makes it easy to pass and anticipate where they are going to be to avoid getting hit(minus mistakes)"
Tbh the racing line is always on. I’m looking at the rubber on the track in practice sessions. However I typically practice more than I race
"Do people really rely on the racing line like that? Most tracks take 1:30-2:00 minutes to get around, easy enough to remember after a few laps. Also, braking markers should be like, a racing 101 thing. The tracks are literally lined with them. 

I feel like any reliance on the racing line is just going to hinder you from actually learning the track. Too busy looking at the line and not the track itself. It's okay to crash, that's what practice is for. 

Do a few laps, learn the layout, and start pushing. You'll get it eventually."
No racing line from the start makes u learn the track so much quicker (also practice sessions following others help fast track learning that much more
I’m in vr and use the racing line but don’t follow it for breaking points or for its race line.  It’s sometimes difficult for me to see if a turn is coming up so that’s sort of why I keep it turned on.
"I used the racing line when I used to race on console (Forza, F1 games) with a controller. Once I got iRacing, I didn't know it had one, so I just did without. I'm glad I have, because in iRacing, the line is more of a hindrance and a crutch than helpful. Can't overtake on the outside or inside line if you're just following the racing line."
The racing line sucks. I've tried to use it to learn new tracks in road but it often makes me way slower and I don't LEARN the track. I just learn what the racing line says. Don't learn how to attack corners properly and stuff. I usually just watch others turn laps on it and learn that way. I never get a feel for the track using the racing line.
The best advice I got when first starting iRacing is to not use the line. I can't see any benefit and it certainly won't give an edge over somebody in a race that actually just learned the track.
"I keep it on when I’m learning a track and try to get faster by moving off the racing line. After I get the memory down I turn it off. 

However I absolutely cannot turn the racing line off for Daytona roval and I don’t know why"
Yep. The line is awful. I wish it wasn't in the sim at all
"Yeah not only will you be quicker, you'll pick up new tracks quicker."
"When I finally stopped using it it was a lightbulb moment. Being able to understand a track and not just memorize braking points was huge. 

I still use it occasionally in practice but yeah, it hurts more than it helps."
Instead of the line you use the braking markers and track landmarks The rubbered in area of the track will give you a greneral idea of the racing line. ;-)
I have forced myself to turn it off everywhere except Nordschelife because I get lost so easily.
https://youtu.be/535Zy_rf4NU?si=I_qM6IbTmeQs0kTe
I use the line if I'm learning a new track. After about 10-20 laps it just gets in the way. Run the track according to your car and how you tune it.
I need to do this sigh
"I’ve recently built a simrig, have been using racing line on sim-lite games like Forza and GT and a controller. I want to ditch the line, I only use the braking zone indicator in GT, braking line in FM, because I feel it’s been a crutch for me. 

I played about 30 minutes each of AC, iRacing, FM, and GT and realize wheel steering is a whole new learning curve, so will probably keep the line/zones until I get up to speed with simrig driving. Then I’ll quit using them."
"I think the racing line shouldnt be available, personally i load a track and send it until i stop crashing"
I almost wish that iracing would only allow the racing line to be on if you’re doing a private test session on a track. No public lobbies.
"thing is, i am playing on a single 1080p monitor, and i feel like i have no depth without the lines.. i feel bad for playing with them though."
"That’s what I always tell people. If you’ve been using the line for a long time, you’ll naturally be using the right points."
"I keep it on but I don’t really use it and I’m color blind anyways most time I forget it’s there and never really been that helpful never really used it or dependent on it 

so I always used reference points ie track markers or trees or the feeling of the track even shadows and note the last min deep braking points due to my color blindness 

I say keep it lol so I know what line your taking and I can pass you easier 

But I understand why it’s there especially for new people coming in 

I never understood the down talk on peoples preference’s  

But at the end of the day for people that use it or don’t just don’t crash into me and give me a 4x times 3 times for me trying to pass you"
"Just did the same last week and I share the same experience. 

I was using the racing line colors for braking markers and sticked closely to it for acceleration too. Disabling it made me slower initially but then I quickly picked up space and now I'm getting faster than before. It's like now I feel the car more and that allows me to experiment with different racing lines. 

I turn it on to practice s new track. But it's turned of before end of practice. 

Should have done it looping time ago"
"Playing an instrument and racing are really the same thing.

I played violin for 8 years and it's the only thing close I can describe racing to be like. Braking-entry-apex-exit-accelerate straight repeat.

Each part is a note you try to play perfectly."
I really enjoyed this comparison. I never played an instrument but I know exactly what you mean about how the better you get the smaller the errors become and how you can increasingly play around on a track. Makes all the sense in the world that it would be the same playing a song.
"As a guitarist, i feel this so much."
"I did a B class NASCAR classics race the other day and was counting the 3M logos on the wall at michigan as my braking points, looking for things on the fence or caution lights to use as well."
I guarantee you that following some of the most common advice given on this subreddit (never use the line) is not why you suck.
Eh I feel the line hinders your ability when racing maybe it's okay for solo lapping but when your side by side with someone going into a turn sometimes you need to brake later and harder to use some of the rear lock to pivot the car the right way its instinctively hard to do that when the line tells you to brake earlier
Tbh you probably suck because you've convinced yourself that you're sucky. Confidence issue.
Only enable it in practice sessions would be the best option
D class would be even more chaotic.
"The driving line is a series of 1 meter triangles that create perfectly replicable braking points lol.

If your advice is ""use visual queues"" the driving line is broken as fuck and basically cheating.

Just don't use it as a driving line, use it as a series of 1 meter brake markers."
jesus 2.0
"When you're literally flying at that speed if it weren't for down force ... I think it's legit to use racing line starting out in F1 or take more laps slower. The line I feel gives you a reference point. Then replay top seeded racers after a good lap in a race. Then try to replicate by doing ghost on a race in the 2nd lap with top seed and see if you can keep up and taking all the corners and braking as that person does. Then achieve some similar splits, then go race."
Free yourself off the line. You'll still be able to pass and avoid people. You got this.
"Yeah, VR quality seems pretty rough for racing. Subtle variations in the track surface, especially color gets washed out and the horizon becomes fuzzy and unclear way sooner than with a monitor."
I've played drums since elementary school. The comparisons in regards to repetition and how one practices are nearly endless!
Same!
I was never really a stickler for not using the racing line despite what people said. I still use it for about 10 laps on every new track I run just for visual memorization. Then one day I watched Lando give shroud advice on his first time playing iracing and he said he always uses the line on tracks he doesn’t know. So I use that as my justification lol
"I actually turned it ON recently at Spa in F4. Kept having these guys take super weird lines or act like they’ve got no choice but to turn in when there’s plenty of room. 

I turned the line on so I could see where everyone else was gonna go! People who use the racing line tend to become fixated on it. So weirdly, it was a fascinating tool to use against them 😂"
"No it wouldn't, then you wouldn't have 75% of people following a line instead of racing "
It would be safer w/ the line off.
"Driving line isn’t even the fastest way around the track, how’s that cheating"
The problem with the driving line is that you dont learn the track. You. You won't get better. You do not developrace craft. You're just following a line.
"I think it ends up being a thing where some people struggle to avoid driving to follow the line vs driving the course and simply using the line as an extra set of markers.

I left it on by accident this week and haven't bothered to turn it off."
Finally someone with a brain.
"Everybody is dumb…idk who just follows the line like a monkey. I keep it on 24/7 and stay above 2k iRating.

I use it for visual brake markers and depth perception on my single monitor. The 1 meter triangles tell me *exactly* how far away that apex is, and also sets references for brake markers.

“Brake at the 5th red triangle” for example. It’s literally a ruler on the ground, if you *don’t* use it to your advantage you’re dumb."
don’t know why this is downvoted i use it excactly for that and it works well
The monitor has its downfall also.  It’s trying to put something we see in RL that takes up all of our vision/world into a 32in monitor or whatever size you have.  Or maybe I’m getting old and my eyesight 🤷‍♂️
"They're saying they don't follow it as their line or take it's suggestion for where to brake, turn, etc. they use it as an extra marker. Because the racing line is segmented, you can use the segments themselves as markers like you would any other marker. I'd still say I'd just roll without it but it's a ""cheat"" because it can theoretically lead to more granular braking markers."
"I've abused the shit out of the racing line in exact manner the poster above described and I'm 7k rn. I guess I'd be pro level if I didn't use it (Spoiler: I wouldn't)

As a braking marker it is unbeatable. When practicing a new track for events where you can't use it (aka every high level event), it is still a great tool. If there's a corner without a good marker, if you've first hit the perfect braking marker 30 times with the help of the line, you can hit it pretty well without it as well, because at that point you've ingrained the rhythm of the track.

Of course you don't need it and I don't think any of the actual pros use it in the way I've done. But I find it silly to categorically say it ""holds people back"" or smth."
"You don't need to follow the line :p By following your argument you would be faster if there were no distance markers (150m, 100m, 50m) before a corner. See any problem here?"
"Yeah I can’t see most of the posted brake markers in VR until I’m way too close them. And forget using about tiny patches of dirt, or abnormal curbing or road rubber as a marker. The racing line braking marks are the only thing I can reliably see 100% of the time, so I keep it on for any track I’ve done less than 100 laps on. I know the real solution is to get a new PC and headset that can run at a higher resolution, but honestly if I can click a button and save $2k+, imma just hit the button."
">and I'm 7k rn.

Why are you lying?"
I never thought of it that way. 
Braking markers and the virtual line aren’t even comparable.
Sure they are. The same thing with different amount of visual clutter.
"They are not at all the same thing. One is an inaccurate imaginary line and the other is a board located in a fixed place off the side of the track. The virtual line is a crutch used by low skilled drivers. Plus, if you actually took the time to learn the track, you would know that braking markers are not always the choosing braking point. Some tracks don’t have markers in place and even when they do, not every car is braking at the same point. The virtual line is the same no matter what car you’re in and takes your focus away from driving and instead glues your eyes to the pavement right in front of your car."
"You can use virtual drive as a fixed places on track to break. For that purpose it's even better as it's easier to see and more accurate as it has markers more dense than basic 50 meters.

Sure it's more visual clutter on screen but it doesn't mean you can't use it for same purpose as markers on track :D

The fact that new players use it as a crutch doesn't mean that skilled players can't use it wisely. 

For example if you overshoot at 50m and undershoot at 100m the breaking point is somewhere in between; with racing line you can tone it down even more accurately as you got markers for every 5meters. Having turn in point at ""near apex"" isn't as accurate ""at 5th triangle 2meters left of racing line"" .

Your point is just invalid.

The reason why I don't use the racing line isn't that it's a crutch but that it's visual clutter that's hard to tune off. Thus driving without it makes it easier and more enjoyable for me. If I wanted to get the best possible hotlap then virtual line would be perfect tool for that as I could hone in the breaking,acceleration and turning points with pinpoint accuracy."
i don’t know how you can comment on the driving line so confidently when you don’t even know that it is indeed different depending on the car you are in 😂
You can perform whatever mental gymnastics you want for yourself. I’ll never agree with anyone that the virtual line is beneficial. Don’t even bother trying to argue otherwise with me.
"Getting out of the way is naturally unpredictable so don’t do it.

Faster drivers will overtake you on their own. If you want to facilitate an overtake stay on your normal line and once you see in your mirror that they have moved to the inside you can brake earlier than usual to allow them to pass you more easily. 

But don’t move off-line like you see on TV, it is not required and it is usually going to cause more trouble than it prevents"
"You are luckier than me! On my first race I ended upside down on the grass. I wasn't cautious enough on turn 1 and hit the tyre of the car ahead with my tyre. He was fine, I was sent flying."

"Follow-up question: 
How/when would I know if someone protested me?"
"Don’t get out of the way. Instead, don’t fight the overtake. If you’re not confident and see a faster car approaching, just keep running your normal line and let them overtake you organically. Getting out of the way will be too unpredictable and cause crashes. Wait for the following car to show their nose on the inside and as you both get on the brakes, brake just a touch harder or lift off the throttle a little before you get on the brakes so they pass you earlier into the corner. This way you can just tuck in and stay close to them for the corner exit. You’ll lose less time and you will have helped to facilitate a safer overtake."
"Great advice. Had a lap car stop at the beginning of the straight to ""help"" as a battle for position approached. I went inside expecting lap car to drift back outside to the racing line, instead I rear ended the lap car."
"In rookies I wouldn't worry to much about protests unless you really did something intentionally bad, just have fun learning and let mistakes and such happen 🤘🤘"
"You’ll usually get an email a few days later. I’ve been protested a couple times throughout the years - genuine or meatheaded mistakes. Don’t worry too much about it, iRacing is always professional and they want you to keep racing so you keep spending money with them anyways."
How though? What series was that?
~1530 corners wipes out a lot of old Xs.
Guess I know what I'm doing tomorrow then.
"It would have been more in the past.... assuming you had room to go higher. Still massive gains.

The most you can gain i believe is 5.99. going from 1.00 of the previous class to 4.99 of the next class."

This was the Indycar Series at Nurburgring. Runs every 2 hours and is a B Class series
"Yep. And given that, if I’m not mistaken, your safety rating is a calculation of incidents over your last 2,400 corners; that means that one Indy race at the ‘ring with 0x is pretty much a guaranteed max SR"
"Ah right, 9 laps in Nurburgring. That explains it"
Well not if you have a shit ton of incidents in the prior 900 corners.

"Better than ""go over"" which is what was called to that one guy."
"Y’all joke, but even in class B, people don’t slow down on a yellow, no matter what. So you really put yourself and the track in more danger if you actually caution. 

That’s the unfortunate truth."
"Lol as long as you didn't take green out it's all good. If you did it would have been all ""I can't beleivevyou blahblahblahblah brakes on yellow flag""

:joy: Yeah I was a bit overzealous in my first Radical race, I'll be more aware next time"
"I still firmly believe iRacing should be removing these guys from the race. I do not care what your country’s internet infrastructure is like. If your connection is this bad, it’s not suitable for online racing. Plain and simple. Maybe it’s a guy on WiFi. Maybe the guy has 10 TVs all streaming Netflix at 4K. Maybe his provider just sucks and it’s the fastest plan he can get. I don’t care. The other drivers in the session should not have to deal with this as it ruins the experience for everyone around them. It makes no sense to me to keep 1 laggy driver around but not care about the impact it has on the many drivers around them."
"Connection issues aside, it looks like he was blindly following the racing line."
"Looks like glitching due to connection issues.  Frustrating as hell, but not something that can be protested as it doesn't seem intentional/malicious."
"If you are new it would be worth reading the sporting code section on protests. Protests are not intended for racing incidents. I've included a link, section 9 (page 23). 

[https://ir-core-sites.iracing.com/members/pdfs/20210504-iRacing\_Sporting\_Code\_dated\_Apr\_23\_2021.pdf](https://ir-core-sites.iracing.com/members/pdfs/20210504-iracing_sporting_code_dated_apr_23_2021.pdf)"
"It looks like he was blindly following the racing line and didn’t leave space on the inside. But he was also ahead (connection issues notwithstanding). This is a “racing incident” in my humble opinion. It sucks but not something I would personally protest. I am not in the camp of protesting every driver who is technically in the wrong; but rather focusing on drivers who are intentionally malicious or egregiously wrong. It could also have happened simply because he misjudged how close you were and was trying to close the door on you which is something he can do in this situation; again, he was ahead. (Though in rookies, tbh, I doubt anyone was trying to pull off a move; probably just racing like it’s a test drive with people around)"
"8x, lol,  don't go oval! I'll mean get used to it.  They'll have more waiting for ya."
It looked like a racing incident to me. The best thing you can do to get better is to turn off the racing line ASAP.
"Nah. It’s a racing incident. Mistakes happen. You’ll almost certainly make some too. I report dudes that are doing intentional stuff. Incidents like are where you learn about studying other drivers habits and awareness, limits of netcode, etc. sucks, but it’s the only way to learn."
"Had a guy I was fighting for a few laps while he blinked like 13 times per lap, very short blinks. Wasn't really a problem. But then right coming into a turn he vanished for the whole turn. It was like a horror movie about to jump scare you but the music builds, and then nothing happens... and then they get you with they delayed jump scare. His car came back in like an inch from my car in front and covered most of my fov."
"i encountered my first blinking driver in a dirt oval race, luckily he was behind me but he’d disappear into the corner then reappear mid corner meaning nobody could pass"
"You were overtaking/passing.  It is your responsibility to make sure you do it safely.  If you watch the replay from the other driver’s perspective, he probably didn’t see you.  You have the line one (apparently he did too because he was on it), you had to have known he was going to following the line.  You can protest, but nothing will come of it.  If anything, you were at fault."
""" **I ended up getting x8 from all of the following collisions.** ""  


That is not a thing in iRacing, the maximum you can get from an accident in a time window is x4"
"There’s no block. You see blinkers,’play it safe. Protesting is for intentional stuff. You don’t get the incidents removed so doesn’t really matter anyways"
The game should have a voting system like survivor. If you blink too much you get voted off the island lol.
The wrecker was blinking which I've recently lit learned is protestable but I don't think to it's instance is worth it just because of the wreck. Mostly just a racing incident. He (and you in the long run) should probably turn off the racing line and maybe it wouldn't have happened. He was basically glued to it which led straight into you.
"Well, iRacing is the only one to blame here."
"Iracing kinda sucks, I love it but I hate it.. every good racer and every bad but patient racer can do well but the track marshal.system is bogus"
"I'm new based in NA. Every other race, there's someone from Europe or Australia. 250+ ping. I get close racing, but it's super off putting when you're behind someone blipping in and out."
Yes.
"What a toxic community exists in iRacing. I regret the day I paid 100 dollars only to encounter some of the most abusive, demeaning, offensive, and racist behavior from participants in that game. The sense of “community” is almost nonexistent(There is only bullying). No one offers or provides advice or just talk on improving and becoming an efficient driver. All I see are posts about protesting and eliminating other players. Without a doubt, it’s the worst experience I’ve had in a video game in over 30 years of online gaming. This is all my personal opinion, but the majority seem to be despicable people."
Blinking is also caused if that player has bad frames. Some people have graphics cranked but their PC can't handle it.
">Should I file a protest for something like this? I'm new so I'm a little weary of protesting people.

2 things I can best advise

1: read the sporting code as advised in other comments
2: take the advice you've been giving about your ""incident"" dust off grow up and register for another race, you were racing rookies not the indy500."
"Looks like his internet is so bad he had no idea where you were. It might have looked different on his end.
That said, pings like this should be removed from the race (without penalty) it is impossible to race these guys."
Not the topic but how u get the line 😀 im New and damn ist hard on New Maps without 😅
You have to give a lot more space around someone with a connection this poor.
no
No ill intent or malicious driving there. Just bad racecraft and connection issues. Not protest worthy whatsoever. Protest worthy are only intentional punts or otherwise malicious behavior. Also please turn off the racing line
"yeah, wont return until they start booting these people with k-mart connections"
"Complete agree, I encountered my first blinking player and I basically couldn’t pass without potentially ruining my race. And then I still had to stay back enough to react in case he spun and blinked. Was more frustrating than just getting taken out turn 1."
"iRacing does remove the users if you protest it. Their lag-kicker should absolutely be more aggressive though for an in-race solution, if it doesn't resolve within 5 mins of going out of tolerance they should be booted, would clean most of them out before gridding."
"Having them blink, or worse, bounce up into the air, makes this SO much worse. You can come around the turn and not have ANY clue someone is there and then WHAM. Not to mention the distraction of the blinking and bouncing."
"Same. Frequent 250-600 Ping players in every lobby. And they ruin every race, every time without exception. NZ and Brazil players in EU servers should not be possible and is not possible basically in every other fucking game for a good reason."
This. 100% agree.
The thing you are missing which I just noticed. Is they alternate what server the race is on. I raced in a European server for f3 and it said I had 200 ping. I have 900 mbps down and up load speed which is way faster than necessary for good connection. But to them I could be blinking and a shit connection. It’s so terrible not just over blinking but the net code is so violent with people connected rrom another country

I don’t know what the fuck y’all are smoking, I’ve had cars fall from the air out of no where on top of me, getting a 4x. This is a reoccurring thing… I’m literally getting punished, because some stranger doesn’t have a stable internet connection. In what fucking world does that make sense?

Is that racing line right? If so TIL that that curb isn't the limit and why I am so slow through there.
"Yeah, I couldn’t tell where he was so I decided to go to the inside to avoid crashing into him when he was blipping in and out of existence. My hope was that way he could at least see me if I couldn’t see him"
"Yeah if that’s the racing line, what’s the point of having the curb to the right? When not just extend it to the grass?"

Last line. This is one thing I am firm on reporting each time it happens. It is blatantly obvious you're having connection issues from a drivers perspective because everyone else disappears. 

It is not the lobbies problem you have bad internet, their races shouldn't be put in jeopardy because you can't figure out your internet issues or you live somewhere that your ISP can't remain stable."
It's not the glitching I'd be protesting. It's the fact the driver was blindly following the racing line and did not leave space for OP who was clearly on the inside and far enough up that he needed space from other drivers. Ignorance and lack of awareness isn't an excuse and is malicious as far as I am concerned.
"Link the current sporting code, not the old one from April 2021. It's mostly the same, but the most recent one is the relevant one.

[https://www.iracing.com/iracing-official-sporting-code/](https://www.iracing.com/iracing-official-sporting-code/)"
"I did read that, but blocking somebody by slamming them into a wall doesn’t really seem to me like a racing incident?"
I would argue that he should have been aware OP was there. As OP was along side him leading into the corner entrance and due to blinking cars better line gained some lead toward the apex. He should have left room until he was in the clear.
I’ve been leaving it on the first day or two of running a new track just to learn the track and then go from there to find more speed
Best answer here.
"At fault for being in the space? I following the edge of the course, he cut completely into me. I stayed side by side with him through the arc of the turn. No movement I made caused a collision there? Maybe I could have figured he was stupid and couldn’t go wheel to wheel but how am I at fault?

https://preview.redd.it/xhbkybt6u2dc1.jpeg?width=2436&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48daf2af4c3e95361d4581e189c7f618f68c77bb"
From the initial contact I got x4. And then from the damage to my wheels trying to make it back I understeered and one of the other guys ran into me from behind so yes it is a thing to get x8 as a result of a collision.
"Yikes… honestly I find that the community is very helpful and welcoming.   Now Reddit is another story.. if you want to stick with the good crowd, stay on the iRacing forums. Not here. That’s my advice."
"Yeah. I have a solid fiber connection, and everything is wired. And I had some weird glitch with my PC (never did Diagnose it). I was getting normal FPS (what I normally see in a race) but a whole bunch of stuff was screwy. My overlays were lagging, my shift lights on my wheel were super delayed and laggy, and Crew Chief was in slow motion and choppy. And other drivers were telling me that I was blinking in and out (so I ended up pulling over to let the field pass and finished the race at the back). That was definitely not a connection issue but some sort of issue on my end that I suspect was CPU related; like some process loading up my CPU or something."
Gonna be honest I went back to my cockpit view and when I looked to see where he was with track IR just before the point of commitment I didn’t even see him. I guess he blipped out of existence right there. So that’s why I was so shocked when he appeared alongside and slammed into me
"We had the same situation in 3h VRS Spa. P3 blinking like crazy, at best he was invisible all the way from blanchimont to the chicane ending."
"And if you stay back enough, you get attacked from behind without knowing exactly where to go to defend your position, because there might be an invisible driver there."
This sounds like a great idea to me.
Having a high ping does not make you blink.
"This inspires the possibility that in the case of a large ping, of there being a tone and the spotter/steward warns both drivers to distance themselves laterally, give space, and if done withing say 5 seconds both go on, but if still within each others space, then both must slow down, maybe the one with higher ping slows more, or the one with a faster average or best lap time is ahead after the slow down."

"The first time I drive a new combination, I always go wide on corner exists to learn where the track limits are."
"‘is blatantly obvious you're having connection issues from a drivers perspective because everyone else disappears.’

This is not true as it completely depends on which packets are being dropped. If something is uploading on his connection the upstream packets will be dropped and he will be blinking but if there’s no problem with the downstream (and usually people have a lot more download bandwidth) everything will look fine to him."
"Not saying you are wrong, but that section deals with Pro series and the like. I don't see anything in the sporting code that requires the ordinary user to maintain a certain level of connectivity.

Given the vagaries of internet connections and the sheer number if users, I think it would take a lot of instances of poor connections for iRacing to take punitive action against an average racer.

Different for Pro, etc., as there are far fewer users and, I presume, iRacing personnel are able to better monitor that in real time."
It doesn’t necessarily mean their internet sucks. When the races are on European servers many Americans blink and cause net code the same way they do it to us on American servers. No matter how strong or fast your internet this could be you when not racing on a local server.
The part you mentioned about everyone else disappearing when you have connection issues isn’t accurate. I’ve had people tell me I’m blinking during a race out of nowhere and all other drivers were still visible. Depends on which packets were dropped etc.
Where does that state that a bad connection can be protestable? It states that iRacing can terminate sessions based upon latency.
"I dont see any blocking. I see a green car with barely any overlap attempting an overtake, in the vortex of danger, on a car with a questionable connection."
"He was blinking, meaning connection issues. He might not have saw this incident the same as you. 

If you see blinking like this, you need to do whatever you can to stay safe."
"You can't assume they knew you were there(and therefore believe it was malicious and intentional). This is a rookie series, you'll encounter a lot of people who either have no situational awareness or think because they're a millimeter ahead of you that you're gonna back out because they watch F1."
It just looks like rookies being rookies and not know how to go wheel to wheel. It happens.
"He absolutely should have. But he also doesn’t necessarily need to per the sporting code, as he was on a consistent line. It’s sort of that argument of what’s best vs. the bare minimum required. 

OP also has the option of backing off which, in rookies, is usually the right move. Because these people are basically just doing a time trial with other cars around; expecting them to leave space is expecting too much."

This is the point you should have backed out tbh. That gap was always going to close and you were coming in from tighter line and would need to be slower to make the apex. Just need to be more patient for a better opportunity"
You entered the Vortex of Danger. This is not a protestable incident. Learn from your mistakes and keep racing friend! We were all here once.
"https://preview.redd.it/lvv7isgwz2dc1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bfa827ebe5b6329f6e7e043c0c5df9bfb1d720d

Before the impact, he was in front of you.  There is a respected youtuber and iRacing coach who talks about these sort of things.

It simply was not worth hoping he would get out of your way when he could not see you.  Especially in open wheel where a slight bump could disable your car or end your race."
Did you look at the replay?  Could he see you or were you in his blind spot?  You couldn’t see him or you would not have pushed into his line of travel.  He was in front of you and you were behind him.
"You came inside the racing line, and cut the inside line of the faster car ahead of you. This is 100% your fault. I know this is frustrating to hear as a new driver, but it is true. You were not side by side, you were behind him and hit him from his blind spot (aka vortex of danger). "
"You were behind him(not side by side equally) and in his blind spot (vortex of danger), he was glitching like crazy (makes for a very sad day of racing for anyone around them) and even with this knowledge you felt that an inside pass at that corner where everyone tries to clip the edge of the track was a good place to place yourself. 

Yeah, its was your fault. Glitching like that means you stay away from them or you crash out when they reappear on top of you. Learn and move on."
That is two different incidents mate
IRacing rookie trying to tell us how it works lol
"Thank you for your words! I think it’s Reddit, not the game. I’ll follow your advice."
"Yeah exactly and for him you might have looked to be on another point of the track from where you really were.
Though he just took the shortest line without being remotely considerate of other cars.
If your connection is that bad you should be extra careful.
I’d say pretty bad awareness from him but the ping might be the most contributing factor"
"Exactly, I’d rather be taken out turn 1 from a Verstappen wannabe than drive behind a blinking driver"
Plenty times high ping is synonymous with poor connection to the server leading to blinking..
"I’m not experiencing any packet loss, did you read the comment before replying?

100% between other clients and the server, has absolutely nothing to do with packet loss on my end.

How about don’t let people with poor internet connections, when the netcode breaks under unstable conditions, play the game in the first place... I don’t see how y’all just accept that shit isn’t a problem. But hey, y’all continue to pay for that 20 year old, outdated game and eat that shit up. Absolutely no right to complain about anything right? We only gobble cock here.

Keep on racking those charges, you’ll get that rain next year, maybe. 👍"
That’s a good plan. I’m literally one week in but this took me from mid 30s to mid 27s in one session.
"I have 6 successful connection protests sent in under competition issue that all have the successful email sent. Whether it was a warning or something else, the driver is now aware that their connection is an issue."
"Don't know why you're being downvoted. What you wrote is true. In almost every race I've been in there was that one guy with a 300+ ping and sure enough, he was blinking like hell. All while showing 99 connection quality."
"I don't know where it says it, but I do know that I've been protested for bad connection before and they told me and I got a warning"
">iRacing may

**removing a participant**"
Would you like all my successful bad connection protest emails forwarded to you for further proof?
I don’t know where else I would have been he saw me right behind him the previous turn in his mirror and gaining?
I think Randy’s video series should be mandatory watching as part of the rule book
I still see my front wheels in front of his rear wheels. That seems pretty alongside to me? Everybody out here downvoting the shit out of anything I say but I just want clarity
"Update I looked back into the replay in cockpit view (I have TrackIR and glanced over) and this was the same moment I looked to see if I had clearance for the move. Which on my screen I did thinking the other guy was him.

You guys are right and it was a racing incident. Connection issues suck"
We were literally side by side what do you mean pushed into his line of travel. I was already there
All of which followed as a result of the incident. Idk what you want me to tell you. I’m not out here to teach you how definitions work but you really seem to be struggling with it.
Shouldn’t have to tell you what the definition of “following” is. It means something that occurred after or as a result of by the way. I don’t see how driving licenses makes a difference on your ability to understand the english language.
">Plenty times high ping is synonymous with poor connection to the server

False, high ping is almost always caused by a long distance to the server.

You can have a low ping if you live close to server, but still be blinking if you're dropping packets because of bad WiFi.

Latency says nothing about connection quality."
"where did I blame you for the packet loss? It sounds like your experience with iRacing has not been good, why continue? That's all I'm saying. You are making a lot of assumptions. And yeah, I will continue paying for it because it's the best sim racing game that exists, and it brings me a lot of enjoyment. In 700+ races I've had maybe two or three incidents where a blinker changed how I'd otherwise drive. I've never been taken out. I'm not saying it isn't a problem with that, just that it hasn't been my experience, and that you should realize that even when an accident isn't your fault it doesn't mean you couldn't have done anything to avoid it. 

Besides, nobody is forcing you to play, so I'm not exactly sure who you are raging at. Literally nobody is begging you to stay. Those that do stay because it's the most realistic simulator that exists. If that isn't important to you, it sounds like you have an easy choice to quit."
"Well the guy I was talking with was cool. But primarily a lot of this sub will downvote to hell over semantics. There’s some hardcore latency v quality people. But fact remains, you see someone blinking, ping will be shit 90% of the time"
"Iracing can do that. It doesn't state as a result of a protest. 

Its normal for an online gaming service to kick a participant because of connection issues. There is nothing in that paragraph to say it's protestable by another player."
"OK, so it's protestable. But that is the wrong paragraph to use as an example. What that paragraph is a standard T&C from an online gaming service in case of a poor connection, and normally an automated process.

A protest is a user driven action. Quite a difference."
"Hi, I’m curious, what section do you list for the violation? I’m away from my PC at the moment but from what I can recall in the protest drop down I don’t remember seeing a section of the SC that would cover bad connection?"
"He, like you, is probably running the racing line given he was glued to it. Was probably fixated on that rather than checking his mirrors regularly. 

Its pretty clear this wasn’t a malicious incident, and both drivers can learn something from it"
"1. The crash not protestable because it's not intentional - for wrecks, only intentional wrecking is protestable.

2. It's a rookie series, and if you want ANY success in iracing whatsoever, the most important thing to learn in rookies is not ""who is a fault"" but ""how could I have avoided the incident"". Fault does not matter, you will lose SR and IR all the same. I've seen people in rookies who race clean but too hard, and wonder why they always get crashed. 

If you expect people to race like on TV, you will not make it out of D-Class."
"You have to learn when to accept you were equally responsible for an accident, or completely at fault.  Learn and move on.  Otherwise you are going to find yourself in the 400 IR races raging at everyone and hating the game.  I see it all the time.  One of my license classes is in the 400 area and there are a lot of angry, miserable people who hate life in those races.  Be nice, wait until you can watch from everyone's perspective and determine how not to repeat the situation.  Nearly every time it is because you caused the accident or didn't avoid it.  5% of the time is was completely unavoidable.  There are several videos out there that give hints on predicting accidents before they happen.  I apologize all the time because of stuff I do and when something is clearly someone else's fault or I get wrecked in a pack because of someone else...  I say ""Well that sucks"" and I move on.  Raging at people and arguing doesn't' go far.  You will find yourself racing the same guys all the time.  Don't get the rep of a bad sport.     


As far as people down rating you, I did not.   I disagree with your assessment of the situation.    
When protesting, make sure and include every angle and voice if there is any.  The marshals reviewing it are not going to look for a reason to get someone a bad mark.  You need to present your case and make it good.  Some things are just racing.  It happens.  In this case, I think it was just racing with no malice.  Never assume someone is going to get out of your way."
"So, this is not explicit in the sporting code, but typically in real life racing you don't have a right to space as an overtaking car unless you have significant overlap at the turn in point (some series its the braking point and F1 its whoever is ahead at the apex).  The sporting code in iRacing just says it is the responsibility of the overtaking car to do so safely.  

In this case, it doesn't look like you have any overlap when the blinking car starts to turn in (it is a little hard to tell due to the angle and the blinking though).  If there is any overlap at all its minor.  Sticking your nose in there after the other car already started to turn in is both unsafe and unsportsmanlike.  Even if you did have your fronts even with his rears at the turn in, though, trying a move like that in rookies is asking for a wreck."
"You'll be a lot better off in your racing by assuming that you're not alongside until your front wheels are next to theirs. 


Merely getting your nose next to someone isn't enough to establish a right to space."
Did you look at the replay?  Could he see you?  Did you see him?  It’s not protestable.  iRacing won’t do anything about it.
"Dont argue with these people. They are dumb as rock, they follow some magic youtuber and fly around subreddits yapping about vortex of danger. No this is not protestable, but you are allowed to be there. This is rookies everyone makes stupid mistakes, forget it and move on."
"Behaving like a dickhead is not going to take you anywhere but 👍🏻

Your first post is misleading and I explained that it was not possible what you said originally 🤷🏻‍♂️

Good luck in the future, you’ll need it 😉"
"I see, you’re one of those…

iRacing is able to deduce when an incident follows another insofar as it is directly related. That why you see a message saying an incident and it’s points have been increased to factor in the ‘chained’ incident. If those 8x were *truly* following from the first incident, iRacing limits it, as has been explained to you. 

You understeering from earlier damage and colliding with another car is a totally separate incident and cannot be blamed on the person whose caused the first - that ‘following’ incident is all on you, pal. If you cannot safely get your car back to the pits, that’s your own damn fault and you deserve the second 4x. Whilst it ‘follows’ chronologically, it is an entirely separate incident as far as iRacing and any other steward would be concerned."
"False, more times than not they go hand in hand. Way more times high latency results in packet loss than it doesn’t."
"“… getting into wrecks due to packet loss”
Definitely portrays like I’m the one experiencing packet loss, also a bit specific, no? It isn’t just packet loss thats causing the blinking. It’s the netcode itself, it shouldn’t be a thing to begin with.

If the game is able portray that player to the rest of the players as a blinking bunny hopping mess, they definitely have the capability of removing the player all together. 
What’s the point of keeping this as a “feature” in the game?

That isn’t all you were saying you were sarcastically saying “oh no! So sorry,  then quit playing”. Let’s not back pedal.
Seems to be the thing here, absolutely no nagging the game or devs. Cock gobbles or protests only."
"I place it under competition issue and write a couple sentences (driver constantly flashed in and out the majority of the race, placing those around them in danger) and provide video of the person blinking in and out. I usually take a few laps worth (3) so they can see. 

I am sure from they're end they're able to pull connection data from us as well to verify it."
"I suppose so, I guess iRacing has different definitions than the karting leagues I’ve been a part of"
"Pretty happy with where I’m at, don’t appreciate being corrected on stating something which was correct stated the way it was."
"Alright buddy whatever you say, it’s not like I wasn’t driving safely. My attitude is just fine, if you couldn’t tell I was struggling to understand how I wasn’t already there. When I glanced over I thought I was more than in front so I couldn’t understand how he came back and hit me. Everybody is saying it’s my fault for causing it and I shouldn’t have “tried to overake” which isn’t what happened at all. In fact, when I went into the replay again, this is the blimp view of the same moment I glanced over to my left with TrackIR to check where he was.

https://preview.redd.it/ie5ewzkqa7dc1.jpeg?width=1828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78e589c409897d58e39044da391d92770fd6f698

Guess who doesn’t show up there? Yeah the guy that hit me. So I had assumed that the guy I saw was the guy who was actually in front but he was actually blipping out of existence.

As far as the second one, somebody diving into the corner behind a car already going slower to deal with their understeer is not my problem. I was driving predictably on the way back to the pits and it’s “on the overtaking car to pass safely.”"
High latency will make a bad connection even worse. But it's not synonymous with a bad connection. Which is what I was arguing against
"Don't know what else to say. If you can't avoid wrecks for whatever reason, please leave the service and go back to arcade racing. The service doesn't need more shitty drivers, and certainly doesn't need your childish homophobia. "
Thanks
"Which is funny, because you were a problem for someone else to deal with. While you may be technically correct about the chain of events that resulted in the X8 total… the first X4 is the only relevant argument to make. The rest was under your control.

It’s online racing, you are new. Don’t get worked up over this… trust me."
"Read my edit, where I decided to explain as I think you’ve just commented before I made it."
I dunno. I have yet to see someone blink or explode who I didn’t then check to see a 266 ping 🤷‍♀️
So? Looks like iRacing got what they wanted and the case was dismissed. I don’t see what the point of you posting this all over the place is.
My head hurts
How did they lose it they got what they wanted?
It's an ad for the youtube video they made about it. One of the other threads had it linked
"Great league, can’t recommend it enough! Good group of guys and good races every week."
Great league to call home! Highly recommend stopping by to check it out.
It is the job of the overtaking car to pass in a safe manner. This is the blue cars fault.
You missed the corner but that blue car was in a completely different galaxy with where he was going lol.
You couldn't go right any further and the blue car tracked all the way to the edge of the track regardless.
Blue wasn't making that corner anyway. Not on you
"Yes, you should have used your third eye to predict he was gonna fly into you. Be better"
"Blues fault. Even tho you missed the corner, you never left the racing surface and remained on the outside. He was making the pass and it’s his job to make sure there is enough room for you on the outside and complete the pass cleanly as long as you maintain your line in this situation."
Wrong place wrong time. Don't let it discourage you. Most of the racing is good. Rookies are a little rough. Definitely not on you. Give the sporting code a good read too. There's good stuff in there. It will answer a lot of newcomer questions.
"The Xbox game bar, and I think AMD and Nvidia driver packages include screen capture utils for recording snippets. I use game bar anytime I need to capture a replay to upload.

Additionally, pressing space at the replay screen dismisses the UI so you don't have to zoom in to hide it."
"Yes, your fault for showing us a phone recording of your screen"
"100% Blues fault, but fault doesn't change the outcome.    You are asking the wrong question.

The right question is ""What could I have done better"".   And that applies in every incident, regardless of fault.   

Since you are new, the biggest thing you need to learn to get better finishes is to identify people like this and learn how to avoid them.      If you had been looking in your mirrors you could have seen him coming, and slowed down more.  I'm pretty sure he would have blown off the track in front of you, and you get to keep on racing to a better finish. 

If you can do that, you will likely find yourself with top5 finishes consistently."
[removed]
"Yes, you didn’t miss the apex enough such that you were still on the track to get hit by the next guy blowing through the turn."
No.
This better be a sarcasm post..
Definitely. Blue had committed to his line that goes off the track in to the wall and you got in the way. I recommend checking your mirrors constantly to avoid such accidents in the future.
"No, blue car at fault. He should have taken a shallower line"
Rookies gonna rookie
"Blue cars fault..... this will happen a lot in the beginning. Don't get frustrated, it happens less as you progress"
"Pretty sure the guy who hit you was on a path straight into the wall if they didn't hit you first.

You did absolutely nothing wrong here."
"No. Blue should've left space for you even if they were overtaking. But they didn't make the corner, so their pass is not valid anyway."
"always show the ""chase far"" cam. Its much better for the evaluation of incidents."
Blue car all the way. And he wasn't making that corner.
"If the blue car said that's on you, he's smokin something we all probably want hahaha."
This is so not your fault that I question if this is a troll post.
100% the blue cars' fault.
Just typical rookie shenanigans
This is da wei
Blue wasn’t making that corner if green was there or not. This is almost bordering on intentional wrecking
"Green didn't miss the corner. The racing line, sure, but there's no such rule. Green did nothing wrong."
Haha. I just learned that the only way I can watch replays was if I saved it right after I finished the race. Good to know for future races.
"While I generally agree, I don't think there was anything that could reasonably be done in this scenario short of slamming on the brakes so they could hit the wall instead of the green car. I'm not sure the blue would have even been in their mirrors with the angle they were taking."
"I sent this to my boss and he said it was my fault, so I wanted some input"
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"It's rookie MX-5, lol. Blue came in hot and understeered off the track. Green was just unlucky to be there. It's blue's fault for sure, but intentional is a stretch."
"There's a setting in you can change in the .ini files that will make a pop-up appear after every session,  asking if you want to save the replay."
"It's more that if green had braked effectively before the turn, they would have turned in and hit the apex, so they would have been long gone by the time blue arrived."
"Hindsight is 20/20, but that doesn't mean you can't use it for the future.   The pattern is going to repeat itself enough that anyone who races for awhile is going to automatically start to pick it up, but if you look at what happened from a what could I have done different angle, rather than a fault angle, you will learn quicker.

It's his first race, so the odds of him seeing that coming are going to be extremely low.  But the only thing you can do in those situations is try to recognize them and avoid it.   Fault isn't going to fix your car or put you back on the track.

It's served me well at any rate.  I'll curse the guy for wrecking me, but then I look at what I could have done different after the anger fades."

"Your boss's fault, he's not making that corner either"
Is he the blue car?
Submit and let iracing decide if it’s intentional or not. That’s the point of protests
"""Just don't make mistakes"" is valid advice of course, but hardly relevant here."
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
That is irrelevant to you claiming it's pretty much intentional wrecking. That claim is still ridiculous. Protests being there to stop intentional wrecking doesn't mean any crash with heavy contact is intentional
"You can't control other drivers but you can learn what you could do better next time, which is my interpretation of the comment these replies are under. If you're in control of the car, you won't often end up in the position of green or blue, because you'll understand what inputs to use to correct the mistake before you're at the edge of track limits on the outside of a corner. This is OP's first race in rookie MX-5, we're not nitpicking a rare mistake of a seasoned pro, lol."
Never make mistakes and avoid anyone that does and also never sim race and you'll never have any issues
Love the livery
love the colours 10/10 well done
Nice livery
"I'd recommend GSRC [https://race.tgsrci.com/home](https://race.tgsrci.com/home)

There is quite a few, probably best searching ""leagues"" on the Australian iRacing community Facebook pages"
Thanks!
3 bad races and it's already a suspected spell?
"Part of sim racing is learning how to avoid the stupid shit. This comes with experience.

In real life racing, you crash and even if you don’t have injuries it’s extremely painful. You also need to either spend thousands of dollars on fixing your car or don’t race anymore. 

These elements don’t exist in sim racing is why you have idiots doing stupid shit.

Becoming a stupid shit avoider is paramount to being a successful sim driver. 

Just a few hours ago I was racing FF1600 myself at Phoenix, a short tight twisty track. I was around 6th place in the top split so behind the super fast guys. Watching these guys lap back markers, they don’t take stupid risks and don’t put their cars in dumb positions. They know when pull out of move or to brake early and know if they just wait a few moments and put pressure on the car in front that they’ll bin it within a few corners. 

You need to learn how to do this. 95% of incidents can be avoided.

Until you accept that you are part of the problem you won’t improve and will continue to be frustrated."
"Racing is unpredictable. You will have good and bad stretches. I think I had 10 in a row once where it didn’t end well through bad luck wrong place wrong time type stuff. I’m 5.2k so it’s not a common occurrence, but it happens to the best of us sometimes too. Brush it off and look forward to the next one."
I lost .7 SR in one god damn race recently. I'm very annoyed lately. All I want is clean results. I can handle being down a few places if it means I actually finish and keep getting progress.
"Much more than that but i dont remember specifics beyond these 3, and i didnt wanna make a post that was *THAT* long just complaining

Realisitcally ive had maybe one or two races in the last month or two that were uneventful"
"I understand that Im the common denominator, and I do what I can to rewatch my races and see what I can do differently, but its still a mental block sorta thing. 

I think it happens the most to me when Im in a fight against someone else and I miss something coming up the road. 

Youre definitely right that learning how to read a race ahead of me is much less painful on sim vs IRL so its just a matter of time before it clicks for me I hope lmao"
"Yeah I will be, you only lose when you quit and I dont like to lose, but yeah its definitely rough especially at the start of your journey 😂"
"Bad stretches happen, I’ve fallen from 2.2k to 1.6k in a week, haven’t had a positive race in almost two now, just power thru and try n have fun while doing it"
"Yeah it sounds like you’re not looking far enough up the road which is very common mistake / habit even experienced drivers can fall into. Generally you want to be looking past the next apex. Your FOV may also need tweaking.

If you’ve got funds I would suggest triple monitors. They make this a lot easier"
"I dont have much for funds, im limited to a single 27”~ monitor, but i use racelabs for radar and crew chief to try make up for it. 

Triples is for sure #1 on my list of upgrades when I can tho lolol"
"Getting even a 32"" ultra wide is a giant difference.

I just spent a month and a half on my normal 27"" -- problem is it's 27"" corner to corner and only 24"" horizonal.

Spent a weekend racing on my 60 hz 32"" ultra wide work monitor and literally my 2nd lap at a new personal best pace for the track I was on.

It allows a massively wider FOV which let's you see turns better.

I immediately went and bought a VR headset lol. (Don't have space for another ultra wide monitor on my desk)"
Congrats! Meanwhile I have not completed an oval race without a major wreck in a few days.
"Saw your post the other night, you're killing it dude. Keep it up!"
Thank you! That's how it is most of the time lol
Thank you brother!
"I don’t think this was intentional, I think he hit the gas too hard and screwed up his turn back onto the track"
To me it looks like he tried to whip the back around and turned the wheel one too many times. I've definitely done that before 😆
"""Don't attribute to malice that which can be perfectly explained by stupidity."""
It must've been a real long while because it didn't happen here either.
PROTEST SUSTAINED I AM NOT CRAZY
"At first I saw what you saw, but if you look again he stops to let the orange car go by but then turns too much into you. I think he just made a big mistake. It wouldn't make too much sense to let another car go by and single you out when you were nowhere near him when he spun."
"If the stewards come back and tell me that so be it, but I just don’t think it’s what happened, not least of which since I got ran off the track after the initial contact"
"I had a race last week with a standing start and the guy one position ahead of me clearly had his wheel turned 360° to the left when the green lights went on. We both nearly died at the start, I lost a few positions, but I managed to avoid contact, shit happens, life goes on.

I'm 90% certain that this happened here, too."
"I’ve done plenty of stupid shit on the track. You send a quick sorry and move on. That didn’t happen here so I’m less inclined to chalk it up to stupidity. But, if the stewards tell me he was just a moron nothing I can do about it."
"It's an unsafe rejoin which is protestable, but that doesn't mean he intentionally wrecked you "
"Not everyone races with a mic, or with chat turned on, or with their keyboard nearby to type."
"I'm in VR with chat muted, I'll never send ""a quick sorry"" during a race... OP is delusional anyway."
I believe it's C Class or higher. You can qualify all week as many times as you want.
"Qualify? Is it not going to be like NIS, where it’s open to anyone with that class or higher?"
The Indy 500 is special in that it splits by qualifying time instead of iRating. There will be qualifying sessions throughout the week leading up to the event. Everyone that is C class and above will still be able to take part in the event
"Interesting. I’m relatively new to iRacing, when was the last time they had the indy500? Wouldn’t it make sense to sandbag your qualifying time to get into slower splits?"
2022 was the last Indy 500. People can try sandbagging but they'd likely end up with other people that are sandbagging as well.
"The real ""goal"" is to be in the top split. It's a rare case where top split isn't just people with tons of iRating. I've made top split broadcasts with <3k iRating back in the day,"
"Just don't sandbag too much, or you'll end up in the half ""slowest qualifiers"" half ""highest irating with no qualifying attempt"" split, which is pure chaos"
How many drivers were in each split
I’m sure people spend hours trying to craft the perfect line to maximize speed. Is it a set time each day or does it vary
"The max was 33, like the real Indy 500"
Indy500 Quali will go every 30 or 60 minutes for around a week before the event. You can run as many attempts as you wish (unless they change it this year). There are probably people already starting to work on qualifying setups lol.
"Yeah I usually do 2 runs and get a decent time, and get thrown into a split that is 70% low iR people who grinded Q all week. Then they almost all immediately crash because they can't put much more than 4 laps together and about 7 people finish the race. 

I might try to not Q this time and go into one of the sorted by irating but nonQ splits."
That’s dope! Did they also have the coke 600 running during the week too?
"So they are just going to take your best qualifying time during the week of qualifying and then when you do the race they will base it off that time? Too many questions, but will the track temp and weather be the same for each session?"
The iRacing Indy 500 is normally the week before the real 500 and the Coke 600 runs the week of the real event
Qualifying will likely be locked weather. The best 4 lap average that you do during the week will be your time that is used for grid position/session splitting.
We're about to put some miles in aren't we?
"Nice sheet! I made one that looks close to that until I found Sassy's Enduro Manger sheet they made. Based our 24 D24 off of it.

https://preview.redd.it/vakmzjk595dc1.png?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d85430c880238e780c03d380ed533261b09f859"
One thing about your sheet timing tho. Green flag/24 hour clock start will be closer to 48 past the hour instead of 40. Just a heads up
This is far more advanced than our one pinned discord comment I usually use showing who is qualifying and who gets into cars at rough intervals
"Yep,  That plus any server launch delays."
"Yeah exactly. And judging by how long this ""hot""fix is taking... Who knows what'll happen tomorrow."
"Only recommendation is to go as big as you can.  AMD's x3D CPUs should be on your radar as that extra cache is incredible for games, especially iRacing. "
"I’m on a Reverb G2 with a 7950X3D and a 3080. I’m running the recommended settings on the VR optimization guide on the forums with a couple things like shader quality and car count turned down slightly (I think medium shaders and 32 cars, not at my PC at the moment), along with openXR toolkit foveated rendering enabled in quality/wide mode. I primarily run road in GT3/IMSA with multiple car types on track, and I’m good for 90fps at all times even on the tracks that typically cause issues in VR like Zandvoort and Barcelona. Hopefully that provides a frame of reference for you, slightly turning down the settings and enabling foveated rendering were important for guaranteeing 90fps in the worst case scenarios."
"im also pretty concluded on the cpu, however its the gpu's that im not really sure yet. Unfortunately there arent really any benchmarks, that i can find, in iracing vr :("
"AMD should be a no go for VR because it can't do Single Pass Stereo.  That single checkbox gives a decent amount of CPU/GPU headroom with practically 0 negatives.  Benchmarks will always be tricky due to the extra variable in HMD, so it always becomes CPU + GPU + HMD. 

For me, I'm aiming at a 4070 Ti Super to upgrade my 3060 Ti as 8 GB VRAM is too limiting in VR. "
"To be honest  im also leaning towards either 4070ti super or 4080 super depending on local pricing, just wanted to be sure there hasnt been any major updates to amds vr performance i hadnt heard about."
"always nvidia for vr, specially in iracing.

that being said i was running beautifully on a 3080ti. you can get one for a song these days on local classifieds.

or if worried about warranty, get a used 4070ti or 4080 on local classifieds. as the new line should free up some ""new"" 40xx on the used market.

thats where id be if i didnt splurge for a 4090.

fyi the 3080ti vs 4090 experience is negligible with a quest 3 or g2...sure i upped a few settings and aliased a bit better with super sampling, but it made no real difference for enjoyment or racing perf.

the 3080ti/3090 is somewhere in the 4070ti speed range iirc. the 40 series is super odd, the price / perf is all over the place."
"You probably need to be more specific about what feelings you are looking for?  IR only transmits the forces that an actual steering wheel IRL would receive, where as almost every other sim injects under/oversteer effects.  Using haptics and shakers can bridge that gap, but IRFFB is the only program I'm aware of to add those into the actual wheel, but I also found while it added feeling I kinda liked, it also felt odd, so I ended up not using it, and just have IR more time.  I have the 8nm CSL DD, and with that base I personally find, running lower than suggested (via the auto FFB function) forces really help me feel the details.  (not a clipping issue, auto keeps me below that already, but I am tweaking the FFB per car)."
"You're device is probably ill-configured from your other racing games. I have a DD1 that feels spectacularly smooth, so you might need a different profile for your other games vs iRacing."
"INT is the traditional filter for what you’re trying to address. All of the other filters affect how the wheel behaves when it moves. INT is more about what the wheel is moving in response to. A little bit can help with the notchiness. Even more will get the wheel to feel more and more like it’s connected to rubber on the other end, but it’ll smooth over the details."
I gave up on Fanatec and got VRS. Super happy now and just wish I had switched earlier.
"To be completely honest, I've left the FFB stock and I haven't really touched the settigns. And I've been happy with that. So my feedback probably won't help you

What cars have you been driving? The FFB on the MX 5 is going to be super floaty no matter what you do. It's just a very floaty car."
"I'm aware that its only putting out steering rack forces, thats not what I mean. Rather the notchiness from outputting a 60Hz signal on a 400Hz output device. I have to increase INT up to 10 to minimize that.

Just testing iRFFB with all effects set to 0. Feels way more smooth with INT<6. Need to decide whether the increase in ffb latency is acceptable I guess."
This seems like what you need
"Different hardware, but I do not notice a notchy feeling between acc, ams2 or IR."
"Go try all three without damping, friction and interpolation and youll immediately feel what I mean.
Had the csl dd previously, its exactly the same"
"You just doubled the pace of your car, which has doubled the size of your mistakes as well as the potential bad outcomes of those mistakes. It takes practice.

Drive the slow cars to learn how to race. You need to learn how to drive the car, obviously, but the biggest takeaway from the slow stuff is how to race and handle a pack of cars on a tiny strip of asphalt. How and when to position yourself and really work on developing racecraft.  

It will help, of course, but the porche is an animal in and of itself and will take seat time, even if you drive the others for two more years. You will still have to put in seat time in order to learn how to drive the porche competitively being one of the more popular series on the service. That and gt3 are sure to humble anyone who hasn't been racing them."
"It'll take far more than a couple days to learn a new car. Tons more power, no tc or abs, rear engine. It's a completely different driving style compared to the miata/gr86. Probably new tracks for you too. Just be patient and keep at it. Alternatively, you could try to run gt4 instead. Less of a leap from your current skillset"
PCUP4LIFE!
If your goal is to get to a B license.you could always run advanced Mazda...
"I have been racing Mazda MX5 and Toyota GR86 and needed to step up to continue gaining  MPR now that I'm in C licence.

Looked at the marketplace and current race series this week and decided a big enough step up would be the GT4 class. Chose the Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 MR and instantly felt the power difference. 

Maybe straight to GT3 was too big a step for you and might be best to learn the GT4 cars 1st?"
I'm in exactly the same boat. I'm just convincing myself that pcup drivers are really dedicated and experienced. Especially since there's an actual esports tournament for pcup. So far I've mainly been practicing because my lack of pace is actually dangerous. I have to drive really hard just to stay out of people's way. Currently doing ~2:10-2:11s around road america. Seems that the fast guys do around 2:07-2:08
"Feel free to tough it out with the P Cup, loads of people do. My advice would be to juno in GT4s for a season or 2, it's a bit faster than the cars you had been driving but they are slower than the P Cup, so you have more time to correct mistakes. Plus you have assists which will stop you making silly mistakes whilst learning the limits of mechanical grip."
"GT3 and Pcup is just way more popular under the hardcore drivers, so the comp is way higher! 
I just made the jump from FF1600 (2100iR) which i almost always finish 1-3 to GT3. At the Gt3 races I even struggle to make top 10 at 1800 SOF.     
      
Competition is just way stronger and you have to get used to the car."
"I take it you're talking about the Porsche Cup? The 992 Cup car is extremely unforgiving. I read on here that it's the hardest car to drive in the game. I love Porsche 911s, and I like a challenge, so I thought I'd give it a go.

I lost 25% of my iR and 40% of my SR in one week at Sebring. The car is a killer. Unrecoverable snap oversteer in high speed corners, terrible understeer in slow corners, and brakes that are super easy to lock and send you straight on into the gravel. Every moment in that car is stressful, you're on a knife edge the whole time.

It's undeniably satisfying when you get the hang of it, but even when you stop causing accidents yourself, there are still people having accidents all around you, and it's hard to stay out of trouble.

If you're looking to earn a B license, maybe the Advanced Mazda series would be a better choice."
"Stick with it, don’t care about your IR for a bit. This car will teach you a lot, will make other cars easier."
"This post drove me crazy. 

1. Porsch 
2. Porsh 
3. 922

It's Porsche (pronounced Poor-shuh)

And it's a 992 Cup."
"You didn't splurge for the 'e'. If you buy the 'e', it comes with extra pace."
Mistake = sbin so its understandable
"You’re not going to get that experience if you’re sticking to slower cars, I’m sorry. It only carry’s over so much, but honestly gt3 and Mazda’s is just a whole different game all together."
I honestly treated classes like a badge of my skill level. now I’m not sure if it works that way. lots of B class dudes doing stupid things and lots of D class actually showing good sport. would like more input and opinions on whether it’s a reasonable “goal” to go up classes. I’m having fun racing regardless
"You then get into the dark arts of tuning! I do not have enough knowledge to get the best out of a car/track I steered clear and went for fixed GT4. 

But a good shout for anybody less anxious about tuning"
Thanks! yes u/Christopher_Geffen and u/richmond456 had the same good point. I might overlooked that great in-between option. Would love to go for GT4 first. Much respect 🤙🏼
"Just run a ghost race. That way you can try and keep up with race pace without the threat of taking people out. The hotlap times are a good target,  but I'd aim more for the average lap times instead."
way to go ☝🏼 thanks
that’s one great input. thanks! I thought like I literally lost all of my skills with those guys. I’ll keep her offline then for a while
"As for hardest car in the game, try the v8 supercar.  That’s probably the hardest car in the game."
thank you so much! a perfect description of that beast
I can tell you know what you are saying but the car shown in your status
It’s pronounced Por-sche.
It’s pronounced Por-sche.
"The entirety of Reddit prob needs a trigger warning for you then 😂 Redditors have no love for grammar, reality, and personal hygiene."
What’s the difference between Jaguar and Jag then?
"Classes don't reflect skill level at all, they reflect safety rating. Higher skill levels ""should"" represent safer drivers but the reality is anyone can farm a high SR to reach A class 4.99.  Once you have that high of a safety rating you can basically afford to drive like an asshole and take incident points if they feel like it to gain an advantage (like cutting the track to shave lap time though off-tracks).  As long as they can keep it above 2.0 or farm it to there before the season ends they won't lose their current license class."
"Maybe try ghost races, so you can see their line and drive along them without crashing somebody :)"
"Oh no, please don't tell me that! I'll end up buying one, with terrible consequences for my rating and stress levels."
Yeah that doesn't help.  https://www.porsche.com/stories/culture/how-to-pronounce-porsche
or.. just have too much homegrown smoke before formulating a question to the community 😬
three letters
I don’t recommend it. Tough to find races and it’s right hand drive lol.
"Yes, exactly. Look at the video in your link."
"Formulating a question yes. I’d just like questions that are at least coherent, that’s a tough nut to crack."
"I'm the UK, right hand drive is a plus :)"
"sorry I do my best translating stuff from my brain to english, coherency is not my strong part yet. and it’s probably not the last time I type word coherency in comments"
I haven’t found a race yet with enough people to be official.
"Hi there, me and my friend were planning to race for Daytona 24. Would you like to merge. My ir is 1360. B class. We are planning to drive cadillac GTP. Would like to merge our teams?"
"Alright pal, are you based in Europe ?"
No. I am from India and my friend is from USA
okay pal my discord is revrustyy add me on there and ill dm you with more info once we are sorted
Alright then 👍🏽
"always start with a full tank. if you don't you'd have more to refuel which would mean spending more time in pitlane.

yes fuel and tires are at the same time. typically if you have a full stint ahead you can just change since full fuel is shorter than tires"
"Just change tires and fuel every pit stop. Fuel and tires are done at the same time. There isn't a tried or fuel strategy in pits. The only time you would need to not change tires is if it's the last pit stop of the race and you are only taking like 30 liters. At this point taking tires would be slower. 

The only fuel strategy would be saving fuel while on track and maintaining pace by drafting with a partner and lifting before turns. 

Btw. You can test this all out by doing a full fuel run. Will only take about 45 mins. As long as an imsa race.  

Could have read this wrong, but I assumed you were talking about Daytona 24. 

If you are talking about imsa, then it's best to start with full fuel load, then pit during our window. On a track like Daytona, you don't need to change tires for imsa and if you did you would lose time."
"Thanks, that's some good tips there!

Oh, it's neither, I should've mentioned that it's a 100 min. league race, so more like imsa"
"So with this timing you will be able to change tires and fuel the needed to finish the race. If you can do this than definitely change tires. 
100 mins should be 2 full tanks and a splash and dash. So you change tires at first 2  pit stop, then don't change tires at last pitstop. 

I could be wrong about the fuel timing for 100min race. It would be best if you ran 1 full stint then took the average fuel per lap. Then calculate how much you need to finish."
Rain for the D24!!!  (Just kidding)
"I suspect this will be to address the hole in the fence at Daytona that can be exploited. Maybe a last minute pass of the damage model too, since some parts are still breaking way too easily."
"Any news on the service being back ? It's been 3h in the middle of the afternoon for Europe, the only time of the week I could play..."
Hopefully one day they will fix the worsening netcode  🤞
Soon ™️
The one left by Austin Dillion?
">  the hole in the fence at Daytona that can be exploited

come again? lol"
"There is no worsering netcod. All server for Daytona are USA, so people from Europe who mostly race on other series on Europe servers now are on USA. Same is with other people who was on other servers. We all go on USA servers."
"There's a spot in the infield with a fence that has no clipping, so you can drive right through it and skip half the track."
Try being in Australia.  Netcode sux
"the one near west horseshoe? you still get dinged with a black flag for using it.

For those unaware you can take a left near west horseshoe turn 5 and cut through an off road area. it puts you out a little before the bus stop."
network latency has limitations that no netcode can fix. As things go faster things get worst. I used to play a combat flight simulator (Aces High) and planes going at 600mph relative to each other meant that weird things would happen with the packet delays. There is no ways to fix it except better infrastructure.
"Given that if light travelled in a straight line between Boston and Australia (yes, I know Australia is big and it's not a city) it would take around 56ms (given that the distance is about 17000km) just to reach Boston. Double that to get an indication of ping time - again, given a straight line and no time spent on the server side, and you end up with 112ms *just in travel time for the light pulses alone*.

If you add in network equipment, different ISPs, network priority, etc - you're talking around 200-250ms; which is the same delay as you'd have playing over a modem to a local friend back in the old days.

So your *latency* is about the same as playing over a 33.6k modem 25 years ago.

There's only so much magic any networking code can do to predictability when there's a *quarter of a second* in difference between what you do and what you see."
"Infrastructure can't overcome the speed of light distance.  Even if you could drill a straight line through the earth, Boston to Sydney is still 12,000 km."
"iRacing were standing up a west coast server farm, so the distance is really just to LA or Seattle, then to whatever city hosts the west coast servers.

Rest of your post is still valid… can’t get data between two points any faster than c."
"I know.  We are such a small percentage of the player base so it will never change for us.  But ping is shit here and it has been getting worse over the last 2 seasons.  
Just something we have to deal with here."
"In this case we're talking about the Daytona 24 - and all servers available are US-Boston.

Australia - LA / Seattle is about 13000km, so about 43 ms - or 86ms round trip if that was the case."
We need more solo events on the road side.
Here's my special event suggestion: Long Beach Grand Prix. A special event modeled on IndyCar's second most prestigious race would be a great way to celebrate the official reunion of the two!
The base content mini enduro is a great idea. 
As long as it's not yet another gtp/lmp2/gt3 event I will root for it
"I appreciate the ideas for Macau and Adelaide, barring the tiny issue that Macau and Adelaide aren't in the sim.
Adelaide would be very cool all around. I like the Macau GP and know for a fact it would be terrible to race online.

Total yes on the free enduro idea. There are enough base cars & tracks to make a decent official enduro."
Copper World Classic 🙏 Please & Thank You
NASCAR A B C & ARCA at the Daytona RC
"As someone who absolutely loves street tracks (especially Long Beach), I'd love the Macau GP.

And to be honest, if iRacing ever gets the rights to the Macau race track, we would absolutely have the GT3, F3 and TCR races as special events."
Race of 1000 years would be lit
"Yeah, how to write an article without saying anything. 1 pretty okay (Le Mans), 1 for base content (fair enough), 2 tracks that don't exist. And the best idea ever: a special event with any car on any track!

And we have more then enough special events for road cars. Maybe some lesser used cars on wacky configurations would be fun. But I would focus on open wheel stuff, for instance.

Lotus 49 @ Monza. Clark had a great race there in 1967. He died in April, why not have a ""Jim Clark remembrance"" race every year, visiting a different track. 

McLaren MP4-30 @ Brazil. Special deck chair for the winner.

Masters of Formula 3 @ old Zandvoort. Seen as the best / premier F3 event until 2016 when the event was held a last time."
"It would be fun to have a multiclass open wheel series outside of week 13. Gimme Skippy, F4, F3, Indy, and SF23 on the same grid"
Rally!!!!
Fully agreed.
"I'm surprised they didn't already have that. A special event for oval IndyCar racing and one for road/street IndyCar racing.

I'd be all for that!"
The old Indycar iRacing Series is being rebranded as the Indycar Tour and moving to full length races so we pretty much already are getting the Long Beach Grand Prix
Yeah it's a great idea but I'd have it on Rudskogen rather than Charlotte Roval.
"There is one in there, which I would take over the 6 hours of Indy anyday. But the rest are not those three classes"
"What cars would you want to use? 
For me It would be to throw in the HPD, GT1, GTE, old GTP nissan, maybe the Chevy Daytona DP."
Yessss
I'm all for this idea.
So I guess your suggestions would also be just not saying anything either then? Damn why bother making anything at all?
"Right? I'm stoked for the Indy 500 but I think there should also be a full-distance IndyCar road/street course event, and Long Beach makes the most sense."
Yo what?? Did not know that!
"I know, it was just a blanket statement. All the ideas that aren't that look great imo"
"Not sure honestly, op had some good ideas. I'd like to see something similar to champ car, like the production car challenge. Big endurance races with club cars. Maybe mx-5, mustang, tcr, and radical just to throw some cars out there. Or just do the PCC endurance like people have been asking for."
"At least I'm giving some realistic/feasible examples instead of ""Lets do races on tracks that do not exist on iRacing!"" or ""Do you want to know my idea of a Special Event? It's really easy. Look at all the cars available in iRacing and pick one. Now look at all the available tracks in iRacing and pick one. You now have your Special Event!"""
Then you'll love the Indycar Tour. It's going to be a full season if full length Indycar races (minus the Indy 500)

"But by your own logic, it's still apparently nothing if you're judging the content of the article that way."
"It's clipping, turn it down"
"There is auto FFB feature that will decrease the FFB strength to maintain an acceptable amount of clipping.  It will be less than what you are used to so keep that in mind.  Clipping is bad since you max out the torque output of the DD motor which can overheat if you continuously reach that maximum over a long period of time.  Turn it down with the auto FFB feature and maybe play around with the slider to have a nice balance between road detail on the infield part vs the oval banking.

P.S. Drive like 2-3 laps before you adjust the FFB setting.  Also the FFB limit is track specific, so whatever works for Daytona may be too weak or too strong for a different track FYI."
the force feedback in iracing? and thanks :)
"Maybe I will just assign specific buttons for it on my wheel. In fixed class I don’t use almost any of them anyway. 

the auto feature is in settings of iracing yes?"
"Press F and you can see a bar that represents the FFB - if it turns yellow its getting close to clipping, if it turns red - say goodbye to any detail at all!

  
A bit of clipping is okay over big bumps etc, but generally you want to keep it in the green with occasional dips into the yellow. Press F9 in game to adjust the FFB whilst out on track. Also, this particular black box will have an 'auto' button after you've done several laps. iRacing will do its best to keep you right on the limit, short of clipping, if you press that."
It will be in the Main menu of your session in FFB settings but you can access it through your black box on the fly while you drive too.
aaa in black bix again! they put everything there. ok awsome
"Great league with clean racing! I highly recommend it if you are new and looking to develop your driving skills. We run a post-race incident review for most races, helping new (and veteran!) drivers improve their racecraft."

If the car can be brought to the pits safely then they have the right to get it there without a tow. If the car can barely be under control then it should be towed.
"I'm sure it's mentioned somewhere but I'm almost positive it treats it as if the truck leaves the pits and drives the track to you. So if you crash after the pit entrance, the truck has to do another lap. Basically add 2 slow laps and that's your tow timer.

If you crash after the pit exit, the truck can exit pits, get you, and come back in only 1 slow lap."
In my experience it's almost always faster to drive back unless you can't keep control of the car.
"6.9.6. A driver may call for a tow to the pits at any point during a race by pressing the Enter/Exit/Tow Car control (also known 
as “Reset”), which will move the driver forward around the track to his or her pit stall, where they will be held for some 
amount of time that represents a tow vehicle returning the driver’s car to the pits. The time the tow takes is based on 
how far forward around the track the driver’s car is being towed, so that the driver is neither gaining nor losing track 
position to the other competitors, plus a base penalty time for calling for a tow. If the tow takes a driver across the start/
finish line to his/her pit stall, the driver will be scored for that lap after the tow completes. Once the tow is complete, the 
driver’s pit crew may complete any requested pit work and attempt to repair the car, and any pending penalties will be 
served.
6.9.7. The duration of a tow is based on minimizing advantage gained or lost relative to other competitors on track regardless 
of where on the track a tow is called for. To this end, the duration of the tow is longer while a full course caution is in effect 
and competitors on track are travelling at pacing speeds, than during green flag racing when competitors are at full 
racing speed. Any tow in progress will lengthen or shorten the remaining time appropriately if a full course caution begins 
or ends while still towing."
"I don’t believe 6.9.7.
If you do a pit lane start for industry ring, you will be passing the pits on the first lap as everyone who towed from the first corner incident comes out. The total tow time there is like 15 seconds longer than a normal lap, not caution speed."
Read it again. The tow will only be at caution speed if there is a full course yellow.
"There was an issue discovered during maintenance. Alex G posted an update in the forum thread.

Not looking forward to 3am in the 24 after this patch...
"Common it's been 3h already, the only afternoon I could play.

Can't they do those hotfixes during the least played hours ?"
"Lol so much down vote, for a service we pay top dollar for they could absolutely do those hotfixes during night hours for them. Also there is absolutely leat played hours during pacific night time for example.

This is standard maintenance procedure for top dollar companies when doing those kind of hotfixes"
what a joke. how does patching up a minor map exploit shut the entire service down for 5+ hours? if anything put the daytona sessions and hold and keep everything else running.
"Daytona 24 after 21 hours of racing. 

Crewchief: ""It seems to start raining"""
"Yeah right bro, went off at 1 longggg"
They do them during their work hours. Can't please everyone and no point of them working overnight just to piss off someone else.
"It's a worldwide game. There's almost never going to be a ""least played"" time. As half the world logs off, the other half begins logging on.

 Someone will be upset and someone will be inconvenienced, that's the nature of maintenance."
"Sure but during what regions night time?

What makes your money more important than anyone else?"
It's always night somewhere and starting downtime around workday start like they seem to do makes sense
So american.  Me me me
"So what time do you suggest then? Conveniently one that doesn't affect you I'm guessing. 

Doesn't matter when they do it, someone is gonna bitch and moan about it. Bunch of crybabies."
"Yeah I don't understand all the downvotes, there's a least played time for EVERY game and it's very common practice to do exactly what you said. 

I personally don't know the play time rates, but I'm positive 0800-1300 EST is not the least played time."
"Look at a globe. Night hours for them is primetime for the other half of the world.

You can survive without sim racing while they do necessary maintenance. You'll live."
"Completely agree. Ridiculous. On the subject of being short changed, paying top dollar for service which can’t detect who initiates contact first and as a result punish everyone. Even EA can do that ffs and they’re useless…"
No idea mate - can only assume some catastrophic has happened 😂 can’t lie tweaky like a nitty to get racing
I know they've explicitly said they wont do it. But I will still be disappointed if it doesn't rain at 3am
"How would it not be the least played time? Most of the US would be at their job (on average), and it would be lunch to the end of the workday (again, on average) in most of Europe."
[deleted]
Well sounds like iracing might not be for you then you are free to play those games that are so much better
"Maybe you're right, like I said I personally don't know the time rates, but I'm sure it would be easy to find out. I always see the least about of players are around 0300 EST for me. It sits around 4000 players at that time"
"It really makes no difference. Point is, someone somewhere is going to be affected.

To bring in staff overnight, pay them overtime, just to have people *still* whine about it would be a waste of time and resources.

Edit: And on that note, do you really believe that the US has more racers than Canada, all of South America, the entirety of Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as Australia and OCE? America ain't the only place with internet and sim wheels my friend."
Bore off lad you’re allowed an opinion 😂 bet you used to remind the teacher when homework was due

I feel you there man 😂
"As I understand it, if the protest was upheld that's the only response you'll ever get. It just means you don't get or need to know the details, but be assured that some action was taken."
"I got protested when I was in D class for blocking. I was trying to get out of a faster drivers way and instead of holding my line I moved over. Then he moved over and I moved back. We did this until he re-ended me. I apologized but he still felt the need to protest me. Fine. I received an email from iRacing notifying me of the infraction. I replied that if they looked at the session they could see I was giving was to faster cars. I received an email that was personally written saying they saw what I was referring to be gave me instructions and tips on what to do in the future. It actually helped me out and I haven’t been successfully protested since, not that there would be a reason to. Point is protesting does help those who need to learn. It’s not always a negative thing."
"Look, there's no cure for stupid... if you're constantly protesting bad driving, you're wasting your time. I save protests for properly outrageous offences, which honestly doesn't happen every race no matter what series you're in. In four years, I can count my protests on both hands."
I follow the people I protest and get a little dopamine when they don't log back in for a week.
"If it’s a racing incident, don’t protest. That’s not what it’s for. Everyone makes mistakes. If it blatant, file away but they’re not for you. It’s all about the consequences of the offender to keep them from doing it again. Doesn’t really matter what iracing tells the person filing, but there is action associated with the protest system"
I may be wrong but IIRC theres a privacy law or some reason they aren't allowed to say what a punishment was.
"That email is the ""you won"" response. The other response is effectively, we didn't find anything wrong/protestable about what they did. 

You're not entitled to know what action iRacing took on a driver.

Most of the time, it will be a warning of some type and some corrective explanation of what to and what not to do.

If it's more egregious, it'll be a suspension.

If it's outrageous or an issue they've dealt with repeatedly from a driver, they will ban them permanently."
What are some typical actions? Sometimes I feel like such a snitch just protesting. At least I want it to mean something
"That's cool, thanks for sharing. In my case, the driver protested ran full speed into me at a hairpin, as a retaliation action after we got into a racing incident. Forza style and all"
"Hope I get this style of response. Got the sim a week ago, got protested today for an “unsafe rejoin” when I can’t recall ever doing that (my race lasted 3 laps and I got involved in a wreck which put me out the race). Hoping they can tell me what it actually was because someone went through the effort of protesting me over something even I can’t remember doing in 3 laps."
"I've been on for 10 years and maybe have 4 or 5 protests I have filed.  Accidents and mistakes happen, it's part of racing.  

Intentional blocking, intentionally wrecking, unsafe entry on to track, racist speech on vox or text, threats, etc are legitimate protests.   Stupidity, for the most part, is not."
"No. It's just always been iRacing's policy which makes sense.  The punishment should be between the offender and ~~god~~ iRacing. The only reason people have a problem with this is that they want to see retribution when they are ""wronged"" but that doesn't benefit anyone. Doesn't undo the accident and only makes people angry/toxic when they see a punishment that doesn't meet their expectations. 

And then that attitude just leads to fewer protests being filed which exasperates rather than improve the problem. "
"Could be a warning, suspension, or even a ban. "
"I've never been on the other end of a successful protest, but from what I've seen and read, anything from a nicely worded email asking them to kindly not do that again, through to suspensions and possibly beyond for repeat offenders and serious offences on chat etc..

You shouldn't feel like a snitch, you're not the one making the decision or dishing out the punishment, if you protest and the stewards don't think it meets the criteria, then nothing will happen and the other person will never know."
"Don't feel like a snitch - legitimate protests are necessary as there is no live stewarding of races.  Without protests iRacing would devolve in to Forza madness.

As for typical actions, it really depends on what the offense was and how serious it is.  Looking at your protest (Retaliation or Intentional Wrecking) if it's just somebody nudging someone off the track and a first offense then a warning will likely be the outcome.  If it's multiple hits causing a massive wreck or a second offense then it's more likely they get a holiday from iRacing for a week or two.  Turning around a driving head first in to traffic while screaming obscenities down the mic may be a more permanent vacation."
"If they have never done it before, a warning.

If they have done it once before, a stern warning.

If they are repeatedly doing it, a suspension.

If they have been repeatedly suspended, a ban.

You will never know but that letter lets you know that they did the appropriate step in that chain."
"Don't feel like a snitch, it's one of the many things that makes the racing in iRacing better than consoles... consequences.

If someone thinks they can clown around and purposely ruin other people's races because they can't control their temper or they just want to be an ass, if they do it here they will lose their privileges.

You don't have to protest every little thing, but if they are purposely wrecking or doing stupid things in the formation lap, protest them.

Do your part to help keep the racing in iRacing clean."
That’s BS. I’ve had to protest for intentional wrecking me. We paid too much money in service and content to deal with that shit.
It was a full speed ram into the car in front after both cars got into a racing incident.
"The other thing I’d add is that they’ll notify you if results are overturned due to your protest. I don’t know if this has always been done, but I received a unique reply the other day stating that a case had already been opened against the person, and that meanwhile the results have been overturned. They even attached the updated pdf of the race results that showed him in last place. I thought that was a cool bit of info. (Multiple people had reported him apparently for pitting on the final lap as a glitch to shorten the lap time by a bit and gain positions)"
"This is a new thing since this season. Iracing has given themselves a couple more methods for punishment, including the postrace disqualification"
"You get to read the sporting code (seriously, read the whole thing).

You get to race for a month and likely, will be humbled. 

You start in rookie series and have to advance your way out by driving safe enough to advance."
"You mean what content? Pretty sure it's detailed when signing up.
What do you mean by process?"
Thanks everyone for the answers🤝
You’ll have enough content to get you through rookies and D class if you don’t want to buy anything more yet.
"Rule 1 = Read the sporting code  
[https://www.iracing.com/iracing-official-sporting-code/](https://www.iracing.com/iracing-official-sporting-code/)

You can race in rookie series. They have a free car and free tracks, so you don't need to buy additional content for that. And you can stay there your whole life if you want. 

For the road category you can race Mazda MX-5, Formula Vee and Formula Ford.  
For the Oval category you have rookie legends and street stock.  
For dirt oval you can do dirt street stocks (and dirt legends, but I think they use paid tracks. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong).  
For the dirt Road category you can do Rookie Rallycross and Rookie Pro 2 Lite Dirt trucks. 

Next rule. Don't forget to read the sporting code.   


And you don't need to do something to race. You just need to sign up for the race and be ready at the time the race start.   


Never wreck someone intentionnaly because ou will get punished for that.   


Last rule: Repeat rule 1."
Run over a lot in Rookies
Frustrated at being wrecked by other new members. /sarcasm. Kind of.
"Car cost is like $11.95 track cost is $14.95. If you buy 3 things at once you get a discount. 

After rookies you will probably want to try paid content so choose tracks based on the season and car you really want"
I’ve heard that the steam version is less worth it than just going through iracing website
1 month of play
"I'm not afraid of getting humbled, rather of getting rammed

Thanks for the info"
"Yes, will I be able to race with the content, and what is the content.
Process - what are next steps before I can run with others online"
Thank you!
"Maybe my experience isnt normal, but i think ive only been ""rammed"" 1 time. Be respectful, remember everyone makes mistakes, and dont try to wim on lap 1 and you should have a decent time."
"Good. Take that fear of getting rammed and turn it into a skill. Ignore those who blame it all on you, but always question whether you are at fault. Drivers be crazy out there. Any questions?"
"You literally go to iracing.com, scroll down and find all the ""free"" cars and tracks included. Then when you join, you will have to unlock series by progressing through the licences, so at the beginning the will only be ""rookie"" series, but you are allowed to run them online straightaway"
thanks!
"Blue car is obviously at fault but it was risky taking the outside there. I think what I would have done is feint to the outside and then take the inside as he moves over. Slow down a bit to overlap his rear wheels with your fronts, and aim to place yourself inconveniently at the apex.

That way he's more likely to take himself out if he doesn't give you the space. You risk some damage and losing time, but he will spin himself out. If you take the apex it will force him to an awkward line and you can aim for a better exit."
"The original incident I see as a racing incident. I'd like to see the steering angle of the blue car to see if he intentionally tried to squeeze you out or if he just drifted over to much. If he gives a quick jab of the wheel left to scare you I'd say his fault.

The retaliation should be reported.

As for the overtake on the outside, I see that as being perfectly fine. I wouldnt have backed out but as the car on the outside you're trusting the blue car will slow down enough for the corner and not cook his brakes on entry and slaughter you through the bus stop anyways."
Definitely report the retaliation.  Things like this need to be weeded out.
You did nothing wrong here. The initial contact was nothing more than a racing incident for me IMO. But that retaliation was bullshit.
"Blue kills Red. He made his one allowed maneuver to the inside, and then decides to go outside and ram Red."
"That is absolutely what I should have done, easier said than done obviously but yeah next time in this situation I'll try to change my line"
Fake the left and take the inside. Works every time
it wont crash. you will just have bad FPS.
"Your CPU and GPU are on the limit, consider lowering your settings for some more headroom."
"Are you going with triples? If you are with Nvidia GPU, turn SMP on in Graphics/Monitors.
I would suggest to have at least 60 fps for a smooth experience. If you have freesync enabled, you can have a smooth frames per second from 48 fps . Below this, you can notice the game is slower.

The problem is if you are bouncing from 140 fps to 60, then 90, then 40, then 120… and so on.

For a better experience you should try to get a steady fps if possible. I know this is difficult with night  tracks like Daytona and +40 cars, but here there is a couple of things you could try to improve the performance:

Sky off
Cars detail off
Grandstand off
Crowd off
Event Detail off
Objects low 

Cars visible 30 (8)
Draw min pits 

Very important:
LOD: 
cars - min only 
Track - min only 

And;
Turn off objects self shadowing
turn off dynamic objects 
Turn off distortion
Turn off HDR

Iracing is very CPU demanding, so this settings could help you to decrease the  CPU load."
"I started a thread asking what is the highest FPS people have seen in iRacing, and I just got slammed over and over again that high framerate is ONLY needed for FPS games, and anything above 120hz is going to be ""worse"" because of smearing.     
Guess they would love your 63."
"Hey man! First of all thanks a million for the detailed response to my post, very much appreciated.

Yes, I am using triples and I appreciate the fact that I am asking a lot from my equipment. I am kind of surprised though because, although it is not top of the line, my hardware benchmarks really well when I run diagnostics (see attached specs).

I have lost about 200ir because of crashes in the last couple weeks, but with some tweeking of my settings I have established reasonable stability. 

I thought I had it nailed until I pulled up these bars and was surprised to see that I am still maxing out my rig.

I have the LOD settings set to what you have recommended and have set a frame rate limit to 70 FPS. I was sitting in the pits for this screen shot but when I get onto the infield and I am more or less pinned at 70.

I'll bring the limit down to 60 and enable the free sync function and see if I can get some more headroom that way.

Would you be able to comment on my rig's specs? I think I may upgrade the CPU or find a betting cooling solution. Would it be worth it?

Thanks again for the detailed response!

Always need dynamic track data rendered - especially on dirt
"Lol you still sour about that?  It was a ridiculous post and your responses to legitimate statements were just pure ignorant.  I didn't even participate, just read and laughed."
I strictly race IMSA and sportscar endurance events.
"It was last night - not exactly months ago.         
What is so ridiculous about asking what the highest rates are and if there is any kind of limit?      
Turns out among all the hate and mansplaining that the answer is the physics runs at 360hz, so beyond that will not show useful information."
My apologies. Hopefully the new track/tire models aren't that impacted for you then if you need them off
Mansplaining…..GTFOH.

"It's moreso about being able to see and use the track information that everyone else can see and adapt to. With the new models, lines are supposed to require more adaptive approaches than one reliable groove (if that makes sense) so if you can't read the track you might be at a huge disadvantage.

"""Is this like golf where the lowest score wins?"" - OP probably"
"Ahhhh, gotcha. Good point."
"I just drove the old Ferrari and the 296 because of the fixes series
They are easy to drive and you can archieve good rotation mid corner.

Since i'm A class i think about switching to the AMG but everything i expect, in terms of car behavior ,comes  from my experience in acc.

So maybe more Top speed, more exit speed, less rotation and stable over curbs"
"To me, no matter what I do, I always end up being faster with the BMW. Somehow I think my driving style matches that bath tub so I'm always 0.5-1s slower on everything else 😅

As for something that drives like the Audi, did you try the Lambo? Maybe they are somehow similar"
"Not quite what you are looking for but in our league we once tested to see which was the toughest GT3 so you could pick on survivability. A few of the cars have been replaced now obviously but it's a fun 10 minutes. 

https://youtu.be/QYhOsjmK0MQ"
The Ford GT2/3 sounds wicked and when you lose in GT3 with it you can blame it on its age and not your skillz
The new Audi is still an r8…just the second evolution. New Audi is good. Can always anticipate the new car being the best because that’s a good way for them to get people to buy them.
"In my experience:

The front engine cars have the worst traction but that means you can drive them really aggressively from the apex to exit and get a lot of rotation there if needed. 

The mid-engine cars have slightly better balance on entry.

The 992 you can hammer the brakes and is super stable on curbs."
"Drive them all during the next downtime, everyones opinion will differ and it really just depends what you enjoy.  
I like FR and noise so went with the Merc.."
"The Audi is the most balanced and predictable imo and can be fast on any type of track. The Ferrari plows like a dump truck (rear end locked in, less stearing) which is why it tends to be more stable and popular, and those who love the pony tend to hate the Audi."
"Mid engined ones are generally less forgiving, the BMW is the easiest, front engined ones are easier overall but can be more lively on exit. The 911 is a very different kind of car, rear engine means it's super unforgiving, and you'll need trailbraking more than in the others due to the weight imbalance. It's very much my kind of car, but it's unique in it's character and many don't get along with it at all"
"This was take less time for me than creating post for you.

https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=iRacing+GT3+comparison+S1+2024+video&l=1

You are welcome."
Prefer the BMW myself over the Ferrari
The new Audi is almost exactly like the old one.
"I'm thinking of going Porsche or Audi, front engined cars are typically frustrating as hell to drive for me."
"100% this here. I started off in the Porch as I saw all the cars were running equal times and I wanted to like it. I don't get along with it. I got the BMW and instantly was feeling good. I'm still slow, but I'm like 1s faster than the Porch, consistently, even when the Porch is supposed to be. Then I test drove the Lambo, LOVED how it sounded and felt, and since everyone else was faster in it, I impulse bought it. I'm consistently 1s slower than the BMW haha.

So M4 GT3 bath tub fo lyfe

edit: someone else mentioned that the FR cars can be driven harder from the apex out and will rotate. I think that fits my style, as I'm just not good at trail braking. All my real life race cars rotated plenty, so I never really needed to trail brake. All about getting the thing woahed down and back on the gas fast. That's how the M4 drives. Where the Porch and Lambo need a lot of trail braking to rotate. Next test drive, I want to try the Merc. I'm consistently faster in it, and I like how the GT4 AMG feels over the GT4 M4, so maybe it's the same in GT3 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
Yeah this video was useless for picking a car but it was great for a laugh. Thanks for sharing
"Problem is that it is very oversteery, way more than the old one."
"Isn't that like 6 weeks away? 

Like I said in the OP, I loved the Audi R8 LMS when that was current so I like a pointy front end and despise oversteer :p"
I bought the Pony and hate it. I might need to buy the audi anyway..
RSR used to be my 2nd favorite GTE just behind the Ford and afaik RSR is rear engine as well
"Thanks man, that gives me the exactly the things that I've already found and don't care about: Series results and ""Which is the fastest GT3"" videos and posts. I don't care about results and which is the fastest, I want to know what it feels to drive each one."
🏴
"What’s the gearing like in the BMW? I hate it in the GT4, though the car is pretty nice otherwise."
"I just can't get the Porsche to work for me, I just lose the rear end far too often. I'm pretty comfortable in mid engined so I think I might just be throwing it into corners too quick and not controlling the rear engine well enough."
"Glad you enjoyed it. Good luck in your search. I really struggled with the old Ferrari. Last time I tried GT3, I found the Lamborghini to be more suited to me. That's coming from a single seater background. 

You hear good things about all the cars though depending on who you ask."
Is it? I’ve been driving the fixed setup around Charlotte and it feels kinda understeery. Especially out of the chicane. Am I missing something?
"Each of the patch deployments has put the test server up for 24h, been 3 so far this season so won't be too long :)  
I live for oversteer and rarely drive downforce stuff because of that. Fr500 mustang is bae, H gate, no assists and a drift weapon."
"Servers are down right now, 24 hours to test from now, have fun :D"
"The RSR is actually mid-engined, but it is still closer to the 911 GT3 than any other GT. If you've raced the porsche cup and got along with it well, the 911 GT3 will suit you just fine, they're very similar, bar the aids and aero. As others have suggested, downtime is your friend. No idea about your financial situation, but I'd get any one of them, drive it a while until the next update, then try the others and buy whichever you liked more"
"Main idea is, is you try Google before asking?
No offense."
BMW GT4 is an absolute boat.  Feels like driving a Lincoln Town Car lol.
"The GT4 and GT3 are nothing alike. They’re even different generations of production car as well as different spec race cars. I despise the bus that is the GT4. Car just refuses to turn. But the GT3 is a beauty. I personally think it’s the most user-friendly of all the GT3s and that doesn’t mean it’s slow, cause it’s not "
"I like it, there’s only a few tracks where you actually hit 6th gear. It’s got a lot of pull in 4th and 5th. Understeers a tad when fixed, but I love it."
"The BMW GT3 gearing feels sluggish tbh. At least ferrari can adjust the gearing. BMW cannot from what I've seen.

The GT4 is terrible tbh"
I drive the GT3 Beamer. The gearing in the baseline setup is really long. The fixed setup at least at Charlotte this week is much better. I can’t do Daytona 24 this year so I can’t speak to that.
"> You hear good things about all the cars though depending on who you ask.

Yeah that's why I asked for characteristics, since those are more objective than anything. I bought the Ferrari but kind of regret it, lol."
"Mostly with less than 100% wing, as i dont race fixed, but i just raced it at Spa... the old one felt less dangerous to do that, but if you can tame the new one, boy, it is fast!"
"I have done 5-6 seasons in a fixed gt3 league and the merc is way more oversteery imo and has been my favorite. I usually test all the cars, albeit only 5-6 laps each. The Audi has been extremely stable and fast since its launch, with just a very hot Sebring showing some issues. But at the end of the day the others car are still equally as competitive. BMW is almost always a safe bet."
Is there a way to know when these sessions happen where you’re able to test drive any car?
Yo thank you for the heads up!!
Financial is fine but I'd rather not spend if I can help it lol. I bought the Ferrari and drives like a dog so I'll wait until downtime lol
"You just proved that you couldn’t find the answer via google? And you’re doubling down? 

Pass the dutchie my way bruh"
"No offense, but did you even read my text post? 

> I cant really find a video or text post debating this."
"Yeah the GT4 is like a boat. 🤣

I've raced worse though. 87s on a road course is horrible"
"That makes a lot of sense. The fixed setup runs 7 wing, so that might be where I’m also losing my top speed on the oval portion lol."
"If you get the iRacing app and allow notifications, it tells you when Test Drive is live"
Whenever the servers are down
"I take you've not gotten setups for the 296, then? From my limited experience with it in ringmeister, the iracing setups are pushy trash, there's many good sets on garage61 I've found, but it is naturally a very safe feeling car, but worth experimenting. I'm with you with not throwing money out the window but, it's iracing, we do that anyway, might aswell IMO.
If you only do fixed series, the ferrari really isn't a good choice, sadly"
"I've only done fixed Ferrari. As I said, I've not raced since 2021 (at all, I literally re-greased my pedals and cleaned my steering wheel this weekend) so I was just jumping into a fixed series to get used to driving"
"I got you - well, take your time getting up to speed and work up to the higher license GT3 races. Maybe IMSA if you're into that. Find some setups for the fezzer, it'll be much nicer"
Must be the last lap or something
"I bet those guys were both saying to themselves, “he wouldn’t dare…right…righhht…oh shiiiit”

Best part is you took them both out and got out of it clean lol in the future, don’t do that plz, but still hilarious"
"Yea running into the back of two other cars is generally your fault. 

It’s cool tho. That’s why rookies exist. Learn racecraft. Get better. "
Yes. You went for a gap that wasn’t even there and it was way too aggressive of a move anyway.
"It’s a very ambitious move for rookies, but technically you did nothing wrong. There was a gap and then it closed after you had established your car in it. I would hold off on similar moves until you can trust yourself and those around you more (ie in a higher license class)."
"This is hilarious actually 😂. I feel your move was kinda like sticking your foot out for the guy to trip over and he did the rest. I'm sure the spotter called 3 wide but you also left zero room for error which is a decision you are allowed to make on a hot race track although may not make you many friends. 

 Edit: realized this was a race start and wasn't paused at the start 🤣 you got a great start on them. I would be upset but I think you are good."
"So this is one of those to win you have to finish situations.  Yes you’re technically in the right here, but you were lucky to not get wiped with that and it’s stupid early to try it.  It’s cool to see and near end of race go for it, but this is the difference between being right and being smart."
"Rookie miata drivers will be mad about this, but those two should have made space once you got in between them. Not that you should ever try this again. lol"
"Nothing. Just a race incident.

Jokes aside, i wouldn't do it, the gap is way too small to be able to pass it safely."
[removed]
"This is a proper ""if gap then car"" moment. But like everyone has said, that's what rookies is for."
"Lots of people here blaming you since you caused the 3-wide scenario, but the other two had no self-preservation instincts or reactions to mitigate the danger of the situation either. They both had room to their sides, you were already in-between, they maintained the squeeze for no reason and paid the price. No need to feel sorry.

Racing incident imo, someone else might had jumped out of your way to preserve their SR and finish the race, others like them will stand their ground and risk it all rather than let you pass. This is the reality of racing with people instead of AI. Win some lose some.

Don't feel discouraged from trying opportunistic moves when presented.  You'll eventually learn which ones have a high rate of success and which ones don't, but you have to try them first to know which is which."
"Yes and no.

No, because technically you dont touch anyone and after making it 3 wide the other 2 could have avoided the crash by making more room instead of closing it.

Yes, because its just bad racecraft. The risk that something is going horribly wrong is very high. So next time have more patience."
Personally I wouldn’t have went for a gap that tiny but imo It’s not really your fault because you didn’t touch either of them and the guy on the left turn into you for no reason. But again going for a gap that tiny is not the best idea because most driver in rookie are going to crash into you like he did to you.
"If you think your move has a good chance of being dangerous it's always best to wait for another opportunity.

If you keep pressure on safely people to tend to make mistakes of you put safe pressure on them."
Meanwhile 4th place just watching....THIS IS MY MOMENT
"100% you lol. I don’t wanna be rude but, How in the hell do you not know that it is all your fault?"
"At this point, it’s not about fault. Live learn & try something different next time. 

Unless you’re psychotic & just realized that you love ruining races. In that case, keep doing what you’re doing lol"
yourenotwrongyourjustanassholememe.jpg
"You were the core reasoning for the incident unfolding. If you were not there, an accident would not have happened. But the other drivers did not drive with any self preservation instincts. Its a classic case of the old adage ""To finish first, you must first finish.""  & ""Its better to be alive than right"".

They easily could have moved to the outside to give you the space you were obviously going to stick yourself into. They didnt and they paid the consequences of being stubborn.  They wouldnt be wrong to be upset about your move because it was very low percentage, but they should also equally be upset at themselves for not taking any action to remain in the race and not wrecked out."
"Not to sure why people are saying you drove into the back of them or there wasn’t a gap. You were in between them for a few seconds before you guys wrecked, the gap was there. Was it the smartest decision? Definitely not but I wouldn’t put 100% of the blame on you"
"Please educate me in how I am wrong, but with space for both on the outside of the track how is this illegal? It was the start of the race and there was sufficient space in the centre for POV to be getting in., if he wasn't squeezed he would've taken the lead early. The outside car chose to turn into middle car. Again happy to be wrong as I don't want to be doing illegal moves in races myself, not that I have found myself this position before."
"For me the car on the left has also responsability. The move was risky? Yes, you went for a needle gap,but also the front cars didn’t close the door, and the movement that caused the accident was when the left tried to close the door but you were already there.
Move on, lesson learned i guess for both."
"You took a big risk OP, but this is 100% the fault of the driver starting in P2. They turned off their line into you and caused the wreck well after they should have been aware you were on the right. If I was a steward, I wouldn't give them a big penalty, since it was only a small deviation that led to the wreck, but you and the black car starting in P1 didn't do anything wrong, even if both were very aggressive - you for starting the 3 wide, and the black car for squeezing in such a tight situation."
I wouldn’t have done it but I’m also surprised the other two cars didn’t open up after your nose was in the middle. After your nose is in it’s too late to close that gap.
"Not your fault. You have every right to be there, You were alongside for seconds, and both of them knew you were there, yea this is probably the most likely outcome for a rookie lobby, but one of them drifted into you."
I read the title and knew it was your fault
"You were in the middle, screw them both 👍"
Nope. Left cars fault
"Your fault, no. But should you have backed out so everyone could live another day? Yes."
"Yes.  It's the start of the race and sure you got a decent start there still wasn't enough space for you between the two cars.  In the future you will be better off backing out of it, you don't need to go for every single passing opportunity"
Yes you dumb cunt
"There's blame for everyone on this one! 

""In order to finish first, you must first finish"""
"""If you no longer go for a gap that doesn't exist, you are no longer an iRacing rookie driver."" -- Ayrton Senna"
"Astonishing there are people in here who don’t think this was on the op. There was a gap, but barely a cars width. Pushing a car in that close to not one but two cars, with net code being what it is, and hoping both front cars are going to either hold a perfectly straight line, or open up and invite you through, and hoping the netcode gods will be lenient? Madness. Before T1 too. Wait for a safer opportunity, that wasn’t a safe option. "
1000% on you. That’s not a gap lol
[deleted]
I don’t know why people don’t leave space. Could have gone 4 wide if the black car knew what they were doing.
Yes - it’s lap one and that gap doesn’t exist
don't know why everyone says it's your fault. you were driving side by side and you weren't running into them. the left one turned into you.
"👌Great start, gaps there, and you took it with a great chance into turn 1. Textbook getaway from the grid. Unfortunately, the guy on the left didn’t afford you the space you were entitled to"
Verstappen would say that is part of racing.
"The fact that you can look at this and still not know the answer explains a lot about the average iracer.

The key to not wrecking people is understanding that Senna was full of shit. If you go for every gap it ends in tears about 90% of the time."
Yes. This is 100% on you.
Yep your fault cause if you were not there they wouldn’t have wrecked.
Yea. You gave them no room for error. It's important to remember. A race isn't about trying to get first. It's about survival. You need to provide room for error. You had no reason to squeeze yourself in the middle. YATA
"What are you talking about, this can never be his fault? Left one turns in and do not leave a space. In f1 every single driver on the grid would go for that gap. If you are not going for it you’re not a racing driver.."
"Forcing your car where there’s obviously not space for a car and taking out two other cars doing their level best to drive safely is generally your fault. So, yeah."
IMO equal blame to all three. Just silly.
Yes you went for a closing gap that wasn’t very big to begin with
LMFAO!!! absolutely 💯
Where were you going?
"Yes, 100% your fault.  You have zero overlap with any of the 2 cars and stone cold took out the poor guy.  

Some food for thought:  let them battle it out, that usually makes them slower.  If you have the speed to keep up with them and even patiently wait behind them, there are some exciting possibilities for you:

1. They may take each other out, then you passed both.  Easy.

2. One may make a mistake or slow down enough where you can get alongside them and make a pass, then if you’re faster than the other one you will catch them and work on a pass"
"Um, yes. You wrecked everybody right at the start. Ran right in the back of them. I know they say “you can’t win the race in Turn 1” but this actually applies to the short portion of the race that occurs before Turn 1 as well. What was the best case scenario here? You’re start wasn’t so good that you were going to clear them before Turn 1."
Haha what was your own honest answer to this question right before posting this?
Yeah you're a dumbass
"Yeah, your fault. Please don’t do this. But, yeah, I feel you. It’s hard to resist!"
"Your fault. That was not enough space.


And even if you didn't wreck, where were you going? You were going to be on the outside of the hairpin. You definitely weren't coming out of that in P1, and there's a good chance you would have lost P2 as well.


Just stay behind P1 and try to follow them into P2."
Entirely on you
"Pushing 3 wide is always risky. Riskier when it’s turn 1.. long race, why force it. But plenty plenty race this way and risk it all. I back out of so much around drivers like that cause it almost never ends well. That mixed with the amount of over seas people you find yourself in a session with with 266 ping. Just a nightmare situation"
Yikes.
YEAH
"Definitely, and what's worse is they would have gotten a bigger incident rating from it than you, even though you caused it"
Yes there was no room🫣😂
"If this is the last lap fighting for p1, then it might not be your fault. But 100% not a move to do in lap 1."
Absolutely 
1000%
Lol yes
"Yes, definitely your fault."
"Yeah, it is. Going 3 wide off the rip totally a no go. You’re introducing unnecessary risk that ended the race of two other drivers. Not fair.

You live and you learn, thanks for sharing."
😂😂😂
💯
Yes.4k
"100% your fault.  I would have stuck behind p1 or even bump drafted him.  If u r actually quicker than him pass later on when u have a clean exit with no traffic. If u r slower than him stick behind him and learn his lines, brake markers. 

Too many lap 1 heroes in this game taking stupid risks.  If u r fast u will be in front by the end. Limit risky moves.  Leave room for passes and dives. Your irating and safety rating will skyrocket. I have over 1000 Mazda mx5 races. Patience has won me so many races. I let overly aggressive drivers by cause I know chances r they don’t finish the race. Often they wind up taking out others in front of me."
"Yes. And btw: this is no arcade game.

You could've bump drafted the right car and gained  one position in the next righthander."
Why would you do that
Dick move
Yeah this is terrible don’t ever do that again
"1000 percent yes, it oays to be patient"
"The minute I read 'I'm in the middle...'

You put yourself and others at huge risk. Tempting as the gap was, you need to resist the temptation."
"Need telemetry of the driver on the left. To me, it looks like you cleanly got in the gap and then he drifted right"
"Well, when you went for it, the gap was there and you where in the gap. Then it closed. I would say in many cases a three wide crash is nobodys fault. You are in the middle and have nowhere to go. The car on the right sees you and is allowed to squeeze you to the right, but doesn't know the car on the right is there and squeezes you to the left. And vice-versa. It is basically a F1 Singapore 2017 start crash or Hockenheim 2003 start crash where nobody has the fault."
You just put yourself in a position that was more than likely going to end in disaster.
"P1 should have covered off the gap on start, P2 should have asserted themselves and held the racing line, you probably would have been better off drafting into T1 but the gap was there and you took it. It's pretty much your fault there but honestly I've seen more egregious T1 wrecks. Rookie Miata is wild"
Yes!
"I mean it was risky, going three wide will most likely cause an accident especially in a track that's as tight as this, so yeah it may be your fault but at the same time i feel like either cars on the outside could have moved a bit outwards, but you shouldn't expect that in rookies tbh. 70%your fault 30% the 2 cars fault"
"Your reply to another comment that reads

> This was the first race where i got a good jump and might have got a lil excited lmao

Yes sir you definitely did lol I'd say this is your fault only because there was so little room to begin with, you were inviting disaster. There's plenty of race to go even in the shortest MX-5 series. Besides all that, that particular section of track, I'm only going 3 wide if I'm on the right lol live and learn"
"Looks like the white Mazda on the left drifted right and didn't see you in the gap. Don't think it's your fault, you got a decent start, only gap was really through the middle."
Yes
"If I can offer some advice, be less focused on being ahead of other cars and be more focused on having the upper hand. You chose to not lift and try to get ahead, but even if that had worked you would have been in a situation at the corner where you would rely on them backing out to not be 3 wide and most likely everyone having a bad time. Reviewing this I think if you'd lifted a tiny bit and dropped in behind the other white car you both could have passed black, or at the least had a good chance to pass in the corner, and then worked out the rest from there."
"Firstly, OP. don't do it again, there was no advantage to going 3 wide there, you were better off in the slipstream to try and make a move into T1.    
    
On the other hand, the other two both knew they 3 wide and opted to give you no space.    
    
Boos all round 😅"
Not your fault. I expect on a dead straight line for people to know where a car is. It’s not rare for 3 cars to be along side eachother. It happens. Op was going for a fun cheeky up the middle play and the other 2 were not paying attention. Use your mirrors
"Uhm. I'd be pissed, rookies or not. Later on you will see that gap in the middle. Especially in oval. Don't do it. This will be the outcome."
That’s the other drivers fault. He failed to maintain his lane and fish tailed himself.
"Yeah, that’s on you."
"""Just because there's a hole doesn't mean you should stick your d**k in it."" - Me.

Definitely on you. You have 10 laps to pass those two, why force it? If you're a faster driver, passing them will happen, and you'll have way more fun in the process.

Maybe you'll have a couple laps side by side and switching positions; you know, racing that keeps the heart beating."
Some days when I browse this sub I find a comment section like this that makes me think Im tripping hard
Yes. Terrible decision before turn 1.
"I can’t play this game anymore. Am I too ugly? Is it my fault? Am I not a good driver? Am I not a good son? Am I too fast? Who will pay for the loss in my IRating? Should I talk to my therapist about this? Why do I need to post so much about others’ behavior? Is this just a game or a simulation? Can I protest twice a day? Does not protesting make me a bad person? Do I seek others’ approval too much? Am I too fat? Too old? What do you think about all of this? Am I too old to play with an automatic transmission? Why are IndyCar and NASCAR so hard to master? Is it just me, or is it the same for others? Why does Automobilista 2 offer more than four cars and a track for less than 20 dollars, while IRacing charges 15 dollars for just one of each? Do I need to pay monthly to be smarter than the rest? Is there any solution? Guys, any advice?"
"Yes, you had nowhere to go. You're all in the same guy, you had nothing to gain but you knew it was risky. Only way it would have worked out is if one of them let out and I hate that ""let off or I wreck you"" mentality"
Lmao is this real?? Cmon man
Sweet pit manoeuvre. 👍👍👍
This is a gap full stop. You race from the get go. Poor driving from the guy on the right caused the incident. The road is straight as well and more than acceptable to be three cars wide and It couldn't be more obvious he was there.
"Definitely their fault in my opinion, and was dumb for them to allow a crash like that on an open straight."
"There was a gap. But think of rookie miatas as toddlers with cars. Don't trust people.  


Would you stick a real car in a gap like that going 100+?? You're trusting them to be inch perfect when they prolly can't even get around the track 5 times with out spinning - you know? Most people can't see what on their inside or outside because of single monitor."
This was the middle car’s fault. There wasn’t space
"Lol....as soon as you said middle it was your fault.   Granted,  i like the aggression and there was a hole.  Ida probably done the same thing but you need a little more space then that if you exist there to be no contract.  Consider the series you're running in before you make a move like that and where you're driving in the field."
[removed]
It’s ambitious but you were absolutely there long enough for the other guys to know you were there and give you space. I wouldn’t recommend taking it three wide that early on a track that narrow anymore though
What was your plan going into turn 1 if you stayed 3 wide?
"In real life this is 100% the right thing to do... they can't turn into you at all ... now if you can't make it past 50% of their car once they are turning in you MUST concede and let them have the turn in... if you can get 50% then they HAVE to give you 75% of your car width on the inside (with a hard barrier it is 100% car width)... This is pretty much how it goes in all NASA / SCCA racing events

now for iRacing.. this is ok BUT you have to deal with Net Code... that could have been the driver at fault trying to squeeze you or it could have just been the system thinking it was you and them colliding... personally I would have followed the car on the right... bumper to bumper... not allowing the car on the left to take the inside... exit of turn 1 you would have been in 2nd with a draft to push up to the outside of turn 4 / 5 where you could take the inside of the hairpin and most likely take first"
"yeah it is your fault, you pushed when there was no space, could they have opened space? yes, should they have? No"
"Uh yeah dude. Unfortunately, most people just don't have enough peripheral view to really be conscious of exactly where you are relative to orher cars, especially ones on your rear quarters. There wasn't really a gap there and you need to be aware of the limitations of iRacing's netcode, which causes collisions that didn't really happen fairly often.

Learning experience though, that's what rookies is for.

Had a full race battle yesterday in Clio Cup and felt bad because I had no clue where the guy behind me was and didn't want to push him too close to the kerbs because they are GIANT at Sonoma. My look left/right buttons decided to map themselves to another feature so I could only look straight forward :("
You’re not at fault but it was a dumb idea.
"Yeah it is, squeezing into a hole that's not really there."
Iracing means gap = send car
I don't understand this sub. He was driving in a straight line and guy on the left pitted himself like op didn't exist... Its not like this is a lunge in a breaking zone...
"I would say that you took the risk, but I don't see anything I would penalize."
"they should have been more aware it was three deep,   plenty of starts look like this with the outside drivers being aware and not pinching the inside driver."
"Yea your fault to many times people try to win the race on the first lap, consistency matters, tire management matters just be patient 

People will take them selves out or others overdriving and a lot are fast first couple laps then wasted their tires, and others may be fast for one lap on fresh tires but aren’t consistent throughout the race 

I personally like to go 90%ish to maintain pace either leader or if I am leading I let the pass and maintain pace tire management first half race and pic up the pace and pick them off 

Patience Is key and have a strategy and observe your prey !"
"Lap 1 

lol"
Yes it's your fault
Im getting singapore 2017 flashbacks
What did you think would happen lol
"No. And here is why. Normally, in these situations someone is driving into a gap that wasn't there. Here, the gap was there, and they just kept driving toward the middle of the track anyway. It is on them. You had a good run and used it. Anyone telling you you're wrong are the kind of people to squeeze someone into a wall and then get mad that they didn't leave you enough room. Once you were there, it was their responsibility not to drive into you. Race start or not.

And to all of you lap 1 capitalists. THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION. 9/10 THAT GAP ISN'T THERE. THIS IS A LUCKY DRIVER AND SITUATION WHERE THE GAP WAS EAS THERE. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD."
"There isn't a ""fault"" per se, but I definitely would not have done what you did, just because it could have ended your race as easily as it ended theirs and even so you only gained one position. If there was a fault, it probably would be on the P2 car since they seem to have initiated contact."
Yes. Obviously.
"They coulda made room probably just werent paying enough attention ..

That being said it was definitely a risky move but there was room for 3 wide.."
Why are they closing? It’s like they’re afraid of being passed and would rather hope he backs down
"100 percent your fault buddy, you should have seen that a contact is highly likely, looks like you ruined other drivers' race, that's my opinion"
That was most definitely not an opening for you brotha 😂
I’ve been an iRacing driver for many years and to be honest with you that was 100% your fault you should’ve slowed down to clear up
"Yep!   


Standard iRacing ""Race ends after T1 incident"""
Yes. That was unnecessarily risky
😅 easy
🤣
This was the first race where i got a good jump and might have got a lil excited lmao
I swear whoever is at fault gets away clean 80% of the time 
"Yeah, it worked but it's not.racing. I'd be pissed if I qualified 1st and had this happen. Lack of respect"
"I want to upvote this. But I can’t.

It’s just…so… nice"
"Literally did not run into the back of the two cars   


"" Yea running into the back of two other cars is generally your fault.  """
"im really confused, i've watched this at 0.5x speed like 20 times now, and the car on the right drifts left and hits him, while the car on the left is drifting right. the fault can't be on the guy in the middle if literally both cars on each side are drifting into him when he's already alongside on a straight? the cars on the left and right had so much room but chose to squeeze"
There was a gap he took it. Both other cars had room but decided to push him. It's on them.
You don't belong here Sir. You're too kind.
"To be fair to OP, left car had plenty of time to react to the light pressure on his quarter panel.

OP initiated contact and shouldn't have, but left car is the one that ultimately fucked up worse. Netcode also makes these light taps a real gamble, so not worth forcing them."
Hover behind the left car since it's going faster. Still funny ASF that neither the front cars pulled just 4 inches away to open up
Meh gap was there both driver closed in on him.
"Idk I’m new man, i figured the spotter called me out for him he just wasn’t able to see me oops"
That last part is important: you need to trust that the other guys will leave you a gap. Specifically in lower leagues you’d be taking a massive risk.
"I agree, but you have to remember the people around you are only human."
"> It’s a very ambitious move for rookies, but technically you did nothing wrong.

Going 3 wide into a gap that is 1.05 car widths directly off the line is in fact doing something wrong."
"They should have indeed, but you are right. OP needs to understand that they almost certainly won't.

Experienced drivers may have recognised what was going on but in rookies, nah. Tempting as it is, staying alive should always be the priority."
Finally someone with sense
"Yeah, I don't feel like the middle car is at fault for the crash. It's a bold move but blame on the middle car? I wouldn't. However middle car should maybe have figured out that the other 2 might be knobs."
100%
I’d hate to see the people mad race legends.

Hell yeah brother

Happens in eurolegends smoothly but that’s real and kinda open wheeled so they’re not as braindead
Weeeeeeeee!
The feeling when you see 3 wide in 4th is amazing. Usually doesn’t end in crash if they are smart and can drive but the fight puts you right back in the slipstream
If this is low percentage than 3 wide around a turn must be close to impossible yet it’s done with ease in slow cars
"No-one is talking about 'legal' or 'illegal', it's about race craft and race management.

To finish first, first you have to finish. There are lots of things in this world that you can do, but really shouldn't, and this is one such situation. This move will end this way more often than not and you are not in control of your own safety. You are relying on not one, but two drivers to keep you safe. Not just two drivers, but two rookie drivers, on cold tyres. It's not worth the risk. In this case the OP emerged unscathed and was a net winner, but so often he will get caught up in the carnage too and wreck his race."
"It's not an illegal move, it's a dumb move."
It IS a gap. But one that's unwise to take 99% of the time; 100% of the time in a rookie lobby
He’s literally beside left hand car from the get go and he spends at least 3 seconds in between them both. There was a gap
That’s definitely a gap lmaooo he’s already beside them…
"Then go try racing in them 😂😂

"There was space to go 3 wide. They were racing fine for multiple seconds. At that point it's on the outside cars to not squeeze. If they don't want him there, it's got to be communicated with car placement beforehand. Not OP's fault"
"The average iRacer is a rookie or has a D class license with 1500 iR (fresh out of rookies).  So yes the average iRacer is an amateur, so what? Look at how bad (and dirty) the average person is on console racers like Forza, GT7, or F1 games to get a reality check."
what's he supposed to do? vanish?
"F1 drivers are not sitting at home on single screen monitors and with dodgy internet connections.

iRacing drivers are not highly skilled professionals with a lifetime of experience behind them.

I agree he's not at fault per se, but he is definitely ill advised in this move as it will end this way more often than not, for the reasons stated above."
"From the looks of it, the white car on the left drifted to the right and essentially wrecked himself by squeezing the POV car."
Please do not call out other users by posting their names or posting videos or images with their name visible
"Just a reminder if you’re unaware and not saying it was intentional

But if they protest good results can be removed from you, so taking out 1 and 2 doesn’t result in everyone just pitting them"
The only thing you should focus on is not crashing and not going off track. Don’t chase irating chase safety rating
"Next time, put your bumper on the inside car's bumper and PUSH!  You'd at least get second and squeeze that outside car out to third. This sort of tactic is why Tin Tops are more fun than open wheelers 😂."
For context to those seeing this reply now…it had 69 likes. Someone ruined it. Children…🤦‍♂️
It's because he put himself between two cars. Never willingly do that. Ever. Because you can see what can and will happen 90% of the time.
"Irl you'd never try to put yourself in that situation due to the high risk of an accident. That's why the rules are written the way they are. Normally people wouldn't even attempt this in real life, but because it's a game people done have to worry about losing money or injuring themself. It's your responsibility as much as everyone else to prevent accidents. If you wanna race like that you can just play literally any other racing game"
"There was zero gap when they put their car in it. You can't rely on other cars to give you space in situations like this.

I'm surprised this took so long to turn into a crash to be honest."
There was never enough room for him. Besides the general badness of going 3 wide in a rookie series off the start - there was literally never enough room for his car to fit between the other two with \*any\* degree of drift from any of the 3 cars. He created the dangerous situation by forcing something that wasn't there.
In ideal world yes. It we talking online racing where people are not so savvy and net code plays own role as well. As a common sense it’s not really wise to get yourself in that position.
"Guy is forcing a gap that doesn't exist, on lap 1. 

It's his fault.  Other drivers are allowed to hold their lines, you have to deal with that."
"Go pause the video at 0:07 seconds. Tell me that's a ""gap"". Okay."
are we going to ignore the fact that the race started 5 seconds beforehand? why would you attempt to get into a gap like that before even the first t1?
"Have to keep in mind that assuming someone is getting a call/warning about you right at the start like that can end up bad (luckily not you this time). I believe that the spotter by default is delayed for a few seconds until you cross/shortly after the finish line (May be wrong here so don't quote me but I recall there being some form of delay in the default api). So they could have gotten the call really late or not heard it at all, but on another hand, it was quite the agressive move on you're part.

 Ideally i'd look to have backed out or tried to follow in behind one right along its bumper to the corner. Lessons learned for next time."
"Dude below says it, but to be specific, spotter is quiet for the first 20 secs of a race. That can be changed to be less time but it’s not reliable. 

Also don’t assume everyone has the spotter off, I’ve had people say they turn it off because it’s annoying."
It’s all good man. Everyone makes mistakes especially early on in their iracing experience. I’d imagine this race was in the rookie Miata series. Just learn from it and try to focus on staying clean rather than be overly aggressive. You got this 👍
"He's under exactly zero obligation to move for you. You shoved yourself into a gap you didn't fit in. I wouldn't bother in rookies, but this is protestable as intentional wrecking imo."
"Yeah, that’s why I threw in that last sentence. It’s never wise to take it 3 wide in rookies"
"Its a boneheaded move but it's not actually illegal, is it? Green flag, gap bigger than the car (even if only by 5%)...unless there's a minimum gap size or a delayed overtake rule that I'm not aware of this is *technically* all above board."
Not inherently. Experienced Mazda drivers should have no problem with this move given the slow nature of the car
For real. iRedditors are a bunch of pacifists. This is a race and if you leave a gap to go 3 wide for multiple seconds then try to squeeze and pay the price.. that's on you. 
Is not fair
"Thanks mate, I appreciate your response."
"if the gap is the exact same width of the car to the millimeter, its not really a gap.  A true gap should have a margin for error. I like to say that 1.5 car widths is the minimum for a clear gap to attempt an overtake. If you are scraping paint to fit into a space, its not a realistic space. This is doubly true online because you also have to account for netcode latency and the differences in what you see and what the server sees."
"This is how it felt in real time, I’m not like trying to defend anything. I’m so new just trying to figure it out so it doesn’t happen"
"And your response says even more about iracers. 

But to answer your question, yes I've been new at things. And when I'm new and it's plainly obvious that I messed something up I don't then post on Reddit asking whether I messed something up."
This is sarcasm right?
Amateur doesn't necessarily mean you have no common sense.
Well the only way to learn is by failing. Fail fast learn fast. The person on the left/right side will look in his/hers mirrors alot more after this incident.
"No one is getting ""results removed"", the OP got away Scott-free, and so does everyone else that does this.. ""Successful"" protests don't result in a change of IR of SR for anyone.."
"IMO, this just breeds iRacers who don't know how to drive around other cars. I didn't improve until I started caring slightly more about iRating than safety rating. As someone who took advice like yours and got a C license early, I don't understand the point of getting higher licenses if you can't compete in those races."
Please don't do that in Rookies. If the person isn't expecting it you'll end up spinning them out of your way. Bump drafting is a skill that needs to be learned and practiced AFTER rookies.
Thanks for the tip! I’ll try to keep that in mind!
Laughing at 69 and then calling others children is peak projection.
Are you guys 12?
"I agree generally with what you're saying. It was not the smartest move, but that doesn't mean he can't be there and is at fault"
"You can rely on other cars to close a space like this that looks open. The lead cars want you on the outside (of them). It gives them more options. On the outside, you end up on the wrong side at some point. Especially with the Mx5 which essentially has no acceleration. And as I am sure many have, and will say. It is your responsibility to pass cleanly. They can not see you. They are not staring at their mirrors, they are working against each other (the cars in front)."
"If there was “zero gap when they put their car in it” they wouldn’t have “been in it”. There was most definitely a gap. I for one, would not have stuck my nose into it, but there was indeed a gap"
"It's important to remember that many of the people who post on this sub are oval racers, and many have 3-digit iRating."
What does that matter he clearly established himself in between both of them for more than 3 seconds as matter of fact he’s on the guy in the left immediately
"He doesn’t have to move for him. But I do feel like the guy on the left turned into him. There’s no reason that he should’ve been turning right really. It’s a right turn ahead, so you should get to the left and prepare to use all of the track. But instead he was veering right for some reason. That was a very small gap, but he fit in it."
Just because something isn't against the rules doesn't mean it's not wrong.
Max Verstappen would agree
"But the exact same can be said about trying to force a gap that's not actually there, especially in rookies."
"You have to balance your desire to race hard against basic common sense. There was technically a gap, but it was extremely small when you consider the following:

There is often a small difference between what you see happening vs what the server sees happening due to internet speeds and distance from the servers, often referred to as net code. Sometimes, you can be within a cm of someone and there's no issues, other times, you bounce off air a foot from another car.

More importantly though, you're in lap one, not even turn one, with cold breaks and tires, and probably some level of increased adrenaline, in a rookies race, with people who are on any number of possible setups, ranging from triples to VR to a 15 inch laptop monitor running at 30 fps that are quite probably also high or drunk. Making a move that aggressive that requires perfect driving on the parts of 3 drivers with that in mind seems like a bad idea."
"Nope, are you scared of racing? We can both agree they were 3 wide without collision, right? Now tell me how the middle car can change the outcome here other than backing out. Meanwhile the outside cars are the deciding factor if they make it to T1 or not. 


Edit: Awe don't block me for not agreeing with your bad take. Coward. "
"I have been told by multiple people in the sub that if someone is intentionally wrecking people to win their result will be altered

Edit: I just checked a protest I did of someone who did this and they now show disqualified

Not sure if that is the reason or something else"
IR and SR will never change but results can now be changed to DQ as of this season on a successful protest. All outlined in the release notes.
This recently changed.  Yes they can remove results.  Not sure about irating or SR but results can be removed
Don't do that. Bump drafting in road races will probably just ruin someone's race and get you reported.
Projection? More like erection.
"Physically, no. Mentally, yes."
"That's why I said 90%. 10% of the time you can be the superhero you think you are. And don't think I'm not guilty of doing the exact same thing mind you. I did it just last week and the entire time I was telling myself I was being really really dumb, but somehow managed to successfully pull it off and not wreck myself or others. But it was absolutely dumb and reckless to put myself there."
Nobody said he can't be there. But it's his fault that he's there. In a spot that it's terribly unsafe.
"It is on the passing car to complete the pass safely unless you are being forced off the track on either side. Trying to complete a pass by basically scraping down the sides of two other cars is not a safe pass. In most real world orgs, you don't have a right to be anywhere until your bumper is at their door, until that point, you are reacting to any move the car your in front is makes. A car on either side is not expected to know what a car 2 cars over is doing, it's not possible. If you out yourself in a spot with no way out, that's on you. 

I'm a real world racing compliance steward and OP is at fault every time here."
There was a gap tho?
"If you are going to be pedantic, then at least notice that when they picked their line the gap was smaller, and it relied on the car on the right moving over a few inches to make the gap a full car width.

And even if you are technically correct we could just slightly rephrase as ""zero *usable* gap"", ""zero *margin for error* gap"", ""zero *benefit when we reach the corner* gap"", etc 🙂"
"No sir. Too tight a gap in a game with funky netcode and excessive collisions calculations.Don't poke your nose in there. 

In AC/ACC, I'd say go for it, because the cars don't ricochet as much and the spotting is unrealistically good, so they can see you coming. Also LFM SR isn't as draconian as iRacing's, so a lil rubbing is perfectly fine."
"For real, oval etiquette is not the same as road etiquette and anyone racing to ""survive"" their split is in a completely different mindset than someone who wants to race for a win because they are not in a position to do so like OP here."
"Op made light contact. Iracing glue pulled the left side car to the right once that happened imo. He also did not fit. He shoved his way in and tried to shoehorn space. 

Regardless, it was a terribly silly thing to do."
"That wasn’t the question asked. Left car is totally at fault. You can easily clog that entire straight with two cars. Close the gap or make room for cars that are alongside you. 

It was a dumb but fully legal move."
"the gap is there. This all happens at extremely low speeds, they should all be able to react to it and not die."
This is the response i was looking for thank you 👍🏼
The best response so far
"No we can't agree they were 3 wide without collision. As soon as he got between them both he was contacting the guy on the left.

Even if he wasn't it was a very low percentage move. As the results prove out."
You can get DQ'd but it still doesn't change iR/SR outcome. Only championship points.
"Maybe.. Maybe the people I protested did have the race results updated later (I didn't go back and check, I wouldn't bother to do so), but I can tell you I personally have never ""regained"" IR or SR after being roally F'ed, multiple times... 

My understanding is nothing is done unless a driver is found to be a chronic offender, then, maybe, they get a mandatory vacation, but that doesn't change IR or SR gains for the victim drivers..

How sure are you that he wasn't DQ'd during the race and you didn't notice? If people are reckless, it doesn't take long to hit 17 incident points.."
"There was a gap. But not the right kind of gap. Think of it this way. The track is only so wide. And the line can get very narrow. So when you hit a “gap” that means three cars trying to share space. The outcome is likely to be this video. It is putting a heck of a lot of trust in two other drivers, and your skill. So yea, it is a gap, that can get pretty darn small. Why would you think jamming a car into a gap like this is going to let you just breeze past the cars that created the gap? The cars that likely are way more in tune with the person beside them, than someone lunging into a gap,."
"True, they most definitely assumed the gap would be there. If there was 1 or 2 laps to go, I would most assuredly say the move was justified. Off rip though, I would’ve lifted slightly and held in line behind the black car."
Agreed. I wouldn’t find myself making that move. It just seemed like there were errors from multiple parties. But after watching it a few more times it seems op made contact first
"The left car wasn't the one who decided to go 3 wide off the start in a rookie race. 

The OP fucked around and found out. It was their fault, they screwed up, they ruined the race of two other people while doing so, and telling them anything else is making online racing worse for everyone involved."
"He's so right. Self preservation is the key, at all levels but especially at the level you are at. You got lucky, but any time you go three wide is a risk. More often than not this will lead to an accident and more often or not you will also be wrecked."
This is what I was trying to articulate poorly
"Yeah I’m pretty sure it has to be egregious 

This guy punted 3 people who passed him in the exact same spot"
"Yeah in the last laps I think that's more sensible

Making it 3 wide on a narrow track like Summit Point will 90% lead to this result, especially at the start of the race when no one has been able to build trust (or otherwise!) with the other drivers!"
"What is illegal about going 3 wide when there is enough of a gap for going 3 wide with no contact? 

Nothing. 

Was it a stupid move? Yes. Was it within the rules? Yes. The two dipshits on the sides should have either closed the middle gap stopping this before it starts or made room. Period."
"> What is illegal about going 3 wide when there is enough of a gap for going 3 wide with no contact?

As I pointed out before: just because something is within the rules doesn't mean it's right.

> Was it a stupid move? Yes. Was it within the rules? Yes.

Doing a stupid thing that is within the rules that ruin's someone else's race is *wrong*. 

> The two dipshits on the sides should have either closed the middle gap stopping this before it starts or made room. Period.

""Everyone around me should have perfect situational awareness and should take drastic defensive measures if they don't want me to do something that'll end their race before we make it to the first turn"" is a justification that someone who's wrong uses. Trying to pin this on the people who *didn't* make any aggressively stupid moves is wrong."
"Did he get between them with no contact? Does your spotter point out 3 wide? In your own experience, do you provide more or less space when you hear 3 wide?

If this crash had to happen, it happens turn 1 when no one backs out. Not in the middle of a half mile straight with more than enough room for 3 cars. 

He’s not at fault. He didn’t turn left, the left car drifted right and put maneuvered himself against a car that gained its place along side him COMPLETELY LEGALLY. There is your fault. Which is what was asked for."
"I don't know how people don't understand this
Whilst the OP did go into a gap he shouldn't of... I would of too, The people saying that it never happens IRL... It does.
It's on the overtaking car to make a clean overtake sure, But he was there, He got into the whole cleanly and was driving very straight at the point of contact, Where both cars on the outside were not. Clean overtakes come when all parties are playing the same game, But unfortunately in rookies you can't rely on them to be playing the same game as you. It's a battle royale out there.
Fault is on the 2 cars squeezing the middle car imo."
"> Does your spotter point out 3 wide? 

The spotter is disabled for the first 20 seconds of the race and this clip is 19 seconds long.

So no, nobody's spotter pointed out 3 wide. Unless both these drivers, in a new rookie Mazda race are using triples or VR, it is extremely unlikely that anyone but the OP knew that they were 3-wide."
"It's done when it's done, they don't tell you how long, but it appears they had issues because it's a minor update, and usually they take around an hour. If you download the companion app it notifies you when it goes down and is back up."
"How long is a piece of string?

...I'll admit I'm also feeling frustratingly impatient at this point though."
Soon
Dudes we're back!

"I wish I was home, I needed an extended test drive session!"
Got the notification its up
"I'm the red car being bullied. this was for the overall lead in the race. Homie gave the position back in the heat of the moment but didn't have to by any means. tough but fair racing, everything people dream of when they hit the sign up button, least for me."
"I notice the session is an hour old when you leave the pits, is there any chance you left the engine running for that hour?

At Spa24 last year one of the teams in our split pitted for a 1 hour repair, stayed in the car with the engine running, overheated it and blew it on the way out of the pits leading to a 4 hour repair

Other than that, I'm not sure what it could be apart from a bug"
How long did you leave the car running in the pits before driving? An hour?
"Interesting, it was already smoking before t6.
Anyways, report this in the forum urgently, in case this may be an issue for D24"
Why do yall keep saying they left it running in the pits? The video starts with them turning on the car.
"While practicing for the D24 my engine blew 1 lap into a full fuel run, has anyone else run into this?

It was my first time running this set but I ran a full stint straight after this without a problem,

It's got me pretty worried heading into the 24 cause I have no idea what caused it,

Video in case anyone can spot something I can't"
You cut off the beginning part of the video when you left the engine running for 15+ mins while sitting in the pits before you went out.
"Same thing happened to me when proto/gt was at Daytona last week.

Downshifted for the 2nd infield hairpin, motor hand grenaded. It was on my our lap"
"Weird, you didn't do anything out of the ordinary. If it's not what someone else said about leaving the engine running in the pits, I'm going to go *way* out on a limb and blame the fact that you touch the wall slightly before the bus stop. After the whole Ross Chastain wallriding business, iRacing has applied a weird power cut when a car touches the wall of an oval, and that includes GTP cars on roval tracks, and it's not always shown clearly on the replay. That might have somehow messed things up?"
You can hear him starting the engine just before he drives away.
I bet money this guy left his car running in pitlane for a little bit
I have put in a support ticket so I'll update if I hear anything back
Sounds like the car starting at the beginning of the clip?
"That could very well be it, quite frustrating if that is the case as its such a small touch, will have to keep it in mind for the 24"
"Yeah it starts up fresh at the start of the video, I'd only just loaded in and the session was about 10 minutes old. I didn't get around to recording the video until after I'd run a stint"
"Do make a post if you hear anything from support. I don't believe my wild conjecture for a second, I just can't think of anything else."
The session is an hour old. One hour elapsed out of two.
"I did end up getting a response back from support. Fairly generic but sounds like they're looking into it.


Thank you very much for bringing this to our attention and providing this information.



We will report this to the proper team to look into further.



Please refer to future release notes on the Staff Announcements forum for any updates on this issue; https://forums.iracing.com/categories/staff-announcements



Sincerely,

iRacing"
"That's the time elapsed when I recorded, not when the issue actually happened, I ran a 45 minute stint before recording the video"
Yeah that's what I've got the couple of times I reported a potential bug in the past. But in each case I got an actual human response soon after with some more details. Probably not before Saturday though.
common denominator
800 rating in 3 days? That is like 10 DNFs.
"Hey look it's another thread where the OP supposedly filed a protest and therefore has the replays saved.... but no clips to be found 


HMMMM"
"So, a couple of things.  


1. Getting wrecked sucks but if it ends in a DNF; that's generally on you. Are you returning to the pits, getting repaired, and getting back out there? If you ragequit after wrecking, your iRating losses will be significant.
2. Are there things you could be doing to anticipate and avoid wrecks? It's not always possible, and there \*are\* some jerks and idiots on the service (especially in some series), and there probably is an uptick of that as folks got wheels and things for Christmas and are new to the service. But generally speaking that many wrecks in a row suggests there might be more you could be doing. Sometimes you have a choice between not being \*at fault\* in an incident, and not being in an incident at all.
3. The stewards certainly do punish bad behavior. There are examples on this subreddit of people who have been banned. As the goal is to grow and learn, they'll be notified and warned first. But this becomes a mark on their record. There's no need to feel like ""nothing"" has been done. In fact they've been warned and notated and if the behavior persists, then they'll be banned. But if the behavior does NOT persist; then the warning worked and the behavior was corrected. And isn't that what we want?"
"Oh look another its them not me post. Yawn.

Common dominator in all these crashes is you. Skill issue."
What ranks are you driving?
Another one of these posts eh?
Shit I’m up 800 running PCC since it swapped to rudskogen.
I’m guessing it’s a combination of new drivers (Christmas presents) and putting yourself in bad situations. You can see the overly aggressive drivers and just let them go. Most likely you will see them crashed later. As far as losing 800 points I don’t know about that I’m no expert.
dropped 800 IR just in time for Daytona 24hr!
"So then just do it back to them. If no one gets banned, you wont get banned right?"
Stick to races with C safety ratings or even better B and A.   It will make you a better driver and if you can keep it clean you will gain your irating back quickly as most will have more irating than you
Can agree. This shit has been a joke as of late.
Don’t complain on this sub dude. Full of fanboys here. Now downvote me please 😂
[deleted]
If you smell shit that much check your shoes
I feel bad for the op. Just wants to vent lol.
At least you’ll get in lower splits and can win some races. Don’t care about your irating. Just focus on your safety rating.
Focus on finishing not on your position
"yep. it sucks too. People are trash. Admin, bad drivers, trolls, and especially the blowhards here who say ""do better"" or ""thats just the way it is"". Stupid that humans cant come together and create something fair and enjoyable for everyone involved, and you PAY money for it. I started about 60 days ago, and I havent raced in a week bc Im so pissed about it. And judging by the comments here, its not going to get better."
"For real, you need like 8 DNFs in a row to lose -800iR that's more than bad luck."
Always has been
This is a cliche now. It's not always true.
This has been the most infuriating 3 days on this ~sim~
"Yeah, that's ragequit territory.   


Open Wheelers are my jam which means wrecks are just a fact of life. Including the intentional wrecks from absolute troglodytes. But I rarely lose iRating even after a wreck because half the field in some of these races end up in pieces and so many quit after wrecking. If you just repair and stick around and limp from the back you'll have a salvageable result that will, at least, not \*significantly\* hurt your iRating."
"Well, to be fair I only send replay files to the stewards and never have a clip of my protests. I don't bother saving video files. Not saying op is not an ass though."
"I save MY replays, I don't file protests, and how narcissistic are all of you that you feel like you're owed someone else's time and effort to upload ANYTHING, because you demand it. You kids are something else. I wouldn't post a single character, because one of you narcissists demanded it."
you are part of the problem

"SF in Road Atlanta is free iRating this week, if you can avoid the ""Too much damage, we are done."" Also, I think there's a lot of high iRating drivers which don't fully understand the inputs of this car, and you can see that a lot of 4 and 5k guys are spinning and crashing at the exit of the apexes because they are using the pedals like an F3."

"I'm asking ranks because the lower ranks have lots of people who don't have tons of time in sims. Mistakes will be always be made. Like running hot into turn 1.  Even happens irl to professionals every week. Look at turn 1 every week of the F1 season. You can't just ban everyone who gets into an accident.

There are two sure fire ways to avoid turn 1 incidents though. Be the fastest and get there first. Or anticipate the turn 1 wreck and take it super easy into it. Use your mirrors to let dive bombers through and let em wreck. Then drive passed smiling and waving. 😁

Sometimes you gotta stop sweating, chill, stay loose and drive your own race. But you gotta remember you're mostly just racing with normal people who aren't pro drivers and will make mistakes."
[removed]
"It absolutely does not ""encourage"" intentional wrecking.  


People don't need to be flogged and shackled the first time they do something stupid. If they get warned and then never do it again; how could we ask for an even better outcome?  


iRacing stewards are not the morality police. They're not trying to figure out who the good people and bad people are and beating up the bad people. They're trying to make the service better. If they need to remove someone they will; but if they can have a conversation with someone that leads to better racing that's an even better outcome.  


I understand being frustrated having a race ruined or having your SR or iR take a hit; but banning people for a first offense isn't going to solve anything and you're going to feel awfully differently if you make a mistake that someone misinterprets as something intentional and is able to successfully protest you."

F3 and F4 and the occasional proto & Ferrari
"Yeah, that’s absolutely true. I also have my suspicions, based on some experience in SF, that it’s the first time some folks are racing without a racing line (since it’s prohibited in B class races)"
"I think you forgot to take your medications, and yes, you are a narcissist."
"Full agree.

 I've been racing in the 1000-1300 range and regularly having great races with people in the P1-P4 range.

This week in particular every race I've done has been multiple laps of near bumper to bumper driving on Charlotte.

That said, the first lap is always the hardest. And really it's not even the first lap, it is the first few corners.

The biggest risks are the people qualifying mid pack trying to make moves on the first couple of corners with cold tires and no sense of how the other drivers drive their car. 

Qualifying mid pack at the low ratings is tough because you are often in the middle of whatever mess happens. If I don't qualify near the front I'd rather start from the back so I can just drive around the carnage."
"Not to mention, at that irating, jumping between four different series doing multiple races across those series is never going to guarantee you are at the best you can be for each car.

At that irating I might stick with one or two to get more competent to build ir in to higher splits."

And the very next sentence when he’s saying that is that the overwhelming majority of people issued warnings do not reoffend.
So 4 different Cars/Series in 3 days and enough starts to go down 800… can I have your free time?
F4 and Ferrari are never very clean

"Unfortunately for us, it sounds like we got someone who wouldn't learn after a warning. "
"The key is to not practice at all, quit after 1 lap, then sign up for another after you forfeit. In between loading screens you complain about the person who hit you last time."

"No way, are they doing GT4/LMPs around Bathurst. That’s gotta be a shit show but glorious at the same time lmao"
"I have a real love hate with this car. 

Love: 
Engine go vroom
High downforce 
Difficult in a fun way to drive 

Hate: 
THAT GIANT F****** A PILLAR MY GOD"
I want to be “good” at Bathurst… as in not using the racing line!
Ran this combo the other night! Really fun and stressful. Have to be very careful how you time any moves on the mountain.
"I've never gotten wheel hop at 110mph before, but this week in the LMP3 offers plenty of it and it's absolutely terrifying."
This might be my favorite car I’ve driven around this track
I think the track is awesome but damn I struggle with pace on it. Worse than any other track.
lol Bathurst is intense in a bicycle
The pure chaos while learning this track driving a gt4 and one of y’all go blowing past.. it’s what I’m playing the game for lmao
"I'm doing the GT4s in this, and it's mega fun. 

Feels like it's either + or - 0.25 SR per race haha. If you qualify or miss the first lap shenanigans, it's been clear and great racing. Or it's a shit show on lap one, and you get 8x before you even get to the top."
That’s some goooood racing! Enjoyed watching that
Did this last night and only had gt4s in the race. Weird but fun.
"Qualifying is very important... you want to be at the front on the first lap or two so you avoid the diehards. 

I won the 23:30 in the LMP3, I'd say that from the front everyone displayed good multiclass awareness."
"If you can get a little luck to survive the lap 1 pileup its a blast. Looking forward to IMPC this weekend, first time I'm able to run it in that series since I'm not running Daytona and IMPC Bathurst always seems to coincide with a special event."
"Bathurst is one of my favorite tracks. So challenging. Lots of relief, twisty and narrow. Get consistent there and it feels so good."
Feel like I’m driving a cruise ship going through the mountain section in the M4 lmao
I knew exactly which series this was going to be.
"Title: this car track series combo is great!

*doesn’t mention the car, track, or series name*"
you lmp3 drivers are brave souls
Wow this audio scared the shit outta me
This is one of my favorite tracks. It’s fun in any car.
"I’m so bad at this track, I just can’t figure it out, I think I’m gonna skip races this week."
"Had about a 15 car pile up halfway up the mountain in my race tonight. I was about the 4th car on the scene. I actually slowed but the road was blocked and they kept slamming in behind. 

Can’t wait to run it back tomorrow. f in the chat for my SR"
It is definitely both.
"I must admit I hate both of the Falken series.  
Thought it will be fun but nope.  
One mistake in the fixed 15min Series and you wont get back your iR or SR because of the short time.  
And the multiclass version is the mentioned shitshow on every racetrack. :(  


For one who can afford time to drive 2-3 races a week plus training thats an absolute killer :("
"I'm terrified to even try, I can barely get round this track without faster classes giving me the fear."
"Yeah the pillar is terrible, I moved my POV a little to the left to make it a little better"
You realize you can move your pov right? Lots of people just drive this thing as a center seat.
"Turn it off, watch videos and practice bro, you’ll get there. My normal routine when I was learning new track and even still to refresh my memory is watch videos(from VRS) and then practice three laps and then watch the video again but this time playing more attention to braking points, turning points and trail braking and then practicing more again. Good luck bro."
Practice makes perfect!
"It’ll take some getting used to but it’s absolutely worth turning off. Once you get used to running without it you’ll not only realize you’re faster but that you also know the track MUCH better. And you’ll start learning how to take better/creative lines at other places. The racing line isn’t always the fastest. 

Another thing that I feel like doesn’t get talked about as much; you’ll do much better in traffic when you aren’t glued to the line."
"It’s actually not as bad to learn as I thought it be, took me maybe an hour yesterday? I used active reset in a test session to learn the uphill portion, then the downhill portion, then the straights.  The nice thing with active reset is you can set a section and run it a few times with the line on, then reset and turn the line off, and then run the section until you have it learned. 

I found it much easier to learn it this way because it’s such a long track with decent odds at damage so this gives more passes at the sections that need lots of seat time to get a hang of."
One mistake and then you can start counting bodies( all the people behind that are going to pile up)
![gif](giphy|gfxr0xTRJW07GpYxrK)
" It’s better for your SR to not know, im just trying to protect the ones that don’t know yet."
"It’s the Falken multi-class series, C license, it’s a pretty intense series, but this week it’s insane in a good way, but if someone in front of the pack makes a mistake it can go very wrong for all the ones following, seems like most people don’t care about yellow flags and they just plow through ruining the race for others and themselves, it’s awesome 😆"
Yeah so I ended up running in one earlier tonight. Was an absolute blast. The ppl I was running with were super classy. I ended up fking myself over more often then not lmao.
"I'm using monitors and I moved my view fully to the center.  Makes a huge difference, with triples I can actually see well out both side windows and I have a good view out front."
Thanks for the advice! Just starting to dabble in road after 4 months on iRacing. I think I enjoy it more than oval. Love racing the track!
Is VRS free?
I gotta look into active reset
If you bin it on the first few laps just tow AS SOON AS YOU STOP. You'll be a lap down but you can carry on and gain positions from everyone that didn't and gets punted off the mountain.
"I’m just in d class anyway, jsut joking around lol"
"That sounds great. I get those races in 1/1000.And I even hadn´t had 300 races ... so ... still looking for them :D  


Me and a friend did the VRS endurance on Hockenheimring last Weekend and the driving in the bottom split was sooo great and respectful.  
3 hours of pure joy!"
"You pay for the setups, but i believe you can use their telemetry for free and you can also watch their replays for free, but not the video with more detail tutoring."
"Took me 3 years (early 40s, 3 boys under 5 at the time) but I got a bonus one year and decided to do a full year of NiS - about 15 tracks in one hit!)  And then never did NIS again!"
I was fresh out of school with few responsibilities and disposable income... I bought every road/oval car and track as I climbed the ranks. Not a proud moment. But I never cared for the update owned feature because update all worked the same!
"Less than 6 months. Simultaneously proud and embarrassed 👍🏻☺️👍🏻

Edit: I don't have kids."
10th dec 2022 was my first purchase with the 40+ discount. I joined Feb 2022. So 10 months?
"Within the first 3 months easily.
If I had my time again I'd have bought 40 straight up as its the cheapest way."
Been racing since July 31 2023.  My next purchase will be a 40 club one! I try not to think about how much I've spent.  It hurts.
18 months or so.
"It took me almost 2 years. First year I was pretty busy with work so I’d only buy a track or two a month and by the second year I was racing every night and climbed up the ladder system really fast.

Now I have more time but I race considerably less."
You're a mad man!
All pride my friend if it weren't for the kids I'd be right there with ya lol
Putting me to shame
Man y'all making me feel like a slacker lol
Are you looking to race this weekend at Daytona ?
Dont ask about framerates here - everyone goes mental if you even mention a 240hz screen.
"Which headset, what graphics card?

Forum has reports of micro stutters with a bunch of Nvidia drivers, check there latest without issue."
"I have been having a similar issue. Prior to the last update I had a solid 90 fps in VR at Daytona, but after the update I would get occasional stutters.
I have a 13700k, 4070 ti, and HP reverb g2."
"I went to g9 oled because of this issue, i got tired of tweaking and i have a 4090/7800x3d"
"Bro SAME! My fix was turning the shader settings down. Got back to solid 90fps, got occasional stutters at Donnington, but then they went away. Tonight I'll try putting the other settings back up to see if I've actually solved it.
5800x3d, 2080ti, 32gb RAM, Q2 turned down to just under 1.0 res."
Have you tried using virtual desktop and openxr? The game runs so much smoother and less stress on my PC
"iRacing is updating their engine for weather, the game is getting harder to run every update."
Why? I’m still torn between running my g9 at 240hz medium settings vs 120hz at high settings. I know theres less latency but not sure if it really matters.
You again...
"reverb g2 3080ti, which forum ? thanks !"
I realised it got worse if there were smoke particles or sun glare. If its the same for you this might be the fix
What upscaling setting do you using in openxr toolkit?
Apparently NVIDIA drivers have been causing issues for a while I had to roll back to October of 2023. All fixed now
"Have you tried both?   - For me just seeing a smooth higher framrate 'feels' better straight away.     
If not then, turn up all those setting until you do see the stutter, and then dial back a bit."
"Yeah, like I said seven hours ago - I posted it to a couple of other threads that mentions frames/fps in the title.     
It's OK, I realize I touched some sort of nerve in the iRacing sub of the hive-mind.  I'll shut up about it here, I promise."
"Iracing forums - virtually reality sub forum.

https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/50467/fps-drops-seen-in-vr-with-two-latest-nvidia-drivers-545-84-545-92#latest"
I actually have no clue I'll check now
I have it off
Yeah i cant tell the difference but i am 36 so maybe I’m just getting old
Thanks for the help I just needed to roll back my Nvidia driver about 5 updates or so. Back to October last year
Awesome thank you
Did this fix your issue?
100% yes
Awesome! Glad you've solved the issue.
Garage 61.  Loads of setups to try for free.
"Online sessions in IMSA and the D24 series will have the bop applied for the Daytona 24. Test drive and hosted sessions won't.  Caddy has -1% Fuel and -.75% power for the BOP which seems minor but will contribute a lot to a loss of pace. 

Practice sessions also aren't always the great indications as track surfaces change and I find that late into a session it's just in an awful state that makes it hard to put down comparable pace to laps earlier in the session. "
I cannot get off a 1.35 and will fight you
Thanks for the tips ! 😁
"Ok thanks a lot for those informations, didn't know all of that 🙂"
Where do you find those information about bop setups ? 🙂
What do you mean by that ? ( sorry English isn't my native language 😅)
"The BOP is in the special event thread on the forums. Usually when a week aligns with a special event (which is usually planned), the normal series gets the special event BOP applied "
"I was just being a smartass lol

You're complaining about being slow with a 1.33 meanwhile I can't go faster than a 1.35 😭"
"Ow okay 🤣 yeah of course , my post could be irritating for slower pace 😅"
"But I got that same feeling when a guy that run a 1.31 say, ""damn I'm not in my pace ""... I'm like "" You whaaaat ? "" 😯😯🤣🤣"
"Since you need the oval license requirement to race the series, even though it's at a road coarse and does road ir/SR, I'm guessing those starts go in the oval category for these stats"
"Sorry all, wasn’t asking how or why this happened, was just curious if anyone else had super low road starts but ok-ish ratings from being “just” a stock car racer."
"Yep, I believe so. Just thought it looked funny that I’ve got an A license and 2k+ rating with only 5 starts."
It comes over more like a wiki of information already out there. It doesn't seem to add anything new or particularly useful. New layout though. Hopefully you will add original content at some stage.
"Well laid out, nicely designed, but all the articles come off very much like a chat GPT prompt responses. Also the lack of any sort of illustrations or charts depicting the concepts in the articles hurts the overall utility of the site."
"The part about braking is completely wrong. You want to apply your braking force initially, not gradually"
"Thank you for your feedback, I will be definitely be updating the content soon and adding some more in the future but I thought I'd get the website up and running for now for some early feedback. Much appreciated! :)"
"It sucks that ""it's like AI"" is considered a valid criticism now. Students across all disciplines must be fucked."
"Thank you for this, I definitely agree that some images/charts/illustrations would be useful so this is something I'll look at adding very soon."
"I see what you mean, but it's for people getting started. It's trying to tell people to stop slamming the brakes on and instead slowly/gradually increase the brake pressure over time to reach the limit. I will try to update the wording so it's a little more clear, thank you."
"Withdrawing from the race won’t change the safety rating you get, and you can’t do anymore laps."
yeah races typically have a time limit so it would end at some point from that. but probably also closes the server when everyone has disconnected.  no point in not leaving the race since you can't do anything in the race
Personally I don’t think we should get SR for these races.
"Bro remember to check if a race goes official, otherwise it doesn't count. Typical for series that usually don't run nords plus it's daytona week"
With only 2 drivers the race never went official so you were never going to get any SR.
I got +0.55 SR about 15 mins after I withdrew ffrom the race. Thanks for everyone's answers.
I just withdrew and didnt get anything for it. No I rating change and no SR change
What a waste of time. I only joined the race for the SR and didn't get anything at all
I mean you can still get sr if a race doesn't go official
That's crazy
"iRating was because there wasn’t enough drivers. Need at least 6 for a race to go official and count.

Safety rating in races with too few drivers counts at a reduced rate, that plus your crash means you must have only broke even on SR."
You didn't gain SR because you spun on your own and broke the car.
you did get sr. ir wouldn't be affected due to it being unofficial. but sr still is. just the ui doesn't show it. website shows it thought
oh really? I didn't know
It's a long race and so u predictable on Nord's so I guess they gave me mercy
Yeah. Ranked series always affect sr even if unofficial. Thought i think it is at a reduced rate
"I was just reading the sporting code last night where it talks about the equation for SR and I thought it said that if it wasn't official due to not enough racers, it wouldn't count or it would be much lower than usual. I can't remember which one now, but regardless, that's way more SR than I thought you would have gotten. How long were you racing?"
"Ok so I checked. SR is affected but by much less. So if you drive an unofficial with the goal of getting more SR, there is way better stuff to do in life in the same time bc the chance of binning it is still too high"
About an hour I think. Isn't it about how many corners per incident you have? And its worked out by that somehow.
i think it's similar to time trials
"Yeah, it has something to do with number of incidents per corner. The type of lobby your in affects the rate, so for example races will be a 1x multiplier while practice before qualifying is 0.25x multiplier. I don't remember the numbers as I'm at work, but you can check it out in the sporting code when iRacing is done updating. You also get an award for reading for sporting code 👍"
I got the SR about 20 mins after I left the race. +0.55
"If you haven't already, add some nice headphones. It adds so much to hear a loud ass engine going, tires screeching, and nothing else."
"I love it, pulling that head set on after gridding feels like pulling a helmet on.

VR suits SIM racing more than anything else."
"Open wheelers are amazing in VR.

On a screen... I was very much ""meh"" on them.  

But in VR... wow.  The sensation of speed, the ability to see your car... to see the other cars.  It's amazing.

I still don't race open wheelers as my main focus, but getting into the FF or the Vee is like a candy break when I need it."
Nice! Congrats!
If you haven’t already (and your pc can handle it) set the resolution in your Quest settings to 1.5. I found this out yesterday after a year and a half and it makes as much a difference as going from screen to vr for me.
"The FF1600 is incredible in VR, I'm focusing on tin top cars, but racing that thing in VR might be one of my forever series once I'm able to do all the endurance racing and whatever else I want."
"I race with a quest 2 as well. It’s insane how much more I enjoy it as opposed to a monitor. Sure the image quality is grainy and not great, but there is nothing like the depth perception and immersion"
"The immersion is great with VR - only think I wish worked better was adding overlays.  Other than that, I wish my oculus 2's had a wider FoV so I could see out the corner of my eye as with a triple-screen.  But that said, VR is the way to go."
"I'm a week in using my oculus 2, so much better.

Still can't get the mic to work though.....been doing draftmasters and people keep talking to me to draft together and I can't talk back, but I'll keep trying."
What PC specs you running? Getting decent performance?
"I was the same way when I received a quest 2 at Christmas. Open wheel feels amazing, the depth of VR, I couldn't take the smile off my face."
"Rcently picked up the Quest 3 and the immersion is insane. My only gripe is whenever I take it off I feel like my eyes are a dumbed down version and I'm doing some damage to them. I know it may not be the case but I'm thinking about it so much that it's almost like a placebo effect now that my brain is convincing me its the vr set doing ""damage"". But damn is it so cool."
"Ha - have a nice pair of Sennheiser open ears. 

Agree though it's such a complete experience.

Didn't fully appreciate just how cool and immersive of an experience it would be."
"And flight sim! That 3d depth really gives you the feeling of leaving the ground on take off, it's really special"
"Ya I picked up iracing with no prior racing experience and no opinion one way or other other on which type of car besides just wanting to do road.

Really fell in love with the point of view and feel of the FF1600.

Fun to throw around corners and having an unobstructed view.

VR put it over the top -- feels like you are blasting around in a fast go cart lol."
"Running an older AMD card (5700xt) so pushing it to 1.2x is hitting the point where I start to see FPS jump around.

Lol - immediately had me looking at a new Nvidia card but don't really have the desire to spend that right now.

Definitely helped though, the lower resolution made some corners tough to see the line right until ontop of it."
"Actually fairly dated at this point.

AMD setup. Ryzen 5 3600x CPU and a 5700xt card. Was a build from mid 2019.

Ideally I'd be able to push the resolution higher but I start to get fps drop at a 1.2x scale.

That said, for hardware going on 5 years old plenty happy with it and it gives such a massive boost to POV and general awareness.

Had been looking for a used quest 2 but then Walmart ran a promo where it is $250 plus a $50 Meta store coupon.

Felt it was worth it just to buy new plus the return policy in the event I hated it lol."
This right here is my only question and the only thing holding me back regarding VR. I really don't want to F up my eyes. Can anyone else attest to this either way? I guess I could always buy from somewhere like Walmart as OP did and return it if it doesn't suit me.
Def agree about flight sim too. I can’t play msfs on a monitor now it has to be in VR
X-Wings in Star Wars Squadrons are amazing.
"I recently got a used quest 2 aswell, for simracing. But with the 5700xt it was a pain, so many stars had to align each time to get it to work properly, disable aws, got the FoV down enough to get decent frame times etc. 

I went and bought a 4070, and its just so much smoother, especially for iracing. Having stable 90fps with decent graphics all the time!"
Cheers!! That’s really interesting I’m running the exact same specs but thought it might not be enough juice for VR! You’ve got me thinking 😂
"I had to fiddle too much with it to make it work, not tried with current GPU (4070ti) and quest 3.

How's performance these days?"
"I'm using openXR, not sure if it makes a difference. Disappointed that the card was the last model to not support foveated rendering though"
"Ya I'm definitely not maxing things out so I think there is a healthy amount of relative perspective here.

I was using a 27"" (24""horizontal) gaming monitor -- so my FOV was severely limited.

Actually spent the weekend using my ""work"" 32 inch 60 hz ultra wide and the increase in FOV from that made a noticable difference. Drove me to go buy the VR headset since it was clear how much the lack of visibility was impacting me.

With VR I followed a guide so I have a decent amount of settings still on high. The resolution isn't awful but it could be better, and playing at a capped 72 fps doesn't bother me at all.

The benefit is significant. Corners simply feel huge - it's hard to miss an apex because it's such an intuitive experience now to hit them. 

Sense of speed is also better which in turn makes it easier to hit corners etc in a more natural driving way - it's clear when I'm over braking or coming in too fast and it's easy to adjust.

I'm sure if you already run a huge monitor it may not be as big. Similarly I can see why someone with triple monitors may not be as blown away since they already have a huge FOV and likely can run higher graphics settings.

But for me, it's probably the biggest improvement to my ability to drive."
Still demanding as hell but better than launch for sure. Msfs2024 is supposed to use more than a single core so that should make the most difference..
My 4070 works great with my Q3
"I used to use a RX 580 and R5 2600 (which was awful performance wise) and have recently upgraded to a 5700XT along with a 5800x and am getting excellent results. The boost from the processor has been bigger than the GPU, and is a slightly cheaper upgrade ;)

Also make sure to check the VR optimization guide on the forums as it has many useful tips!"
Think I'll hold out for the new one rather than tinker again with 2020
You can use a SimHub dashboard overlay. There are ones out there designed around the super formula so that it shows overtake mode information
I just recently bought a wheel with a screen for this exact reason.
I much prefer the car dash but it can be hard to get it in position. I just bought the Cadillac GTP and in order to view the wheel I have to have the camera back as far as possible and lower it several clicks. The problem is that then I can't see the apexes. If someone knows a better method let me know.
I use static wheel view in cars like that then its just like a dash
I was messing around with overlays and was having issues with keeping it on top of the iRacing screen. Was also not finding one that kept track of the overtake time. Probably need to look into that more and sounds like I need a specific super formula one. Can you map buttons to a controller to where it cycles through the dash options like you can in IRacing?
"Same issue with me. If I turn the wheel on, I have to go way back in the view that it throws everything else off."
I’ve tried this but then I have to adjust my field of view way back to see the steering wheel which is not great.
"Make sure you're running iRacing in windowed borderless mode. Overlays generally don't work with fullscreen mode.

In SimHub you can bind keys to page switching buttons, its hidden somewhere in the settings of the dashboard I believe."
"[Lovely Dashboard](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard) is adding push to pass functionality, it’s in the current beta release (you can get it now by subscribing through the discord for $1) and should be in the next stable version."
You can map a hotkey to look down
"Are you adjusting your actual FoV, or are you using the camera tool to move the seat position?"
This is actually a great idea. Going to try this.
Moving the seat position and shift horizon should help if they have the FOV properly set
Adjusting the field of view to be able to see the wheel but it distorts other things.
"Ctrl f12 and use the different axis to adjust the seating position. Youll maintain the same FoV, but can change your camera position to suit your needs (within reason)"
"Thanks, I'll give this a shot."
"A You move BEFORE he moves: defensive driving

B You move AFTER he moves but he is far away in time and or distance: defensive driving

C You move AFTER he moves and he is close in time and or distance and probably has to swerve or brake to avoid you: blocking

Regarding your question on moving to the inside to prevent a divebomb: perfectly acceptable defensive driving as long as you are not in scenario C, if you ask me.


Regarding defensive driving in general: defensive driving costs you a lot of time, use it wisely. If you are in lap 2 of 20 its probably wise to let a car pass by that is clearly faster and follow in his draft, lose as little time as possible. If it is lap 20 of 20 it is a different story of course and position becomes more important than time loss."
"Blocking is described in the sporting code:  8.1.1.3. Blocking - The leading driver is allowed to run a defensive line. However, blocking occurs when a leading driver  actively adjusts his or her driving line based on the actions and/or positioning of a pursuing driver. For example,  veering left to prevent a pursuing driver from passing on the left while running on a straight 

so you can defend the inside as long as you do it proactively"
It's defensive driving when I'm doing it and blocking when someone's doing it to me.
"Blocking – The leading driver is allowed to run a defensive line. However, blocking occurs when a leading driver actively adjusts his or her driving line based on the actions and/or positioning of a pursuing driver. For example, veering left to prevent a pursuing driver from passing on the left while running on a straight.

As per 8.1.1.4. blocking is reacively altering your line based on the attacking car's actions. In other words, you have to choose a lane. In your example, if you move to the inside to protect the dive before your opponent moves there for a pass, it's defending. If you do it after they moved there for a pass, that's blocking."
"In practice, I think there are two main situations it is okay to run a defensive line.

1. You go to the inside before the other driver does. Thus, your move is clearly not in reaction or taking away their line.
2. You go to the inside after the other driver does, but before any overlap is established *and* as soon as possible after tracking out of the previous corner. This is basically something that can happen because the driver behind you takes a narrower line out of the previous corner and so deviates to the inside first, while you are tracking out more fully like normal. But as long as your move is immediate and decisive and happens while there is still enough distance between the cars that the other guy doesn't run into you, it's safe, and it's not a move in reaction if you can sincerely say that you always intended to run a defensive line into the next corner from the moment you hit the apex.

A gray area is when you see someone pull out to overtake and then move in front of them to cover the inside line, but there is still plenty of distance between the two cars and time left in the straight, so your opponent has plenty of time to react to the move without having to lift. While I believe this is technically illegal on iRacing and wouldn't do it, I also think it's a commonly accepted behavior, and in many real life racing series there would be nothing questionable about it."
Not a clear answer but the best thing you can be for both parties to finish the race is to be predictable. Just pick a line and commit to that. The inside line is safest but not always optimal.
"There are pretty much defined rules on this everywhere

If you make more than 1 move in the straight leading up to a turn to block... you are blocking... but let's say you are down the straight and you make a move even after the person makes it... let's say to the inside.. you are allowed to do this.. but let's say the passing person moves back to the outside... you follow... you are now blocking

passing rules are simple as well... if you have not made it to 50% of the car... you have to concede the corner... if you pass 50% of the car with your nose... the passing car is allowed to get 75% of the car width on the outside / inside of the apex or exit... once you FULLY PASS then you are now the leader in that situation but you are not afforded being the leader until you FULLY PASS

  
this is common passing rules in both SCCA / NASA"
"I’ve observed that all these rules generally go out of the window in a race. Last f4 spa race, where the draft is pretty crazy, P2 passed me and then blocked my moves in draft, including mild brake checks, and then started driving a complete defensive line that would compromise his entry into every fast corner. He was slipping and sliding as a result and I was only trying to prevent a crash. I was called a slowpoke and wankstain for trying to make a legit passing move from the outside and in at the bus stop chicane, and he still rammed into me. The exact thing I was trying to avoid. So essentially rules won’t matter at that point. He drove like a maniac - let P3 pass both of us for a victory.

P.S. I understand that’s not you are asking. And I am indeed venting. Thanks for understanding."
Well put!
"Absolutely! If someone is faster than you, let them by and slip in behind them. If they truly are faster they'll stay there. If not, they'll bin it and you can wave as you drive by."
Can you report people for blocking or is it not really worth it? People do this a lot in the rookie/d classes
"Ref: The last bit - I completely agree. From a rules perspective it's a bit up for interpretation. You would never defend unless the person behind is in a position to attack, so you only ever take a defensive line ""based on the actions and/or positioning of a pursuing driver""."
just note that blocking is described in [8.1.1.3](https://8.1.1.3) now
"This only works up to a certain skill level, people can seem faster than you due to draft, and then be slow once they are ahead, best when they are actually good a defending in this position so you both just keep losing time and get caught by cars behind."
"The value of the protest is that you are making iRacing better for all of us. The blocking driver will most likely not block again after being told off by iRacing = better races in the future.

Ppl make mistakes in rookies, so it's the perfect place to learn what's allowed or not. 

Protests are not about punishment, but about improving the service for everyone, hopefully by education, but if needed: vacation for you and think about  your actions ;)"
You can protest. Worth it or not. No clue since i only rarely protest and only rarely see blocking that i would protest
It does specifically state that you are allowed to run a defensive line thought. Yeah theoretically it could be interpreted that way.
Thanks for the info! Haven't raced for a while so I remembered the old number
True. That's one of those things you'll learn to recognize over time.
"Also, if someone never gets protested, iRacing has no record of their prior bad behavior. It's extremely rare for anything to happen on a first protest other than a warning, but if they get protested six times in a week for blocking they might get a vacation."
Yeah there's just that slight grey area that if someone moves to take the inside line you don't have to just give it to them... you just need to move in plenty of time so it's clear what you intend to do before they are committed to a line or braking point
"Don't give up... once you have a bit more experience youll find yourself knowing a lot more tracks than you thought like the back of your hand. Also once you know the ""theory"" of how to drive fast you'll get better and better at learning new tracks with minimal practice time, because really it's all the same stuff with different scenery. Example, once you learn Maggots/becketts at Silverstone you carry that knowledge when you're learning tracks like Suzuka, COTA, Sonoma, anything with extended esses in it.

But thats why it's highly reccomended to pick a car and run an entire season of it, no matter what track. Yes you'll have to learn something new but by keeping the car consistent it's significantly easier. Not as many variables have changed. In fact learning a track is a million times easier than learning a new car.

Some of the best tracks on iRacing are the obscure, not F1/WEC/IMSA ones nobody has really bothered to learn yet. You don't know what you're missing out on til ya try it."
"How do you not get excited for a new track and car? It’s like a new game and challenge each week? 

Like what 🤣"
"Embrace the suck mentality is what I keep in mind when learning new car/track. I'm able to race after work and on the weekends so I donate an hour or two a night to just practicing with Ai. I'm doing it right now lol. I've noticed over the last few months of doing this that I may not improve in my first ai practice session, or even two sessions. But consistency is key. Just keep turning laps and eventually, you'll set purple times over and over. I will sometimes turn off all the black boxes and just vibe. And then check your times to see if you felt differences in the faster vs slower laps. Once I'm at speed consistently, time to race. Try not to worry about irating and enjoy the drive is the best advise I've gotten so far. 

See ya out there!"
"What are you driving?

Find a track guide for the car/track combo you want to learn. Youtube is full of them. Even if you can’t find a guide, there will 100% be a hotlap using any car/track combo you can come up with.

Track guides will be more in depth, but a hotlap will show you the line, you can figure out where they are braking and where they get back on throttle, and you can see what gear they are taking into and out of each corner.

Watch a couple laps, then go and try to slowly build into what you watched. The key is slowly. You can’t learn anything if you are spinning or running off track multiple times a lap.

Do 4 or 5 laps trying to emulate the line you saw, and then go watch the lap again. You’ll notice more every time you look at the video, and you’ll carry more each time you get back in the sim.

It takes time. Don’t beat yourself up."
"So you can go into races once they start as “ghost” driver. 

1. Click into a series
2. I click on entries to find someone who has a similar Irating and then click watch
3. It will bring you into the race, you can ride  along. with fast drivers to see braking points etc. 
4. Click test drive and you can race without any consequences, you are invisible to everyone, no off tracks etc. If you crash, just start again. 
5. Turn on the driving line, this is a great way to get a feel for a track in 10 laps rather than getting frustrated over and over. 
6. I’ve been on this service a long time and it took me way too long to realize it is better to just enjoy each race and stop worrying about irating. I was stuck on rollercoaster of irating for years, get up to 2k, drop down to 1.4, back up to 1.9 and drop again. I stressed and stressed and used to get really worked up, my girlfriend asked me who I was screaming at one night, she said she had never seen me that angry, I realized it isn’t worth it. Now I’m up to about 2.4k road rating and I’m competitive and have fun. Yeah I get pissed at bad rejoins etc, but I find I make way less mistakes now being less stressed."
AI races and AI practice sessions are a great tool for learning tracks. Most of the time iRacing does pretty well.
"Why are you jumping into a new car AND track?

You need to pick a car and get good with the car.

Once you get decent with the car, learning new tracks is a whole heck of a lot easier because you are learning the track - not learning the track AND learning how to control you car.

---

This is from the POV of someone who literally hasn't played a racing game until iracing and I just picked it up in November.

I've been racing the FF 1600 for about a month and a half now, and this week was the first week where I did maybe 5 laps, watched a video, did another 5 and then just jumped into a race.

You need to be effective enough at driving the car to keep it on the track in order to actually learn a track. Otherwise what you are really practicing is how to control your car around turns.. doesn't matter the track.. you will be spin out city because you aren't learning the track as much as you are learning the car.

Also, irating should go in the bin.. you want your rating to be around similar speed drivers so you can have good races."
"It's exhausting when you're just getting started and it feels like every week is a new track. That lasted quite a while for me, especially when I was in a few leagues - one week I had to race 5 different tracks!

Over time you build up that repertoire and it turns into one or two tracks a season. I now love when a new track drops and I pick a car and just jump in to check it out.

For now, embrace the punish, it massively pays off in the end."
"Practice more effeciently. Don't run laps - use ACTIVE RESET in a test session.

Seriously, if you're not already doing this, you're just making things way harder and far more time-consuming than there's any need to. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXgPGJ6BtLk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXgPGJ6BtLk)

Active reset so valuable and underrated. Learning a new track probably takes me 1/10th the time it did previously, just because I can easily practice the hard corners over and over and over without spending minutes preparing another go."
"It is by far the worst part of being new to sim racing, for me.  I have limited free time (work, young kids, a life outside of racing, etc) and I hate that I only really know a handful of tracks very well....and even when I do know a track, it takes me a while to re-learn it as I move ""up the ladder"" on Prototypes.

  
Once I learn a new track, I can generally beat 3-4k iR racers (I am only 2.5k myself with the small amount of races I've done), but it takes concentrated effort from me ahead of time to get there. A lot of ""skip the current week to learn the track for next week"" happens, which sucks.

  
Despite some success on the tracks I've learned, I absolutely have not developed or learned the natural driving skills to just hop on a new track/car combo and get up to speed quickly like some do.  Every week that's a new combo for me starts off as an absolute disaster, and I try to get it together in time to do some races :)

  
I look forward to the days where I know 90% of the track/car combos and can just race and enjoy the limited free time I have. So, you're not alone at all OP.  It is rewarding to learn the new combos in the end, it's just that the process sucks ass."
"I've been playing all sort of racing games for the last 35 years. It just takes me a few laps to learn the basics of a track now.

The more tracks you know, the easier it becomes to learn new ones"
"My process for new tracks. 

Test session. 15-30 laps
To learn the flow and remember the turns. 

Watch tutorial
See what I’m doing wrong

Test session 10-20 laps
Use the strategies

Review vrs telemetry 
See what turns need work and review data

Test session 8-15 laps
Work on the problem turns. 

Ai race to review my pace set to 75-110 ai
I will do this till I am top 5

If my pace is off I will run 2-5 ai races and review telemetry after. 

If having trouble in 1-2 corners I will jump back in test session and just work on those corners with active reset. 

Join busy practice session with 40 cars entered.  See my pace compared to top guys. If I’m top 3 I’m ready to race.  If I am off pace I will watch and review top guys laps. I will adjust according to what they r doing differently. 

This is the life of a 5k irating driver that doesn’t have the raw talent. I got to put in the work. Or else I will lose irating coming in at 5th."
"Just listen to a podcast or audiobook and drive around, without the goal of learning it. It's enjoyable, and I memorize tracks within 20-40 minutes this way. Nordschleife being the only exception."
Not caring about your irating helps a lot. Accept that you’ll be slower for a while as you get up to speed. Enjoy the process.  Early on is when you can find massive chunks of speed in every corner.
"Just get decent on endurance tracks. Enough so that you can keep it clean. You may lose a little irating through the first season but after running 300 laps in a race, you'll know the track very well and season two will go much better. Keep notes on what you had trouble with and your solutions for the next season. It makes things that much easier because you do forget the little tricks you do to gain time before you visit that track again. 

Endurance races are a good way to grind away at a track and still have fun."
"I know the purists will turn up their nose - but the racing line is there for a reason. Never feel shamed to turn it on help learn a track, where to put the car, where to brake. 
I don’t recommend using it once you know your way around, it can be more a limitation than a help - but for learning a car/track combo there is no shame at all"
If it’s exhausting for you… racing might not be your thing.  Don’t take this the wrong way either. I’m not trying to be rude.  I love racing. All forms of it. And learning a new track is one of best aspects of it I think. It’s fun to see your progression as you learn it and get better and better.
I've honestly put off buying a bunch of content because of it.
"Yes and no.  I can usually get up to my pace in a new track in about 2 30-40 minute sessions. 

First - I find the tracks trajectory, left or right corners. About 3-5 laps lapping at about 75% speed. 

Second - I start to locate brake markers and apex. Usually 5-7laps.

Third- start maximizing exits with conservative braking. 3-5 laps

Fourth - lay down a good lap.

Take a break and watch a lap from someone that knows what they are doing and  come back to do another 30 minutes. 4-5 lap stints focusing on good exits while pushing the brake zone bit by bit. Then do some races!"
Yes
I hear ya OP I'm fairly new I like to spend the first few days ( atleast 1 hrs a day)  learning the track an car then I do ai racer slowly upping the ai to learn from an improve my times. By Saturday I'm ready for real races get my 2 days of racing before I have to relearn another track lol.. but I'm ready for when the tracks loop back around !!!
I enjoy the challenge.
"For me personally it´s fun.  
I love the challenge of learning all the corners and getting faster in them.  


I normally need 10 rounds for learning the course and 10-15 more to get to 1-2 seconds behind the fastet guys in the training sessions."
"This is why I stop iracing for months at a time

Iracing for me is a commitment, and I'm not having fun unless I'm committed to the process. Once that process starts feeling how you described, I let my simrig collect dust until I feel like I want to race again. Then I start racing again by hopping into a week with a familiar car and track combo to reignite my motivation."
"It can be frustrating, but when I learn a new track and get to a level I'm comfortable with it's one of the most rewarding things in Sim racing imo.

There's a lot of good tips in this post. Apply some of those to make it easier for yourself and enjoy the reward of knowing loads of tracks after a while, including some less famous ones. Iracing has been great for introducing me to tracks I didn't know existed. 

Also - the more experienced you get, the less time you have to spend doing this. I can jump in on pretty much any popular iracing track and get around it safely instantly and he up to a fair speed within a few laps just through muscle memory. You'll get there."
"You can watch track guides, gitgud has a lot of them."
Learning new track on single monitor was always terrible. On triple screen or VR I love new circuits.
"Two approaches:

(1) Don’t pressure yourself to actually race on the track in a particular short timescale. Just enjoy the process of learning the ins and outs of the track, and hold off entering a race until you feel competitive 

(2) Let go of your iRating ego and embrace the loss while you learn the track, knowing that it gives you a better shot at a win when it returns to a track you know later"
"This is what I do. Do a couple test laps at a slow pace, just try to keep it on the track. After you’re kind of aware of what corner is coming next, I pick a braking zone marker and do the same distance for every corner. I’ll brake at the 100m board for every corner. Then I can dial in each corner, like for corner 4 I can brake later, the chicane I need to brake sooner, and I start to get more specific braking points. Then I’ll watch a YouTube video and see where an expert is braking and the line they’re taking. Then back to practice with that information. This will usually get me to being within 1-3 seconds of the really fast guys, and from there I have to just do races to get that last bit of lap time down, it happens almost unconsciously as I optimize. I do a handful of AI races to make sure I can get through a race distance without going off the track, then I try to actually beat the AI. And after I’m feeling like I can definitely do a race distance while being reasonably fast, I’ll take it to real races. The whole process probably takes maybe 2-3 days depending on the track. It may sound like a lot but I think it’s better to put the time in before hand and actually have your first real races be decent than to pull your hair out in some races where you’re getting destroyed and ruining your safety score"
Darlington has been a fickle bitch to me this week.
"It is frustrating, but when it clicks, there is no feeling like it."
"Yes me too . I bought some tracks to race and didnt even do it because i couldnt be bothered to learn he track and instead just went to race AI in tracks i knew ... pussying out of learning the track and racing it to not loose irating , shameful moments of my life :)"
"The only time it kills my enthusiasm is when I haven't been able to sim race in a while and come back to not having any combos I'm excited for or will have to shell out money for knowing I won't often use it. Sucks to not be able to race for 2 weeks, hop on iRacing, have to buy a $15 track, spend 1-2 hours practicing, then only have time for 1-2 races, repeat. It's definitely daunting at times, especially for more technical tracks"
"Sometimes, just depends on the track. That’s currently how I’m feeling learning the short Daytona track with the vee. Not a fun track to learn"
"I am learning Spa, Road America, and Sebring right now.  It takes time to learn your way around."
It took me almost 10 hours of practice to be on pace at silverstone 🥴
It’s one of my favorite parts of racing. Seeing the progress and finally beating a time or taking a tune perfectly is such a nice feeling.
"I do this week learning Bathurst for the first time.  That said, sometimes you just have to call it and get your race in.  I would recommend not worrying about your numbers too much, if you're gonna lose irating, you're gonna lose it, but these days when you're learning the track for the first time nearly every week will pass if you keep it up, and you can start fighting back.  It's a journey."
"Once you somewhat know the track, try doing Ai races for the combo that you are going to race. It allows you to get more practice as well as practice racing craft on that track. IRacing is intimidating as hell to me but I love it"
"What's your definition of ""learning""? Learning as in knowing where the track goes or learning as in getting the most time possible? When it comes to learning the track layout maybe I'm in the minority but I don't find it difficult. 10 laps maybe? I couldn't draw it out from memory at that point but I know it well enough to recognize that ""hey, that's that corner I can't go 100 mph into without crashing"". I would think it's easy to remember roughly how a corner works when you're staring at it for 5 seconds as you approach it after just a handful of laps. I never understood when someone feels they need the racing line and 2 hours of practice."
"Honestly. I had to learn fuji yesterday. I did 1 hoir of practice went from a 1:47 (stupid chicane) to a 1:38 which is 1 second off of garage 61s best time. 

It's watch a lap try it and tey to follow a someone or a ghost. It teaches you a lot."
"I certainly did when I was doing the GT3 circuit for two years. It ate up a bunch of hours. Eventually gave up and now enjoy racing at the lower echelons on usually shorter tracks. I think you probably need to find the point where the fun stops and it feels like work. If so, maybe consider other classes than the ones you are racing. I understand the frustration."
call me crazy I guess but I enjoy driving a car on a track.
"Not many tracks are super frustrating for me. The few that are I just can't find the rhythm for good pace.


Last night I was able to hop into Charlotte Roval in GT3, learn the track in under a half hour and easily won my race in my elo split even when a lapped car took my front bumper off after losing control and spinning directly in front of me halfway through the race. Sometimes it just clicks.


Then there are tracks like new Mugello where some of the turns require better driving by me and trusting of my grip to get faster but those are where I struggle the most."
Learning and mastering tracks to compete with others to see who has the best mastery IS sim racing.
do nothing but lap the nordschleife anytime you sim race in the last 5 years and every other track becomes just sections of that track at a different place lol
"Yes, absolutely. My first couple of seasons I came to loathing learning a new track, and ended up simply avoiding too many brand new tracks in a season. Either by driving other series, or just dedicating the week to practicing things coming up later on.

I'm in my 10th season or so now and I still only bring myself to one or maybe two new tracks per season.

It does get better and better though, not only does the amount of new tracks slowly decrease, but as I develop I'm able to find my footing on new tracks a lot faster. Just stick with it, and when you're not feeling another new track, just do something else that week. Forcing yourself to drive things when you're not feeling it is an excellent way to get burned out with the whole thing pretty quick"
Yes. Almost impossible! And I think it’s because are not real laser scanned. Very different to all other simnracing software!
"I basically play iRacing in the same way I play Forza lol. I don’t race online thankfully for all you guys. But I jump around to multiple cars and tracks many times in a play session. Doing laps and AI racing. Thankfully I own LOADS of iRacing content and buy new content on a whim pretty regularly. 

Last night I was lapping the 911 RSR at Spa and had a hell of a time. That car feels so damn good man. And up until last night I’ve barely put any time into Spa."
"That's my favorite part haha.

What I do:

1. Turn on the driving line
2. Get up to speed, while getting help on the line and brake points
3. Run a few races, with the driving line on, to get used to that track and where to pass and how to drive
4. Graduate to no driving line, and do some more test drives to learn the right braking points with no crutches
5. Send it

I can usually get that done in one evening, and then race the rest of the week. My main point here, is that you use the driving line to get racing faster than trying to ""master the  track blindly"" with no driving line."
I find learning a new circuit to be the most fun part of iRacing.
"Dont rush it fella. I know that feeling. I tend to learn one track at a time. I’m doing the IMSA series & I just recently learned how to drive Long Beach after being terrified of being on that track. One I learned the braking points & how to accelerate, it became such a fun track to drive. 

I’ll also drive other tracks I’m unfamiliar with very slowly & start from the back.

Or…maybe you’re exhausted & need to take a break for a bit. It’s a lot

Keep at it brother & pace yourself. But, I know this very well. Also, you’re (hopefully) not trying to get to alien level in 1 month so try the perspective of finishing but not necessarily winning"
"Just Turn On The Driving Line.. Of course, this strategy doesn't work for B class races and above.

I can become decently competitive within literally 2 or 3 laps.. It works.. No shame in this.. There is only one Max V.."
it's one of my favorite things. I've never ran in to a track a couldn't figure out in 10 or so laps. so i suppose if i was truly struggling after an extended amount of time i would get frustrated with it. i generally try and get behind someone i can keep up with and follow them and it accelerates the learning process a ton.
Turn on the racing line and have it done it 3 laps lol
"I like figuring it out actually, but I don't expect to win. I just expect to have a good clean race and finish mid pack. If I win great. Last night I had a blast with Formula Vee at Charlotte. First time on that track, finished 6th, but the 4 way battle we had going on for several laps made it incredibly fun."
Something I’ve realized is people take this game too serious some times. It’s okay if you don’t race your absolute best every time you race. Sometimes I learn more from actually racing than practicing. Especially seeing other people’s lines.
"Interesting; I’m the complete opposite; I really enjoy the process of working out a new track, far more than actually racing on it.  There’s something really satisfying about figuring the puzzle out, and paring it down to the fastest possible way around."
"Not sure if anyone else has mentioned something similar, but as someone who deals with inherent high anxiousness and can get nervous/intimidated with learning a new circuit (even in a car I’m comfortable with), one thing amongst other practicing tips I’ve always found to help me learn new circuits is launching an AI weekend session (practice, qualifying, race) and challenging myself to learn the circuit throughout that session (almost as a real life driver would), instead of just driving alone or sitting in an official practice.

I started out with sim racing in more local/sandboxed platforms like Assetto Corsa where a lot of my initial fun + learning came from racing with AI opponents, so doing a session in the same style as then takes off a lot of the pressure for me and I just focus on enjoying the process of learning the track + car combo and building up my times against the AI (and having the other cars around on track makes it feel more engaging and fun for me). I’ll set the AI in a pretty lowish-medium range so they aren’t running absolute top pace, but enough for me to build up my pace against in the practice session.

I’ll usually run a 1-2 hour practice, a 2 lap solo qualifier, then a race distance identical to the series I’m practicing for (always be sure to set the ToD + weather states identical to what the series is running). A lot of times I even learn the track quicker than I thought I would and leave the session before the practice even ends, then hop into an official practice and continue before racing."
Just started a month ago and learning a new track can be frustrating (looking at you oran park) and can tank irating a bit but by the end of the week I usually end in top splits and it's much more satisfying knowing I've shaved 5 or second off my lap time and am keeping up with the fast guys
No. To me its fun....
You can speed that up massively by watching laps and guides on YouTube for the same combo.
"It definitely gets better over time. Especially because after a while, a new circuit is basically made up of parts from old circuits. Or at least; it feels that way. It starts to come together a lot quicker. Especially if you stick to a car you already have a lot of familiarity with."
"I highly recommend learning a new track in a car that you already know. If you’re learning a new car, do it at a track that you already know. That allows you to focus on learning one new thing at a time. Trying to learn a new track and car at the same time is a recipe for disaster."
"Learning a new track is probably my favorite part of racing lol... it reminds me of going to a put-put course or playing those level-based mini games online. You get to apply your fundamentals to a new course, and you are constantly making improvements and trying new things. The difficulty comes when you are like 95% of the way to pace, but can't figure out the last 5% pace without watching some tutorial or spectating faster drivers."
"Never have been driving the indy car, but boy was it fun to randomly drive it at Nordschleife, random and good, even was at a good pace, only 20 seconds behind Verstappens best lol"
umm racing line to get 90$ of the way there and then follow others in practice sessions and watch the fastest cockpit cams.
This guy tracks
"yeah thats true, i learned about Road Atlanta because it was in the F4 schedule this season. One of my favorite tracks now!"
"Thanks for the encouragement... You're right that every track I get familiar with is one less in rotation that I'll have this same 'exhaustion' feeling with, so I guess I just need to take it slow.  


I think part of why I hit this wall (figuratively and literally) is because I tried moving over to to FF1600 so that I could move up to C license, as it doesn't seem like to you can progress out of D in the mazda, but learning a new car and track at the same time is probably a wee bit too much for someone of my very modest skill.  


It's just annoying to put my safety rating to waste by not getting the new license."
"I’m with you, learning the track and car is part of the enjoyment, but I can see how for some people learning the track to the point of getting the perfect racing line is the bare minimum and only the start to compete, especially in iRacing. I get impatient when it’s a car and a track I know well but I still need to study to prepare for a low stakes sprint race just to compete."
I do initially get excited but then the reality of my ineptitude smacks me back to reality
"I’m here for the dopamine. Learning all caveats of a track and braking points is time consuming work, as a parent its rather difficult."
Exactly. The reason I love sim racing is learning new tracks  and new cars and watching my progression as I learn.  It’s part of the fun of racing imo
"Thanks, yeah I know I'll get there eventually, but there's a very real time cost to doing that, which could be spent having a good race on something that I'm more familiar with. It's always so much easier to spend my time doing something that doesn't make me feel bad about myself, I guess."
"This is my third week in racing, the first two were spent in the MX5 (okayama and then Laguna), but I'm now at 3.3SR so I want to get my C license, but the MX5's don't give MPR so I tried a practice session in the FF1600 at Phoenix.  


I've never heard of or seen this track before, and I tend to not drive ovals, so I think all of that combined with unfamiliarity with the car (though I do like it) is the perfect storm to make me feel like I'm no good lol."
"That's an interesting idea, and I had no idea that it was a feature. I'll have to give it a try and see how it goes. Being able to drive along / behind people who are on pace sounds like an easier way to learn than watching lap guides (which I find that I struggle to translate into actual improvements)."
definitely.  I love running 1 hour practice sessions with 30 AI drivers set to a wide range of skill
I jumped into a new car and track because MX5s don't seem to have any progression path to C license.
This is so true that I don’t even wanna repeat it publicly because I don’t want my competitors to know 😂.
Does active reset still have the bug where you gain more grip each time you reset?
"This looks ***extremely*** useful, thanks for the heads up! This should give me a much better time of things!"
I certainly hope I get to that stage before I throw in the towel.
"its what iRating is there for, lose some iRating, race with folk who aren't as fast on that track car combo, have a fun race. People are to hung up on that number. Its literally a match making tool."
"I get the logic but I don't think I could do endurance. Fitting in the 30 minutes plus practice time for a sprint race is commitment enough, and I already struggle with being consistent in those shorter races."
"I agree that it can help if used the right way for a few laps. However, most people learn to brake where it turn red, then you turn it off and you are lost once more."
"I use it enough to find the flow and brake points. Turn it off to practise memorising it. Watch a race and ghost it to see other lines. Find a track guide to help adjust. Race it. Never takes longer than an hour to be able to race without being a hindrance. I just wish other people did this, every Tuesday you find lost racers!"
"Nah, bad take imo. Love the actual race once I'm up to speed with the car and track, I just don't enjoy sucking at the start.   


Also, I'm mostly a rally guy, where having to spend a bunch of time learning the track isn't really part of the equation. Being familiar with the stage certainly doesn't hurt, and will make you faster, but with the power of pacenotes you can actually be competitive on your first time as long as you're good with the car and paying attention."
What do you consider your pace though? I can quickly get up to decent pace but aiming for alien pace would take lots of practice.
commit to learning a couple more tracks lol
why would you race AI on tracks you knew....... You knew thats like the exact scenario you could learn the new tracks in right? lol
"I guess my definition of ""learning"" is to be able to cleanly and consistently make my way around the circuit where I'm actually a part of the race at my modest skill level (1500 ir)."
"I disagree. Most of my experience with sim racing is rallying. Outside of the driving style being extremely fun imo, I like that the structure of it is ""jump in and do it, you get one shot"".   


So, coming from that and having to be super, duper, ultra anal retentive about everything to be competitive on a circuit is pretty... trying. Once you know the track it's great stuff actually racing on it, but that initial learning process is just shit if you ask me."
"Yeah, that tracks."
You can run the MX5 in the Production Car Challenge to get your MPR for D class.  Then in C class you can run it in the Advanced Mazda to get MPR for a B license.
"Remember we are amateurs in a professional athlete's sport, we _are_ going to suck, relatively speaking.   It's still fun to go vroom, though.  

It gets better"
"You don't suck, you are as good as you are right now.  It is *impossible* to start good unless you are a real race driver. IRating is simply a metric used to determine who goes into what split, not a measure of your worth as a gamer."
"That is a tough car to master, and that is a tough track to drive a car that moves around that much.

T1 is a very difficult corner, and getting the left (is it T3?) into the near hairpin right (I guess that’s T4) correct in a sliding car is so hard.

That combo is a difficult stick to measure against.

On one hand, it’s easy to memorize, because there aren’t many corners. On the other, it’s highly technical and so easy to lose the rear at T1, T4, and the left (I’m guessing that’s T5) entering the oval section.

This is as good an explanation as I can find:
[FF1600 Phoenix track guide and setup explanation](https://youtu.be/AdlSn4unxfs?si=4YZKG1i7zqlTEOar)

I wouldn’t recommend running a low split race in FF1600 this week if you are trying to build SR to move up to C."
"Good luck and try to have fun and enjoy, funny part is, you’ll probably never feel fast enough"
"There should be an open series for MX5 for D license.

Read another post where you said you jumped into the FF1600 -- that is what I drive and I primarily do the rookie fixed series. It sounds like you jumped into the open series for FF 1600 and there should be a similar series for MX5."
Amen.
Normally that routine gets me to about a 5k irating pace. Probably need another hour after that to hit true pace of around 6-7k ir. That next hour involves tweaking the set up a bit.
"I know more than enough to have a full season of fun but alot of times when I decide to randomly come back the car I want to drive is just not at a track I like. Even if I know it, if I don't like it I'll just play or do something else. I have waaaay to many hobbies to not be having fun lol"
"I know , i just couldnt be bothered lol . As i said tho , not my proudest moments xD it s like u can just go in and have some fun instead of having to learn the track for 30 minutes beforehand."
"Yeah I stumbled across that and got my C licence today :)


Looks like I'll have to cough up and buy some tracks to progress from here though so I might just stick to the rookie series since I haven't raced on most of those tracks. "
"You're not wrong or anything, but it can be more than that on some occations, both on and off track. It's still counterproductive to focus on gaining irating as a primary goal, worry about improving your driving instead and irating will inevitably follow. 

Agree that you shouldn't look at it as as a measure of your worth though, that will inevitably lead to frustration and can zap the fun out of this thing real quick.

I think of irating in a long term perspective, making day to day or week to week gains/losses seem insignificant and making me able to take a cluster of mishaps in stride"
"Yeah you're absolutely right, it's not an easy combination.  Another Redditor pointed out the production car challenge which I had missed, that gives me MPR I need while being able to stick to the mx5. Just did some test driving then at Rudskogen and I'm already having a way better time with it. "
"Ah, the production car sim-lab challenge! Thanks, I totally missed that (probably because it didn't have a big fat mx5 logo staring me in the face).  


OK I'll go for that, cheers."
"That's very good, but what would that be in percentages to the fastest guys?

I need maybe 10-15 hours to get to around 1%,"
fair enough - and same for me. I jump from passion to passion. THey all burn out and come back.
Nice👍. The MX5 is such a blast to drive and the racing can get really close.  Whenever I have time I race it in all three of those series.
"By simply I meant 'simply put': not 'only used for'.  Irating IS functionally a world ranking of iRacers as well.  I guess my main point was - given the iratings of most people reading this post, our rankings are slessentially meaningless and stressing out over iR is very counterproductive and probably makes it 'not fun any more' for people."
"Have fun man!

That said, the FF 1600 is a blast! I personally really took to the single seat POV.

Definitely took practice to switch from the MX5 though, feels lighter and more slippery. Plus open wheelers get damaged easily."
"0.3% off normally. 

If it's taking that much time to lower the time then there is something fundamentally wrong during the laps. 

Probably one of the following- not using all of the track on entry, not hitting the apex, brake reference point not precise enough, brake throttle transition not happening at apex, hesitation during throttle application. 

You should be able to reach your limit within an hour or so. After that, you can gain a little bit."
"Then we are very much in agreement, I did read it as ""only used for"" but I see how you meant it now."
"I totally agree with you about the POV, I definitely plan to get into that car in time but for now I'll stick to the MX5 as to not overwhelm myself :)"
"That’s alien territory. Compared to that, I do a whole host of things wrong. 

First, it’ll take me some time to memorise the track. Doesn’t take that long, but still. Then I spend a lot more time trying different lines. 

Once I’m closing in on the optimum line, I can start testing the limits - and adjust the line when needed. 

This can take a while depending on track. Some tracks are trickier than others. 

When I start to feel fast I’m usually 3-4% off. 

Improving from there is what requires the most time. That’s basically a process of zooming in on the details and being more precise and consistent. 

For the last bit of pace I look at telemetry and videos on other drivers. 

The problems I find are all of those you mentioned.  Use every millimetre of track, get just the right braking point and pressure, get off the brakes just right, keep the momentum up, hold the car at the limit, with the right rotation… yeah, you get the idea. 

I mean, this is the hard part. When comparing telemetry to the fastest drivers the difference are small, but compound to a lot of time."
That's life on the internet I guess.  You either blast out a wall of text or leave it up to interpretation lol
100% there is an overwhelming amount of stuff to learn and sticking to one car is the way to go. Take time to simply learn how to fully control the car and the MX5 is great.
What car you running?
Ferrari gt3
It’ll be CPU because you’re now performing physics calculations for every car on the grid (in MP this isn’t the case)
Try turning off cubemaps. Turn both settings to zero in graphics settings. Helped me a ton
Their are some graphics settings in iracing that are just terrible and don't do much for you. Maybe it's more a settings issue than anything. I'm pretty sure their are some things on iracing that don't work no matter how crisp your pc is. Like cubemaps and a few other settings.
"If you open task manager and go to the performance tab, it'll show you how much each hardware component is being used. Click on the CPU to see if it's maxing out any of the cores, and keep an eye on the ram graph. I would assume 32gb is plenty and it's being bottlenecked by the CPU, but I could be wrong "
Cpu.
Limit the number of ai cars you are racing. This limits the amount of calculations your cpu is doing. Play with your opponent numbers until you get acceptable fps.
[removed]
Are you using VR or Triples?  I do 50 car fields with less of a system than you have on a single monitor at least.
"Something’s not right, I get 165fps @ 4k with a 7600x/3060ti on a 49 ultrawide"
"Check cpu temps to make sure they’re not getting too high. If so you may need a better cooler. In iRacing graphics Lower the settings of cars visible behind you, and maybe in front of you. There are some minor tweaks you can do in iRacing graphics that can help without losing much eye candy. I have almost the same specs as you and run triple 4k monitors without much slow down. Yes it drops at the start of a race with full field, but not enough to notice unless I’m fixated on the fps counter. 
I don’t think more ram will help. Focus on what you have and make adjustments with iRacing graphics, Nvidia drivers, and use some software to monitor cpu temps to make sure it’s not overheating and causing throttling.
Here are my current settings if interested:

"After reading your post I ran a test on my 10700k + 32 MB (DDR4@3200 MHz) + 3080 (10GB) running 1440p triples at Mugello with 40 GT3 cars (39 AI plus me.) Only on race start did the frame rate dip below 50. When a few cars were on screen frame rate was \~80-100. Memory usage was around 16 GB.

So I don't think it'll help upgrading your CPU or memory to 128 GB - it's already a beast of a machine you have.

&#x200B;

Edit: Nevermind - just saw that you'd figured it out."
Thanks brother that was the trick.  Instantly went back up to 150+fps
What do you mean exactly? Like settings that don’t have a visual impact but have a large FPS impact? I’m thinking it’s a settings issue honestly.
Yeah I need to do this. Hell could also just press the shortcut to pull up the Nvidia monitor tool
"Judging from the Nvidia monitor, I’ve got low CPU utilization. Under 20% and around 40 FPS with 22 cars on track at Zandvoort. Something isn’t right"
It turned out be the cubemaps. Honestly I’ve seen many people blame the other AI cars but why doesn’t affect other sims with many other cars on the grid? Is the physics of iRacing so much more advanced than AMS2 or ACC which have zero performance impact with AI racing?
I took it down from 22 to like 15 and saw now difference. Honestly I should be able to run 22 no problem.
"You’re posting that on every single iracing thread, seek help"
I’m using a single 49” ultra wide. Its gotta be some stupid settings on my end
How many cars? Which track? I’m thinking you’re right. I don’t remember it being like this a few months ago when I was really into running the 87 stockcars at Daytona and Talledega.
Thanks brother. It turned out to be the cubemaps setting. Disabling that put me back to over 160+fps with a 30 car grid. Weird how it’s obit a problem with AI cars on track. Maybe it’s applying these cubemaps to all the AI cars??
I'm so happy that worked!! Awesome
Share a screenshot of your settings. Might be a much cheaper solution to your troubles.
"Git you a r7 7800x3d if you’re running a friggin 4090, my cheap ass couldn’t pull the trigger and settled in the 4080 and I maintain 120fps easily at 7680x1440. Your superior gpu and seemingly adequate ram tells me it’s cpu related"
"20% is still enough to max out a single core, since the 12900k has more than 5 cores."
"I think it's iRacing that's badly optimized. Some games (like AMS2) use simplified physics for the AI.

And please edit your OP with the solution."
Agreed. 20 with your cpu should be doable. Honestly I haven't run any ai races for quite some time but the number of ai affected my fps dramatically. It's like there is hard threshold. I believe I was trying to run 30 at first then I dropped to 20 with little improvements so I dropped to 10 and it was good 15 still good 18 was on the verge so I stopped there.
2.   Both of which have FPS in the title.
RAM issues usually manifest as the AI doing weird things (which I had happen when I tried big fields with 16MB) as opposed to low FPS.
I turned off dynamic objects and that def helped a lot
"Me too brother now I can enjoy AI racing again. I don’t think I had the setting turned up when I was AI racing a couple months ago. 

In the meantime I had been AI racing in AMS2, which is a fantastic game in its own right, but it doesn’t feel quite as good as iRacing IMO. I love the car selection in AMS2. I wish so hard that iRacing would release all the 90s GT1 cars. Oh and group C cars 😩. Love them so much in AMS2."
Turned out that turning off cubemaps put me back up to 160+fps
Yeah I was just reading about this in another thread complaining about AI racing performance. For me it turned out to be the cubemaps setting. Turning them off put me back up to 160+fps
Done. The AI cars only cause a problem with cubemaps enabled. Hmm I wonder how many others have experienced this and didn’t figure that out. Otherwise it runs smooth as butter with them disabled and I now have a 30 car grid at Spa with no issue. It’s a blast.
It turned out the cubemaps setting is what was choking my system up. Disabling them put me back up to 160+fps with a 30 car grid
"16GB, you mean?"
Turned out to be cubemaps in my case. Turning them off put me back up to 160+fps with as many AI cars as I want
"Nice, I couldn't see a 12900k not being enough. Some of the settings are either too ambitious or outright broken. I am glad the community saved you a few hundred bucks to have the same result. I have a 13900k, lol."
What exactly do the cube maps do/where can I find them?
"Yeah total CPU utilization is a terrible benchmark for finding the bottleneck in most games with today's modern processors with 20+ threads/cores. 

Even if a game can make use of lots of threads there will still likely be one thread that is more heavily loaded than the others."
"Yeah, my experience has been 16gb isn't enough for huge fields but 32gb is.  I use a 2k 34"" monitor."
"Exactly lol thanks brother. I’ve been getting increasingly annoyed at this idea that a 12th gen i9 can’t handle 22 AI cars on the track at once. But that answer is literally everywhere someone complains about performance in an AI race. I mean I’m sure it has an affect but it’s not going to account for a drop from 160fps to 40fps. 

Plus all these other sims don’t seem to have a problem with AI cars on the track."
"Cube maps are referring to texture filtering, in that the first pass is tessellated and offloads to RAM under load, so that the CPU can put more processes on any given thread. I literally just made this nonsense up. I have no clue what it does, honestly. 

In the graphics settings, there’s two options having to do with cubemaps. I set both “dynamic cubemaps” and “fixed cubemaps” to 0. They were both at 3 I think? Not sure which one fixed my issue exactly."
"You made me laugh and then I googled it; if you made that up you’re pretty fucking close 🤣😂😂.

I’ll have to try that. I’m cool with what I’m getting rn but I’d love to see what my computer is fully capable of. I was running war thunder at 195fps in “Movie Mode” and I thought I was going to have an aneurysm from how nice it looked on my 55in tv. It was *chefs kiss* Crispy."
"Check your inputs to make sure you're getting 100% throttle when your pedal is fully pressed, and check your brake isn't dragging on the straight."
"Post a video or replay of your driving, if you want real advice."
"If it's fixed, and you're 100% sure you're getting the better exit. Then you turn the wheel too hard up Eau Rouge and Blanchmont to the point where it slows you, or have damage. 

These cars are also pretty downforce dependant, your entry and especially mid-corner speed can make massive differences compared to cars that rely less on it. There will be corners that have a ""too slow"""
"To sound like a broken drum, Trailbrake, Trailbrake, Trailbrake. With the F4 (and Vee) lift off oversteer can also immensely help your lap times BUT you have to practice controlling it and figuring out how it best works for you, I've found it especially helpful in gaining time at Spa turn 10 (Big downhill 180 degree after Les Combes) and the final chicane."
"Cut more of Eau Rogue, straighten it out as much as possible"
"With high downforce cars one of the things to get used to is how traction bleeds off with speed. 

I find a common beginner mistake is folks slowing down for a corner (of course), realizing they can’t make it, so they slow down a little more. And a little more. 

Often in these cars there are two speeds through a corner. Really slowly, where there’s enough mechanical grip. Or quite a bit quicker, where there’s downforce. Paradoxically, going faster than “slow” and slower than the “quick” pace will not make the corner because you have neither the downforce nor the mechanical grip. 

What you may need to do is spend some time in testing (use the active reset feature!) figuring out how to rotate and point the car early to carry momentum and speed through the corner as much as possible so you have as much downforce as possible.

Also keep in mind that dirty air plays a role. If you’re directly behind another car, you’ll have less grip than they do."
Don't worry about the F4 at all. It is where race craft  goes to die. Just move on.
Steer less
"Do you shift at the optimal point? Thats the only difference you could have in a straight line, otherwise your pedals arent calibrated correctly or you have damage"
I found a ton of time once I learned how much grip the car had in the corners. Once I learned to trust the car I got much faster. I haven't hit .22s yet though so I'm not one of the super fast guys.
thank you. my loadcell needed to be recalibrated and was at a constant \~4% braking pressure
make sure you don't trailbrake too much. A lot of people lose significant time by slowing down too much mid corner instead of letting the car roll and use the downforce. These cars are too underpowered for that.
"I wouldn't say the F4 is a high downforce car. More like a some downforce car. On the brakes you don't have to bleed off quite like you do with high downforce, and there's not really that effect of ""two speeds""."
"that just makes it easier to do well if you actually do have good racecraft 


or are you talking about yourself "
"Nope, yesterday was have amazing battles with driver for P4 on Rudskogen. Few laps of side by side action, attacks and defence. Live it."
"F4 is a blast! 

There’s a bunch of dinguses in F4 in the lower splits but they usually don’t last more than a couple of laps. Spend a couple laps warming your tires and avoiding the dinguses and then have a great race. 

If you’re trying to win the whole race the first time up Eau Rouge and are mad you get taken out by idiots; well, you were uh… one of them."
Bruxelles is a tough one for this. I find it the hardest corner on the circuit to get right
I believe it’s 7 days.

1. The UI has an export to json, not as useful when I just want to put it in excel.
1. I still can't figure out anywhere to do this via the UI or members-ng site
1. I find these super useful for seeing how a race unfolded.  I use these to see what happened in League while I was busy driving.
1. I think the old website had a search box that was super easy.  I think I found how to do this via the ""friends"" box on the new UI.  So, that's a win."
"Man I hate the UI, i used it last night. Changed the series to ""list"" and it kind of helped."
"I will miss it. Kinda goofy and dated, but once you get used to it I found it quite easy, just sign up for a race and join. No need to have the application open all the time."
Crap...I've never used the beta
RIP. I tried to resist but time waits for no one.
What I’m pissed off about is now we’ve lost the ability to see results beyond 90 days. Among many other things
"Always used the website just because it's what I've been used too and didn't like having to figure out the UI, but guess now we have too 🤷"
*Presses F to pay respects*
"I hate the UI. It's garbage, and needs to die. 

How do they make something less streamlined than the browser site?"
"I really fucking hate the UI launcher experience.

The scaling and coloring is so pathetically bad.

like what the heck is this opening page?  Seriously?  What is [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/0PtmQnl.png) mess of useless nothing that I land on every time it opens?  I literally only ever click like 4 buttons in this entire monstrosity and 2 of them are in the panel on the left.  The other two are to access results.

***AT LEAST OPEN TO THE DASHBOARD OR UPCOMING RACES!***

Half the time the sort feature straight up doesn't work, so I guess don't other opening to upcoming races, just the dashboard.

On that note, I fucking LOVE seeing races i'm ""eligible"" for only to find out that the track it's displaying isn't actually the track being run, and it's a completely different track I don't own.

Similarly, I hate that you're just EXPECTED to know what car every race is on the race list, based on a grainy, garbage logo for the series. 

Seriously?  You can't read half of them.  Thankfully you can click through them but it's still incredibly annoying how much space is wasted and you can't tell immediately what is what.




I also REALLY love that should you finally find and complete a race you can run, it can then only barely display any race results.  Why I can only see like 1/4 of the information the website UI displayed for the results?  What year is this?

Why can't I just see a table of the results like on the UI, that scales nice and neatly so I'm not scrolling SIDE TO @#$^ SIDE on a non-delineated table?


Why on earth are they doing this?  I tried the UI using the UI for two months not long ago and just couldn't do it, it was awful, like a bad beta test app.

The UI launcher has been so bad I've literally stopped playing before because was so frustrating it wasn't worth it, but then a bit later I would go back to the webUI and all would be good.

WTF do I do now when it shits bricks like it always does every two weeks?"
Well this is not great for me computer skills suck. My triple screen monitor is only one screen display is like I’m in a tunnel I don’t have it in me to figure this out I guess my rig is for sale. Sucks I really enjoyed racing
RIP. I remember having to join races through the TV guide looking UI. I could never remember if races were on the evens or odd hours.
"Member Since: 08-09-2008, guess I have seen a lot of change over the years..."
I broke over about a year ago. I’m gonna miss the old member site
I'll always remember the good times and the good forums. Remember when Black Friday Deals were huge savings...those were the days.
"I'll hit 15 years this year. 

RIP Website."
I signed up at the end of 2009. Recently I’ve only been using the website for looking up results and standings and such. Looks like all of that is still there for now.
"It still baffles me how unresponsive the UI is. For being just a shortcut manager to registering to and launching sessions, it underperforms massively.

Just getting rid of the useless animations would boost usability by a huge margin."
Man there is just some stuff missing on the app. Adding friends should be easier on the app
Wait what?! They shut the site down?!
11 years. I don’t play anything else.
"11 years and counting on my belt... damm things have changed a lot...

From the ice feeling we used to have in the tires to literally the launcher, all has changed...

Graphics have improved but not massively though, they are pretty good, but not hyper realistic... although I prioritise netcode/simulation and support of wheels and stuff over eye candy"
"Been signed up for a year so have only used the UI for racing.
The website was really useful for looking up series results. Anyone know if you can still do this on the website? Haven’t found it so far"
"2008 gang represent.

I still used the membersite for results. And buying stuff.

I'll miss it, but the UI is slowly growing on me."
"11 years, man its been a ride."
Dude I remember back in 09. Holy cow was it different. Looking at how far its come is crazy.
Year 12 begins in two weeks for me
2010 checking in
"I first subbed in 2013. To be honest I'm already mostly switched to using the UI + the mobile companion app. The only thing I've used the members site for is the stats and world records, as I understand those will still stay available for the foreseable future. The UI is pretty good for joining and checking available sessions IMO, I just recommend taking the time to customize it and put the series you actually race on the favourite tab so you avoid the clutter."
"14 yrs, wow.....I too suffer severe brain damage. I go mine 12 yrs ago."
"9+ year member, I'v been just fine with the UI,ever since it was announced that it would be what you had to use. It's just that, it doesn't have the level of detail the OG member site does. Launching from the UI is way better once you get used to it."
2009 was my starting year when i could only run short ovals a my computer couldnt manager more!
11 yrs here. Always found the websites user interface confounding. From a nostalgia perspective I’ll miss it. But I’m a UI guy now.
2009 👋
Member since ‘08. 🫡
Well there's members-ng.iracing.com which is basically the ui in a browser without the sim launching functionality 
"The iRacing companion app is pretty decent for this.  You can set it up to have ""favorite"" series."
"https://preview.redd.it/01doksvoywcc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7abd8fc5d46addace7c3ae7799aadf2431daa0c0

Companion app"
Remote desktop on your phone works pretty great. I've registered for league races on my phone lmao.
"Use the iRacing Week Planner website, it's my go-to. But I'm also bummed about losing the old site."
there’s an app for your phone
iPhone app is very useable
"Right. I make it home too late to register, but in time to race. This move to the UI ends my workday racing opportunity."
"24h of delaytona wasn't actually a website issue, it was a server issue. They fixed that separately from disabling web registration for special events.


I've been on the UI for several years now. The only thing it's missing is a way to see registration numbers by class for multiclass races."
Lucky you.
I do miss that... :(
"I have been a member since March 22, 2011. I started with LFS a little before that. I had kind of an idea what sim racing was, but I stumbled on a video on YouTube about LFS. It was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAvj0iY1Zig

I was instantly interested and researching sim racing. I started out with a logitech momo on LFS and NR2003. I upgraded to a G25, and eventually bit the bullet to sign up for iRacing. Now I own my own house, racing on a full rig, ultrawide monitor, VRS direction drive, fanatec pedals, and VR occasionally when I am up for it. I never forget where I came from though. Living in my mom's house, racing on a fat back monitor with my wheel clamped to the rickety desk."
"5/12/14 for me. From a little apartment in New Orleans with a G27 clamped to my desk and single 22"" screen to a full 80/20 rig, Fanatec DD setup, and Reverb G2 VR headset. My iRacing subscription actually outlasted my marriage to the woman I was with when I started :/"
"The website actually WORKED, and displayed ALL of the info you'd ask for, not just a chunk of it.


I still can't believe the apps result UI is so bad.

How hard is it to just dynamically scale like the website does?  The fuck?"
"It absolutely isn't.

The app UI is a cluttered mess that only displays a fraction of the information, and constantly bugs out and shows things like the wrong track for what's actually being run in the series.

All day yesterday it was showing talledega for races running on IIRC watkin's glen


The app objectively cannot be better than the website while it:

 *  Runs slower worse than the website and crashes more often
 *  Displays less information than the website in multiple areas including and most importantly, post race results
 *  Literaly displays incorrect information on the regular"
If you aren't already you could setup [Garage61](https://garage61.net/) and get details on all of _your_ laps recorded.
"I second changing to list, much easier to navigate that way!"
I just learned about favorite cars recently and using the search got a lot simpler instead of all those tags and scrolling through!
I just learned about favorite cars recently and using the search got a lot simpler instead of all those tags and scrolling through!
"This only helps SOME of the clutter, and does nothing to fix shit like Watkin's Glenn displaying as Talledega and all the bugs like that."
It's not in beta anymore. It's improved a lot! Give it some time.
"It's amazing how much of a malfunctioning clusterfuck it is.

Showing the wrong tracks in the race list?  The fuck?

Less than half the result info on the page?


Is this fucking 2003?"
Selling the rig instead of a 20 second Google search. Classic rection. How dare things change.
What? You are having sudden technical difficulties and you are ready to give up sim racing?
TV guide is in the UI now too.
"It's just soooo bad.

Unresponsive, sluggish, lacking critical information.

I've on MULTIPLE occassions loaded in to the wrong race because the ""REGISTERED > {JOIN} banner doesn't actually say what you're in, while you're looking at other series/sessions.


It's such a fucking failure of design.  Like Baby's First Launcher, from 2004.  They can't even dynamically scale tables and images.  FFS just use an iframe."
This is the answer. I only found out about it a few weeks ago and can't believe it isn't more widley advertised.
I can probably tolerate this
The app is actually surprisingly good for that.
"Yeah though the app UX is a bit odd sometimes - going back doesn't return you to the search page you were on, or the series page you were on most times, for example. 

You can't go back very far in race history, etc. either."
How did I not know this existed?
"If it was a server issue, then the UI would also have issues. It was an issue with how the website interfaced with the servers. The UI interfaces in a different more modern way."
"My journey is much the same, I even remember that video! Got a used G25 in 2010 for $100 bucks off a buddy that played midnight club. Started with LFS but was mainly drifting. 2011 I started iRacing for a couple years then only messing about with assetto periodically. Got back into iRacing in 2021 and only now am I retiring said G25 for 5k in rig+DD goodies. Was a kid then now I have my own wife, kid and mortgage. "
"I think the results UI is quite good. There's clear separation between elements, the layout is sensible, font color on IR/SR draws attention, good contrast between the font and the background, you can cycle between session types without scrolling. All of the info that most people are looking for is there and quickly visible.

What do you mean by ""dynamically scale""? Dynamically scale as in zooming, or ""dynamically scale"" as in resizing the window? 

If you're talking about zooming, that's a feature of the browser. Electron, which is the framework used to build the app, doesn't enable ctrl+scroll zooming by default, but it can be enabled. You'd be changing the zoom for everything though, and in that case, I think most people are fine with setting the 'UI Zoom' setting once and not thinking about it again.

For the latter, you can't resize the results itself, but you can resize the main UI window, which in-turn resizes the results. Why can't we resize *just* the results? Results open as a modal (those little pop-up boxes that open on websites) in the app, but they open as a new window on the website. You can have a resizable modal, but you'd typically only only make it resizable when the content that you're loading can potentially be larger than what the modal was designed for. The results modal already takes up nearly the entire screen. 

Should it open as a separate window? That's a design decision that has its own set of drawbacks, so it comes down to why *you're* trying to resize the results. Are you trying to keep them open while you go somewhere else in the app? In that case, would clicking 'View Results in Legacy Membersite' work for you? If not, and you feel that you have a strong case for why something should work differently, you can always submit a feature request."
">The website actually WORKED

Not according to people on the forums. Remember the times where newly minted players couldn’t join a race because the Daytona 500 was going on?"
"The website has some of the worst UX design I’ve ever seen. It was designed like how an engineer would design it - follow these logical set of steps and arrive at what you need, but you have to read a manual to get there. Designs with humans in mind don’t require that."
App has never crashed to me.
"The web results have a lap chart that shows incidents, connection issues, etc.


I don't think G61 does that? Pretty sure that's what he was talking about."
"It's still shit though.

The fact that it displays 1/2 of the post race info due to scaling problems is just pathetic."
Can you still withdraw and join another race so you can go back to back races?
Tolerate is a strong word here.
Prolly because you’ve been stuck on the website old man! /s
They only released it within the last year or so.  It isn't promoted much by iRacing.  It's pretty easy to use though and good for keeping an eye on upcoming races.  You can have it set up to remind you before a session too.
"In the incident being discussed, nobody was able to join, web or UI.

iRacing eventually tracked down the issue, and added a timeslot a few hours later."
"> What do you mean by ""dynamically scale""? Dynamically scale as in zooming, or ""dynamically scale"" as in resizing the window?

The latter.

There is an assload of wasted space, and so much less info presented than on the website UI.


Literally HALF of the results are presented, because all of the columns and rows have SO MUCH EMPTY SPACE, and the scaling just DOES NOT WORK like it does on the website,

You can literally just see ALL 26 RACERS on the website.  

On the UI you see about 10, and some of the results information just straight up is not there."
Looks like G61 just surfaces off tracks not all incidents but could likely be added.
"It's definitely not perfect, but the more they take devs away from the technical burden that is the membersite, the more they can work on improving the new UI."
"But it won't actually tell you what you're registered for, just that you're registered, so dice roll you are on the correct one!"
Yes you can!
">They only released it within the last year or so.

It's a bit older than that, but not by much"
"I'm just curious, is your monitor smaller than 27"" or is your resolution lower than 1440p? For a 24 driver grid, all rows on a 32"" 1440p are still visible up until I reduce the vertical height by about 1/4, and all columns are still visible until I reduce the horizontal width by about 1/3. What's wasted space to you is padding to others, which makes things easier to read.

I'm not bringing that up to tell you to buy a bigger / higher resolution monitor or to discredit you. I think the table was designed to look good for the range of displays that most people are using, and you happen to be outside of that range. I really do think that the devs listen to feedback, especially if enough people make the same suggestion. Send a message to support and say ""Hey, the session results table just doesn't fit well on an <x> inch <resolution> monitor. Here's a screenshot. Can you give us the option to view it full screen or maybe adjust the widths of the columns so that more columns fit?""

As for result info, the only thing that I don't see is Gross Club Points and an option to view individual laps. It would be cool if they added in an option to view the laps."
"I mean or they can just use what already worked and not force us to use a half baked and buggy launcher that was worse than their gen 2 TV guide UI.

Shout to them bringing that back though as an option for the race view.  To bad sorting is annoying as fuck though."
Can you explain how this works?
"Here’s a post about the app entering version 3 from three years ago. I think this is when the app became functionally similar to what we have today. Note that “iSchedule” was the name of the app before iRacing (very smartly) acquired it.

Edit: forgot the link, lol.

https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/ZRpFGDHZOL"
Register and join into a race then go back to the UI withdrawal from the race then just register for the next race assuming it's a half hour or less away.
"While you are in an active race session, you can open the UI and withdraw from your current session. As long as you don't leave your session before it ends, this will not count as a forfeit.

Now that you've withdrawn from your current session, you can register form the one you want to do next, while the simulator is still open. Once you exit your current session, you'll be able to join the new one you registered for."
I thought that was a forfeit button? And you take a hard DNF?
Long as the sim is still running laps will still be counted. It would only be once you close it that your results would then be considered finalized.
Have you installed the trading paints program?
"Make sure custom paint is selected on car in IRacing 

I downloaded the trading paint program and it automatically does everything needed when launching game which is more convenient easier"
"Yes I did install the program, I kept it running with everything checked. I even closed and restarted both Iracing and the TP program. Nothing seems to work."
I can't even check that. It's greyed out.
"Exit out and restart game it is finicky for me it took some time but it well upload that’s why I just downloaded the trading paint program any time you start racing it automatically updates instantly haven’t had issues with delay

I could of done it wrong but I don’t have patience’s the app makes it easy"
"Tried that multiple times, it wont work."
https://www.tradingpaints.com/page/Install
"Idk what you doing just make sure it’s right car etc sounds like your doing something wrong 

If you got the trading paint downloader on bottom right it says update paints I think and click that"
"Thanks for the help buddy. I did just that, but it didn't work. It might just be something regarding folder permissions, as I have read only access on iRacing folders. I'm thinking the app can't make changes bcause of this."
"So these are the settings of the trading paints program. I tried changing the paints to other cars and it will not work.

https://preview.redd.it/anxt05qwa2dc1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a487fc124a99fea93589f91f4bfd28f7ec46d66"
Idk never had a issue or did any of that so idk
"Yes, but are you sure, iracing itself probably won't launch if you only have read access.  Paints are stored in your documents\\iracing folder, not the iracing program folder, check permission in both spots."
"Do you leave it open and running while playing ? 

https://boxthislap.org/iracing-better-trading-paints/
Can try that 

But other than that idk 

Make sure custom paint is check 

Try restarting computer and have everything load up again"
"This might sound obvious, but you’re uploading the correct spec file to trading paints right?

When you’re designing your car paint and spec map in gimp or photoshop, you’re saving them as 2 separate files right?

The car paint scheme needs to be exported to your respective car’s paint folder as car_xxxxx.tga and the spec map needs to be exported as car_spec_xxxxx.tga. Once you successfully export both, you should open the iRacing “customize paint” UI, and it should render a new file called car_spec_xxxxx.MIP (not tga). It’s this MIP file that you have to upload in trading paints as the spec file.

(Unless you’re doing all the editing within trading paints itself, in which case I’m not sure how any of that works)"
"Well that’s the thing trading paints has those spec options in the car builder menu and that’s what I’ve been using.

https://preview.redd.it/zjnngu8is2dc1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c491a82441a74401465b16ee123fa4996a489f"
"Do you want to be competitive in multiplayer? I think that’s the main question to ask yourself. 

If so, iracing is the best hands down. If you are looking for AI races or mostly single player stuff or a more relaxing vibe, it’s probably not worth it (though the AI is good) and Assetto will be good for that."
I'm cheap to the point it negatively impacts my life and I think it's worth it. Theres no ABS assist in cars that don't have it. Also if your goal is F1 then it's a long way away and not very active. Super formulas have much more participation
This is like joining an onlyfans sub and asking if they recommend onlyfans.
"People have no problem paying for Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and whatever else all at the same time but lose their minds over iRacing.

iRacing is an entertainment service with world class physics, cars and tracks, real life racing potential, unmatched multiplayer capability, and constant updates and upgrades.

If you're interested in racing, already racing and want to stay sharp, or maybe you want to shoot for a real life seat, iRacing is hands down the best simulator on the market."
"There's plenty to experience for the cost of a 1-month sub since you have to start with the rookie content anyways. You could even potentially skim one of the occasional 3-month codes that people hand out on /r/simracing when they get it with a new gear purchase. I believe Matt Malone might still give out 3-month codes on his Discord server. 

Might as well experience it first-hand for minimal/no cost instead of getting second hand opinions."
"Assetto Corsa OG, is now on LFM, and it's a great alternative to iRacing at the moment. I'm only sticking with iRacing cause I already spended a lot of time and money on it, otherwise if I was starting, I would play AC instead."
You're gonna struggle at first coming from an arcade racer to a sim
"Just try it, if it infects you then don't look back."
"If you want to do competitive, multiplayer races, yes. If not, probably not. Honestly, I'd just try it though. Grab a one-month subscription and only race cars/tracks that are free and see how you like it."
"I'd suggest getting it if you're mainly interested in online lobbies which are available throughout the day (although some series are way more active than others). All series have races every 1 or 2 hours.

It's a bit annoying so long as you linger in rookie/D class series as they tend to be more chaotic (top class series are still chaotic more often than you'd think, don't get me wrong). But the best way to learn is to have tough races where you survive by skill or miracle sometimes, and you end up having to chase for most of the race. 

Someone else suggested to try the discount on your first month, I'd say even better wait for the new season (it starts in about 7 weeks from now) and get 3 months with the 40% new subscriber discount. 3 months cover a full season and rookie content is available for free, there are an open- and a closed-wheel rooke options. You will definitely find out if you like racing online. 

If you have been following iRacing content and know a bit about how iRacing seasons work, avoid signing up on week 13, it's a wreckfest as most series are not ranked and people tend to go crazy in that particular week.

As far as I'm concerned I saw what LFM (Low Fuel Motorspost) is offering on AC and ACC and it seems to be a VERY competitive and cheaper option than iRacing. I have already invested a lot of time, money and effort on iRacing so I will stick with it, I have a team whose people have now become my friends and I enjoy the special endurance events throughout the year, but if I ever decided to give up iRacing I'd probably be racing on LFM lobbies.



TL;DR iRacing is very good for online races throughout the day; be mindful as rookie races can be frustrating; try the 3 months discounted option for new subscribers; consider LFM as a cheaper alternative, they seem to have a good service."
"I'm back to iRacing now after leaving it for a few years, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone new right now, because of how crazy expensive it realistically will be to build a library of tracks from scratch. Which you will need to, unless you plan to stay in rookies forever.

I'd recommend the following plan:
- first, get a 1 month or 3 month discount code for new iRacing accounts and drive only rookies. Don't buy any content at all, just get a feel for how it is and how it works. I think Iracing rookies is a great starting point, because it pushes you to be competitive and to learn how to race others online, whereas in other sims it can be hard to find good races, and can be too easy to waste all the time hotlapping against the clock without actually improving yourself substantially, and without fully understanding what online racing is all about


- let the subscription lapse and then check out the free alternatives in Low Fuel Motorsport with Assetto Corsa and Assetto Corsa Competizione. You'll still have to buy the games, but they're much cheaper, plus AC is regularly massively discounted, keep an eye on Steam Sales you should be able to get the game with every single DLC for less than 10 dollars/euros. Competizione is a bit more expensive but still way more affordable than iRacing

Now after trying both options, you'll have a much better idea of whether paying the 300, 400, or 500 dollars/euros of a decent library of tracks, a few cars, and the yearly subscription in iRacing, is worth it for you.

Edit: nevermind I didn't realise you already had AC and ACC, I'd still recommend the same plan though. Go iRacing rookies, go LFM, compare and decide."
If you want the highest level of realism then iRacing is the only option. It’s a true simulator vs most others are just games
"I have all Assetto Corsa and ACC and Forza gt7 are more casual hop in and play which I do if I just want quick races hop into multiple cars tracks and race 

IRacing is like any other online multiplayer but people take it more seriously for the most part so I doesn’t feel any different as far as the fun and experience of racing 

But I racing is more of a commitment your not doing 5-10 lap sprint 

You doing over 25 laps or longer your taking 2 min to practice 5 min to qualify then do the race and then have to wait 30 min to a hour for next race or hop into another race that’s inbetween there isn’t no single player just practice on track by yourself 

So it’s a larger time commitment especially when learning a particular series and car if you have that time then it’s addicting if not and you want a quick play casual racing then 

Get the 1 month use the free content and see if you will like it that’s what I did but just don’t play one time and be like yea this sucks lol but in the time it’s been the most rewarding for me"
"Get a one month subscription. Plenty of content to see if you want to continue. Frustration will be in your future,  but thats the same as any online racing game."
Very much so
This is a better question for r/simracing than it is on a iracing subreddit….. if open wheel is your thing you would start off in the vee or formula ford. I chose the vee because it’s slow and I’m a noob.
"I came from F1 23, and although I enjoyed it, iRacing is just so much better. There’s a learning curve for sure but once you figure it out and get your first podium you’re hooked"
"Well yes of course, as will most people here. This is a sub dedicated to iracing, we are very much biased.

Better ask that question on r/simracing for a less biased response"
"If you have the money, yes
It is expensive but the competition in top splits are awesome"
After I got iracing I don't play any other racing game.
iRacing is for people who want realism for the sake of realism.
"New member Sub is discounted I believe, brilliant for a month of racing to help you make up your mind!
IMO, bandits will make an appearance on any service, but predominantly this is a service filled with like-minded racers, competing for similar goals."
"I’ve seen someone else say this and I agree…. IRacing is stupid expensive for a “game”.  But it is fairly cheap for a “hobby”.  If you are treating it as a game, maybe it isn’t for you.   It’s my hobby though.   Hobby’s are expensive but we are ok with that.   I play golf as another hobby.   $5,000 in clubs and accessories, $100 a round.   I also play pool and I’ve dumped thousands into that over the last 20 years."
I haven't tried AC but honestly the AI races aren't bad in iracing. I'm really enjoying myself and getting better at driving on the limit. The only thing I'd say is that iracing is a much better sim than a game. It'd really benefit from some basic quality of life features but it's not a deal breaker.
Super formula has more participation for good reason.  Perfect car.
"👆🏼👆🏼  perfect point re the subs.  
I always make a similar point that it’s a hobby. Plenty of hobbies you’ll spend the same, if not more."
"The sub wasn't my problem with iRacing... It's fairly priced. My problem is the price of content. I did the math and doing one full season of either Ferrari Fixed or GT4 would cost around $150 (at the time at least) up front... I get that tracks carry over from season to season and between series but that's just a harsh up front for something you don't even know if you'll like due to the lack of test drive time. 

But that's just me personally, not a dig at anyone who enjoys iRacing, just wanted to point out that the comparison to Netflix is slightly flawed as I'm not paying extra to watch anything there."
"Agreed. Just be careful, several of us started with a 3-month code to find out what it was about, and that was hundreds of $ ago :D"
"So there are no single player thi gs at all?

Im not really fond of online racing since F1 23 xD

But ill wait the few weeks and try it."
"Realism? WTF? You can crash, take out half the field and get a new car with a push of a button. How real is that?"
90% perfect. Wish it had tire compounds (just 2 would be cool) and the ability to refuel. But yes. Love it love it love it 
"The W13 is great, it’s a shame the rest of the population disagrees 💀"
"Iracing has been by far the cheapest ""adult"" hobby I have gotten interested in, r/c racing cost every time you drive, bikes need maintenance and upgrades, real cars, don't even look at receipts!"
"It’s definitely more expensive at first. I’ve spent a good 2 grand on content over 4 and a half years on the service. But now I’m at a point where I’m only paying the sub because I own a ton of tracks and cars. Its rare that a series I run is running a track I down own unless it’s a new track added to the service. 

But yeah it’s definitely a bigger investment initially but gets cheaper over time."
"You're right, the price of content does add up and yet it's still significantly cheaper than doing it in real life.

That's the way I look at it anyways, I sold my race, car and everything else because of how unbelievably expensive it was even just at the time NASA PTE level.

For me all the extra content is 100% worth it because it's mine for life, cheaper than doing the real thing, and I can wear my warm fluffy socks when I'm crashing out at Road America 😂"
">one full season of either Ferrari Fixed or GT4 would cost around $150

In hobby terms, it's not that bad...here's some sports comparisons:

\- less than two weekend rounds of golf

\- one table tennis season

\- 3 tennis seasons

\- cheaper than a bowling league

Plus, it becomes cheaper over time."
"No career, but you can have AI races.
Online racing in lobbies v what you’ll find in iRacing is completely different. 
Everyone has their iRating to increase and their safety rating to protect. It gives a sense of accountability.
Also, it isn’t a 4/5 lap race and straight into the next. It’s 1 an hour in the best scenario. People prepare and take care."
"I think you need to understand that online racing in F1 23 or other vs iRacing isn't even a close comparison in how people act. Those who intentionally wreck or drive wreckless get reported and banned/vacations as needed, and people who join (99% of the time, sometimes there are lots of silly/fun/wacky leagues, series, etc) are people who want to RACE, not use people as pinballs to move to the front. Sometimes people drive that way, but they don't last long, and usually can be spotted a mile away in order to avoid em ;)"
"I'd say it would be a huge waste of money to get iRacing for single player racing as the game was created with the goal of introducing good online racing. Online racing on iRacing is not as bad as what I have seen on AC or ACC, you might end up enjoying it, it's not even remotely comparable to what you have seen on F123 online lobbies.

I'd say if what you're after is no-fuss single player racing I'd suggest ACC or Automobilista 2. ACC is only GT3 and GT4 racing, AMS2 has more options in terms of cars and tracks I believe.

If you are willing to spend a bit of time modding and troubleshooting things then the OG Assetto Corsa is a good option."
"Sure, honestly a ridiculous argument. But we can build a setup for a car on the sim that will be within .2S of the cars performance in real life. So yeah I would say it’s pretty realistic."
"As a golfer, it’s definitely cheaper than that as well. 

Even playing football once a week comes to ~£30 a month for 4/5 hours entertainment"
RC is a great hobby but it's so damn expensive. I've probably spent at least 2 or 3k on it but I still love it.
"I didn't even know you could spend 2k for content, good to know. I still will always love iracing though! It's like an addiction"
"Yeah, for sure, and for me, I couldn't justify that up front cost. I know you can ease into it by not doing a full season in whatever series you wanna get into immediately but that's just not what I wanted to do. Luckily I've been able to get my fix since Race Control was launched for rF2 :)"
If your goal is an app that's cheaper than real life... Kerbal Space is the game for you.
"Oh, for sure, when comparing it to taking a car to a real track it's a complete no-brainer. But that's also just not a valid comparison for me, as that's not something I'd ever do :)"
"Well i am pretty inexperienced with all that myself as i drive very casually with driving line and abs on.

So I will need to learn how to tail correctly or dive correctly before i then get a vacation myself xD"
A green fee in my country is nowdays almost worth 1 year of iracing😭😂
">I didn't even know you could spend 2k for content,

Just don't ever do the math on what you've spent and you're golden."
If you check your account page it’ll show you how much you’ve spent. I was shocked when I first saw it but I love iRacing. It’s my favorite hobby.
Gives you a few months to save up for when MSG goes under and It gets shut down. 
Stats? Preferred car?
Any really. I've put in a lot of laps in them all.
"And your stats? IR/SR?

Don't make us pull this info out of you."
Oh shit. Overlooked that part. I'm between 1.5k and 2k  b right now.

"Sorry for the late reply, I’ll give that a shot tomorrow. Hopefully it does the job! Thanks for the info!"
Seems like it still isn’t working…
"I’m pretty new to iracing but had a fellow driver take me around Laguna Seca last week and show me all the brake points in a live practice session and it was awesome. There are very welcoming people in this community. Sucks to hear about this kinda stuff, especially as a newbie."
Protest it under competition issue
we talking bout practice 
"Not that I’m yelling at people in practice but shouldn’t people be “learning” the track in a test session where they don’t interfere with people actually trying to practice. 
I mean practice in the sense of tuning a setup, practicing overtakes, and practicing being overtaken in a “race” setting. 
In my opinion learning a track is for solo sessions where someone doesn’t have the ability to “ruin” someone’s actual practice."
"What’s ludicrous is drivers thinking 1 short practice session is appropriate before entering a race on track they’ve never done. 

Some are even joining 5 minutes before a race session starts with the whole ‘it’s my first time on this track any advice’

I have replied ‘maybe learn it before racing’.

I can understand the frustration. If someone is constantly spinning in practice they are likely to cause a hazard to you sometime during the race, usually when you’re lapping them. 

I’m all for being welcoming but people need to be able cut at least 20 clean laps before entering a race.

If you are not at the point of being able to do this then you have no business racing and are just going to ruin the experience for everyone else. 

Whether you should be doing this in a test drive or in an official practice session is debatable. I think at least a few sessions in test drive should be done first

Secondly most of us don’t have enough time to race as much as we want to. When I’m in a practice server I am there for a reason, to get my eye in and my set up fine tuned. I’m not there to watch and help others. Harsh as it sounds I’m there to race not to socialise.

If you want help ask or put a video up here."
Iracing needs to teach new drivers about practice groups and tell them to join a unpopulated practice group when learning a track. or to run a solo session till they are safe. Joining a populated server and crashing every 2nd corner is disrespectful IMO. You are showing no regards to other people whos time is just as valuable as yours.
"Depends;

Are we talking “I’m not fast but I’m working on it”, or “Dang, which way do I go up here? Oh shit, that was my braking marker. Guess I’ll use this other cars brakes.”"
"Whilst I wont mute the entire voice chat, I mute the individual drivers shit talking as soon as it starts. It absolutely pisses me off people getting all heated on the mic and especially on practice servers"
"Use offline practice to learn the track. Practice servers are for the final practice with race-accurate conditions, not for missing your brake point every corner and being a pain for everyone else.

If you want to follow another car to learn the line, setup AI practice, they will forgive every mistake"
"It’s practice so at the end of the day whatever. But when there’s a test drive available that you can configure to your liking, why join a public session to learn a track? There’s no need to although you’re entitled to, but why would you want to?"
You must be a very unlucky person.  I race in 14 different series and have never witnessed this.  But I can fully understand how frustrating it could be if someone ruins your official practice session by constantly causing crashes and issues because they should clearly be in a solo lobby learning the basics.
"The toxic people suck. Still, they sort of have a point. You are being a tad bit inconsiderate if you join an official practice session in your first time driving car or learning a track. Too many people join sessions having no clue the way round the track and goof up the actual practice happening. I don't see an issue with this in rookies, but at D and up you should know better."
"I do agree with you, but it also depends on the type of accidents they’re causing. Yesterday I was testing setups on Daytona and there were a bunch of brand new C level guys trying to overtake in t1, t2 with low fuel. Pushing people of out of their way. Those people should leave, not everyone in practice sees it as a game and might be working on something."
Just mute em man. It’s much more peaceful
"Like others have said, if you are 10 seconds or something off the pace, you should not join a public practice session, but use test drive. It doesn't justify receiving abuse, but hoarding the racing line driving 40km/h slower than everyone else is inconsiderate."
"I struggle to imagine being such an inconsiderate fucking loser to think that my learning the track for the first time is more important than everyone else's goals in a practice session.

iRacing has multiple practice groups per session for you to be the mobile chicane you always dreamed of. Drivers *are* justified in their frustration if they're trying to practice and get faster, and a dumbass who doesn't know where the next corner is is in their way lap-after-lap.

We're not better than this. I want these people bullied out of my practice groups."
"Alot of the new “covid and later” drivers are the worst..  they bring their “console gaming” toxicity and its embarrassing..  theres too many of those drivers and I hate it, but money talks to iracing and they wont do alot about it.

People are there to practice, and I applaud the new driver for doing that..  sometimes it best to just mute the chat and focus on your own race"
Imagine unironically chatting with the people you play with in 1947+however many years its been since then.
"I'm not agree with these toxic comments, but honestly, if you are learning a track, you should go on private sessions. When you are on a public lobby, you know that you may find people slower than you, but actually racing. A guy who is constantly erratic on their driving is annoying because you can't actually practice, nor hotlap, or race situations. It's ok to be slow. The problem is when you are dangerous."
"I tend to practice in test drive until i can hold it together for 20 minutes, then go do the practice sessions to compare/improve pace. I can understand someone being frustrated if they're trying to practice and theres guys coming off the track, causing incidents and getting in the way. 

toxicity or inconsideration, I guess it depends which side of the coin you are."
"I find the difference between oval (especially Super Speedway) and road to be night and day. Practice or race.

SS people will be chatting away, working together, general chatter ""hey buddy, nice of you to join us!"", ""see you in the race, good luck!"".

Road it's silent until someone makes an error ""fuck you, asshole, I'm reporting you!"" etc

I would suggest it's better to turn your first ever laps of a circuit in a solo test drive, just to avoid any silly errors that affect other people, but apart from that everyone should take the opportunity to learn in practice. It's the best place to improve race craft, make it 3 wide and see what happens, make a lunge and see if you can make it stick, this sort of thing. If you want to hot lap you can do it solo, or if someone tries to race then back off and make a gap."
"It's definitely changed over the last 10 years in that regard.  People have always had outbursts, but they seem more vile and much longer now.  How someone can go on and on about something for lap after lap is beyond me. 

I have mute mapped, so I can turn that off, or you can mute comms completely.

You're a paying customer just like they are.  Their IR doesn't give them any special power.  Practice and ignore them or report abuse."
"Man, I’m sorry you’ve had this experience. I’m a new driver and I’ve jumped into several of the “live” practice servers and never had a bad experience. I try to be courteous and pay attention to my surroundings, but I’m sure I’ve also still managed to mess up some other people’s laps."
Toxic console players moving to iracing
"Ya, a lot of people help me same way. I love iracing bc of it."
![gif](giphy|8vkEKXvnXkyCZx8w6b|downsized)
"No, they shouldn't. If they want to practice in a live server they're fully entitled to. Maybe those who get pissy about people practicing in a practice server are the ones who should be doing things in private offline sessions, until they can learn to tolerate the existence of others at different levels."
"I get what you’re saying here but the best way to learn is with live people on the track. That’s where you learn multiple things at once. How to race the track before you race others, and as well about how to give and take around others..aka Race craft."
"I think you're onto something here. IRL if stewards saw a participant having 5 offs in 5 practice laps I think they'd be like ""errr, no"".

I'd like to see iRacing make improvements here."
"I've only ever learned new tracks in public practice sessions. It's absolutely possible to do this without destroying others practice session at the same time. You just have to have some common sense. It even helps to learn a track faster. If a faster car comes up on me, I just let them pass. Then I follow them for as long as I can in order to learn their line/braking points. I don't try to race bumper to bumper until I'm completely comfortable with the track and braking points."
"Cut 20 clean laps before racing? I race in SOF 2.2-2.5 and am slow as shite compared to the competition because 2-3k iR folks cant do two laps before having a fokking seizure and killing 1/5 of the field. I end up qualifying last and finishing 6-8th and bump my iR up further simply by not driving like a twat. Frustrating because I don’t belong in that sof but also not gonna sandbag things 

Gotta call bullshit on your “cut 20 clean laps” line. If that were the case 99% of all races wouldn’t go official. 

I know the hardcore speds will lose it but iracing is a game. The cars are fake, the odds of you becoming a real racing driver is about the same as winning the lottery and most folks just want to have fun. I get the “try to be courteous” angle, it’s just called being a good person but for goodness sake don’t take yourselves so seriously. If you get killed just be happy your Ferrari is fake and easily replaced. It’s also more reliable than a real one anyways."
ill run a race with less clean laps then dirty laps and still finish way better than 99% of those with all clean laps. Clean laps mean nothing unless by clean you mean... not wrecking.
"Practice sessions are very ok for new drivers. It is practice. As long as they don't deliberately take out people it is good training. Situational awareness, looking at the relative or surrounding when you spin. Learn different lines. You learn allot more when in a populated practice than a solo practice."
"I'm new and always choose a desperate group on my own in practice sessions so I don't wreck others via my own stupidity.


I always choose group13 as no one has ever entered while I've been on track"
"Not quite true, it's just down to how they practice. If you approach more like irl, so while trying hard to keep the car in one piece and using your brain when others are around you, it isn't a problem that you don't know or car or track. But yeah when your prefered method of figuring out a track includes overdriving hard and crashing until you find the limit then maybe this is best done offline."
"Now this is completely different. Those who come in acting, for lack of better terms, stupid …absolutely. No time nor place for that in iRacing. This is not wreckfest or demo derby. Over the course of the 13yrs I’ve been in iRacing and 5+ on other sims in a league environment the past week and a half is when I’ve noticed the worst coming out of folks. It’s the big “d” mentality that is the worst. 

Points made that are definitely agreed with:

-Don’t come into open practice being intentionally disruptive (not even trying to practice to learn but rather “there to have your fun wrecking or doing donuts)

-Absolutely utilize the Test sessions to get the feel for a track/car combo. I do agree that you should not be coming in completely wet behind the ears into a practice 

-Once you are in a practice and if you’re struggling, pipe up, ask for help there are plenty of decent drivers that would rather help you than to have you be a risk on track ..don’t be too proud to say “I’m struggling here, can someone help me with a tip on what I’m doing wrong here?” I have personally pulled someone having a “struggle” into an empty practice group and seen them improve drastically. Sometimes all that’s needed is changing how you’re entering a corner or what gear you’re using in a specific section 

-If you’re running well and see someone struggling offer some valid but helpful tips/criticism DONT chide them, we all start somewhere 

-As for those of us who have a higher license (SR+IR) if we select to participate in specifically a rookie class event and we are in practice with them, remember you where there once. Yes, I do still enjoy going into some of the other classes although I have my A on oval and B on road. Some of those races can be fun and extremely clean and competitive."
All you down votes are proving my point lol
"You seem to be confusing ""practising"" and ""learning"" a track.  Completely different things."
"you didnt read or comprehend what he said. He wasn't talking about whether its allowed or not allowed. Hes basically getting at its common courtesy to not share the track with people who can actually run laps when you can't make it 2 corners without wrecking yourself and others.

the real solution is iracing actually having some training and telling new drivers who are learning to select an unpopulated practice group. then when they are feeling better, they can move to the main group."
This is true. But you atleast need to know the layout and have some references for braking and turning points.
"if you are a significant danger to others, you should do a solo session or join an unpopulated group within the practice sessions until you are safe enough to not ruin other peoples practice sessions.

i would be more than slightly annoyed if i am 15 laps into a practice run and some new guy who has never touched this car/track combo comes in an is wrecking every 2nd corner and taking people with them. IMO its slightly disrespectful.  you dont respect other peoples time enough to put in the effort by yourself so that you aren't negatively affecting other peoples races/practices."
"You don’t need to be on the track with others to learn the track layout. I agree with others on this, until you know the track layout, do private sessions. It’s just the courteous thing to do. 

Once you know the track layout and have an okay idea of the proper lines, then sure, join practice sessions with others and start refining your lines and optimizing lap times."
"Laps without spinning or wrecking someone. 

…I’m not sure what you mean by dirty laps though. Unless you are taking one hand off the wheel and using it for something else"
You can also do a test session to learn the track.
"No, I read and understood. And I disagreed. It's very gatekeeperish behaviour (at best) to be annoyed at people learning the track in practice sessions. And people who are bothered by that have the option to jump into a different group, or practice and setup tweak offline. Not that hard to understand."
"a ""clean"" lap is very commonly used within the iracing community as a lap that you didnt get an off track/wall contact on. a dirty lap is the opposite"
Now that's a challenge!
...with active reset it makes it even easier!
Why would you learn a track in an open session? It makes things more difficult when you have to handle trafic. Or maybe you are the one having zero consideration for others and don't care for the people around you?
"I'm fairly new to iRacing, coming up on 1 year in march, and don't know about active reset. Is that only available in a certain practice session or test drive?"
"I actually like to do that. It's great to follow faster drivers so you can find braking points, lines etc. 

However, I always realize in the first 2-3 laps I will be a couple of seconds slower of course, and brake much too early often. So I watch my mirrors closely and let anyone I can see pass. 

Only thing annoying is when you go high speed and some idiot sticks his nose in your gearbox. Then you move aside to let them pass but they just move with you because ""slipstreaming before epic overtake!"". No way to let them pass. Corner ahead. You brake earlier aaaaaand bam, unavoidable crash. Don't race cars in practice... Live and let live."
Test.  Search YouTube for iracing active reset.
This reminds me of watching Davey Allison doing this right in front of me at Pocono when I was a kid.
too soon
That would be fun in VR

I believe it depends on the level of ban. I think it varies and can be limited to only official sessions all the way up to a total ban. I imagine if your teammate can enter a hosted session they can enter your league race.
Is your partner driving a GTP with a Ferrari livery by chance?
"Your account will be suspended from participating in Official Multiplayer Sessions (Racing & Qualifying). You may continue to participate in Open Practices, Time Trials, Hosted, AI and Testing sessions. The penalty starts today and lasts for duration of 1 Week.  

This main Part and where we are confused. But we'll try that thanks"
"“You may continue to participate in…**Hosted**”

League sessions are just more organized versions of hosted sessions"
Was he driving the Mach 6? 🤣
I raced them on Monday. GR86
"I raced him yesterday, bumped me off the track, but he did say sorry and I got by him later on haha"
"I know this probably doesn't mean much to some, but I finally got my first actual oval win last night. I just started racing ovals last week and my first win was a result of many crashes that I escaped, so I didn't count that as a win.

However, this race was a different story. Led the entire race in first, no incidents, felt so satisfying. Just thought I'd share. I also wanted to show off my Stacker2 livery.

Have a good day!"
"Grats, dont shy away from the hard tracks, dover , darlington, etc. They will make you a drastically better driver. And when you go to the easier tracks, it'll be a good day lm"
"Got my first pole position and win in the same race the other day, felt so good. 
Congratulations on your win!"
Dude!!!  Congrats man!  Now the next one should be easier!   Go get #2!
Anytime you make it over the start finish on a super speedway clean is a minor fucking miracle.
"Is everyone just running trading paints now?

is that why there are so many white cars in class c and higher these days?"
Congrats! Good to celebrate.
Good stuff
"Congrats!!! As a road racer who grew up watching NASCAR with my dad, I naturally love Oval racing and understand the flow of it. But making it happen with everyone around you is a totally different ballgame. Hoping one day once I take a road break and really hop into ovals I get that adrenaline rush of just running away with it like that. I bet that feels amazing."
Congrats brother!
"Surviving on super speedways is no small feat, you’ll learn that soon. Congrats on joining the club!!!"
"Yeah, I've never even thought about trying oval before last week. Now I'm thinking of signing up for a oval league lol"
Feels so satisfying to hold onto it
Thanks man!
I went from 22nd to 5th with 0X at Daytona earlier - I felt like I won the lottery lol
Amen to that lmao
"Pretty sure majority of people been ""only running trading paints"" for many years."
Yes. I made this livery on Trading Paint's web designer
Thank you!
Thanks man!
"thats been my deal for 10 years (aside from a 2 year stint with an indycar e team) , have fun with it. its super hard to get away from people and some of those tracks so it makes it easier to get into issues.  


im suddenly finding my self wanting to open wheel road race more. personally . i think im just tried of having to deal with 5 guys constantly on your ass.  road racing some what seems like i can get away from most drivers and get a rhythm going."
That's exactly how it feels
"You see, that's what I actually like about ovals. The pack racing feels awesome and much more strategy is used IMO. On road courses, you just drive and get ahead unless you get into a decent battle. You always have people near you on an oval and it's just so different for me. I love being able to inspect people's liveries while doing 200 mph in VR lmao"
"i thought the same but after 10 years im sick of it lol, ive always been a ""in the groove or rhythm"" kind of racer so i tend to do better when we spread out and i dont gotta worry about guys hounding me every 2 seconds."
When did you start celebrating? All cars must cross the line or dnf on a timer before the sim stops giving you penalties. Was someone wrecked off the track but not towed?
"Did the remaining time counter in the F1 black box tick over into the 15 minutes countdown? If it didn't, penalties and incidents are still active."
"You got a 2x for loss of control by doing the donuts.  This caused you to go over the incident limit and gave you the black flag and penalty.

Post the results page including the incident count.

Also it's Indy fixed not open."
"Are you absolutely sure that you actually finished the race?

Results shows, that you ran 64 laps which would make sense with that penalty. But lap 64th took you 54 seconds to complete. Which would match pace of you lap ""after checkered""."
Did you do cool down lap? Would have given you time to do it!!
You should do donuts after everyone has crossed the finish line. Otherwise it may be treated as driving the wrong direction which causes the black flag. It's in the sporting code.
"that may have happened. i finished the last green flag lap, and then completed an additional lap at 70% pace. probably 40 seconds or so after the checkered, usually the CC will tell me when all other cars have cleared ""the race is over, bring it on in"", which i heard. but there was a slow car in turn 1 on my 66th lap that i didn't see at the s/f later, who may have been tail of the lead lap with an inoperable car."
I guess not. I never use f1 but I will now I guess. 
"Good call out it was fixed not sure why I said open  https://us.v-cdn.net/6034148/uploads/C3DAGHHA7M4L/wut.png


The 2x was the only incident I got all race"
"Yeah, I'll put the replay on YouTube or something later and share"
"Yep, cruised around in 4th gear "
Yeah I did I cooldown lap and figured everyone else was done. Apparently not
"In that case then I think you just got massively unlucky there. The timer is 2-3 mins-ish so if that car hadn't crossed, scoring was still in effect. 

Maybe what CC said to you was part of the ""you won"" trigger, or one for approaching pitroad."
"You mean white flag, right? 

The last green flag lap is the second last lap."
I'd report it to iracing. Go to the forums under Report a Problem.
"You mean you completed the whole lap, crossed the S/F for the 2nd time and still got it?"
"The last lap is also green unless it's under yellow. I ran an additional cool down lap, lap 66/65 before spinning on the front"
"Yes. I took the checkered, continued around the track, passed one car that was stopped in turn one and then spun intentionally on the front by the flag stand. 


I didn't realize the car in turn 1 still needed to finish the white flag lap. He had an inoperable car with a meatball but was attempting to finish the race."

It's always posted on the thread for the special event"
Weird. From what I remember the Vee is very prone to lift-off-oversteer.
How fast are you going when you try to induce oversteer? If you're going too slow you probably won't break the rears loose. Try going faster. Also STUDY
"Okay I wasn't going fast enough to really see any effect. 


Funny enough I spun out when trying to turn via the brake, and realized it was because I had applied too much weight to the front, which means less grip was available at the rear, so they give out and you spin. It's all about the weight lol

It's making so much sense, now I just have to apply it."
1600 is less prone to off throttle oversteer. The vee will basically oversteer if you looks at it wrong though. Make sure you’re going fast enough.
"So, you're on the skid pad, and when you lift the throttle, you don't notice that you turn in more than before?"
"Somewhat unrelated but using that lift off oversteer can help get you super fast with the vee and the F4, tsukuba was a good track to practice that on"
I've been trying to do the same thing with the Porsche 911 gt3 cup. I have abs and tcs off but the only time I can get any over steer is when I immediately load in with a new car and cold tires. Otherwise once I get going I can't seem to cause trailing throttle oversteer or power oversteer no matter what I do.
"Turning in more when you lift off is technically oversteer.

The point of the exercise if I'm not mistaken is showing you how to steer with the throttle. 

Next will be how to steer with the brake."
"Higher revs will also result in more engine braking when you lift, maybe down shift?"
"Do that in second gear, with less steering angle. Also as someone pointed out, after a few laps doing circles, tires warm up. If you are constantly under steering, you are heating up the fronts, which effectively get more grip than the rears, which will make the car under steer even more."
The vee is literally driven on the throttle.
"Oulton park turn 3 is a good one, go round there and completely lift off see what happens"
Yea it definitely is
I'm gonna try going faster and seeing what happens.
Extremely so in my experience lol
"Hahaha I'm studying! But thank you I needed the laugh. 

Also I'm in like 2nd or 3rd gear nearly at shift point. I want to say 30 or 40m line."
"I was just banging my head on this exercise in the FF 1600 last week. 

During maintenance I jumped in Porsche and it was a lot easier to induce oversteer with the throttle :) 

In my noob opinion I find the big thing is learning to get yourself in a gentle oversteer with trail braking to get the corner rotation.

It is A LOT of fun.

This week's track at Charlotte Motor Speedway is a great one to practice it on because the entire course is a pile of decently aggressive turns. 

You can also make use of active reset on a track like T1 of limerock -- just barrel into it over and over trying to nail rotation going into the right hand double apex turn."
"No I do, but in the video the back would get lose and would have to recover. He was essentially drifting the car by releasing the throttle, I don't get any release from the rear. Which to me means it's speed related, I'm just going too slow or something. 

But yeah I guess that would be oversteer then right, but then why was it in the video the back gets lose and he has to recover."
"Yeah I'm just now realizing that. Unfortunately I spent all week driving the F4 on Tsukuba. Which was it's own educational lesson in its own.

Oh duh just realized you said F4. Yeah I just don't have enough foot control yet to pull it off well, I'll keep trying tho"
"Are you turning the wheel too much?
You need to be near the limit of grip on the rear tires before lifting to induce oversteer. If you’re understeering you might be far below the limit of the rears to break traction by lifting."
The default brake bias is too far forward (but that isn't your problem). Try moving it to like 42.5% and being gentler with the brakes
"Yeah you're right, I wasn't making that connection. 

Where I'm confused is why his back end would lose traction, and I'm not. I do get more turn in, but no loss of traction in the rear where I then have to recover like he was."
"I think I just wasn't going fast enough, I'm trying it right now going much faster and the effect is much more noticeable.

I never really thought about it like that tho, makes sense."
"Really good point, never thought about it like that but makes total sense."
"Yeah I know, I was just being stupid last night lol. I turn it with the the throttle all the time on the track, like what.. I think its t2 at Lime is an awesome example I think of throttle released oversteer."
try rudskogen. In rookies you can see the prominent corner for that off throttle oversteer :D

You’re talking about oversteer on throttle. OP is talking about lift-off oversteer. 2 very different things.
">  He was essentially drifting the car by releasing the throttle, I don't get any release from the rear.

In the Skippy? The Skippy normally plows on lift off. Try changing the ARB to 1 to get it to do that.

Normally you have to stab the brake to get the Skippy to turn in"
"That is probably why, I’m definitely understeering. I think I’m currently using the baseline setup so maybe that is why.
Is there a setup you would recommend?"
"Im not touching the brakes, I’m trying to induce oversteer with just the throttle on the skid pad"
What kind of throttle pedal do you have? If your pedal doesn't have a strong enough spring to quickly decelerate the engine then you wont be able to upset the rear enough.
"Wait, the brake is involved? Isn't that just trail braking? I thought it was purely throttle related. He would release the throttle and the cars rear would break lose. I'm so confused now lol"
"Oh. Uh. It depends on a few factors but here's a general tip: the porsche will bias towards understeer when driven gently and oversteer when driven roughly. If you're at the limit of your tires while steady-state cornering and then get on the gas, your fronts will probably just get overwhelmed. Throttle oversteer is not meant to act in a vacuum. It's just one tool in your box. It's meant to work in conjunction with trail braking, neutral steering etc."
G920. Throttle spring is default and I mapped the clutch to the brake and swapped the springs.
[deleted]
That makes sense. I’m starting to think then maybe this just isn’t the right car to practice this with haha
">But yeah. Basically if you hit the gas a little early in a corner and let off the throttle, the car should give you a snap of oversteer.

Gas and throttle pedal are the same thing, you cannot hit it early and lift off at the same time."
"FYI, if you dont want your name shared/associated with your reddit account.... use a throwaway or just dont post anything with any race info. the above info is enough to link your name to your reddit account in 30s."
It was always going to happen. Personally i already do most things via the ui and the only things i really did through the website i can still do
Only downside is no PayPal on the UI store last I tried.
"I’ve been subscribed for years and have never once used the website beyond buying content, which is now much easier and integrated with the ui client. I’d be surprised if most of the player base wasn’t the same way."
UI was introduced years ago and it was always going to replace the website completely just a matter of time.  iRacing was pretty clear on that but kept the website going for the older members to transition eventually.  UI works great only downside is less detail on the race result reports I think.
"Old enough to know when it was only the website. 

Very happy with the UI and glad that’s the direction they are going."
"I like the new UI.

What makes you hate it so much??  Would you racther it looks like it is from trhe XP era or whatever.

As far as refreshes go, this is a good one."
"I'm very new but have been doing everything via the UI, so I don't care. 


Frankly, if I'm running a piece of software like a simulator, a launcher makes way more sense to me than a website. "
I hated the UI when I first used it but once I figured out how to filter it to only series and cars I actually run it was way better.   Just don’t like the lack of PayPal in the store.
"The website is built on web technology from mid-2000s. The UX is terrible, the content has accessibility issues, and the information architecture needs a complete overhaul. Happy they’re moving on. Cheers."
"We've known about this happening for like.. 7 years? 

And when it was only the website you'd watch the *entire* service go down if one series got way too popular on a single day. Nothing quite like new rookie drivers not being able to even log in just cause a special event was happening. Not to mention the registration roullete. 

Good riddance. Be forced to use the more effective and load balanced UI."
Good riddance.
I've been on for 4 years and have never used the website for registering for sessions. I thought that part of it had been shut down a year ago.
"Took me forever to force myself to use the UI instead of the website, but it's for the better now that I am familiar with it. 

The forum though...RIP."
"The website was horrible performance-wise. Glad to ditch it. Did not enjoy its UX as it felt unwieldy.


The UI’s decent enough, though I wish there were more customization options."
I have the UI linked to my Stream Deck for simple push and play. I've tried playing through the website once and the overall game play was the same but I didn't like the extra steps. It feels more natural using the UI... whatever that means 😁
You can view some additional race statistics via the site that i have not seen in the UI.. like individual lap times.. i think there is something else too but cant recall
I joined in 2022 so the UI is all I know. The website confuses me since I’ve never used it really.
I still like the website though because it’s layout and design reminded me so much of like internet in 2008
Have used the website since ‘18. Today is a sad day
I have raced on and off for 5 years and idk that I’ve ever really used the website at all.
Does anyone know how to look up driver profiles now?  I've never done it in the UI.
"Good, now they don't have to spend resources supporting both platforms. The UI app is just a website inside the electron wrapper anyway so the same developers can now focus on improving that."
All I cared about was having access to my certificates. I have been using the UI 99.9% of the time since I got on the service at the end of 2019.
It makes sense on so many levels. I’m good with it
No need for a website now as far as I can tell... the app is now all I need.
"Good, the website is dated. Time for change"
Imho the UI is much better and clearer
Its about time. We are no longer in the 1980s. Lets move forward with the UI interface.
I am a Mac guy mostly so I don’t like it but I also respect they need to stop doing double effort to have more time to do other more important stuff.
"It’s totally fine, UI works well. The only thing I miss was the visualization of the upcoming schedule. It was nice to be able to look a couple hours out and visualize it rather than just looking at times alone."
They have been telling us this for 3 years. I prefer the UI and wish they would move everything to the UI. The website is very dated.
"Honestly it sucks. I think the UI is pretty clunky for a lot of things (although it is much better for finding and joining races).

Plus we have lost the ability to with one click start a previous test or race session in VRS."
There’s a website?
I like the read the forums on my phone. I’m guessing that’s not something I can do with the UI on my iPhone.   So there’s that
I guess im the minority here. But to me the website is much faster than the UI. Its a shame they arent keeping both. Ill probably crash the sim trying to load it up now.
Shit have they? That sucks :(  the webpage is far superior to the UI. The UI is bloody awful
"The UI gives me issues and I have a damn good gaming computer, but it's laggy."
I miss the old forums but I like the new UI
It was inevitable. I like the UI anyway so I don’t care.
"The only bad thing is that apparently I can’t pay with paypal in the UI, the only downside yet"
The UI has become pretty good.  Been using it for the past year after using the website for 8 years before that.
"People have known this was gonna happen at some point for years. If they haven't swapped and are upsetti about it, then thats on them. lol"
Do u still download the game from the web or will that be ui now
"The website is miles better for stats, but otherwise the UI is great.  It was clunky when it first released but very much improved.  Just give me stats equivalent to the website and I’m happy."
"I don't like it, but mainly because when I now make a [track walk](https://irtrackwalk.com), I need to make it in one go and can't use images from other layouts to merge one together, since the weather seed is always different and the clouds always a bit different when starting a session from the UI.

Maybe in the future with #rain #soon we can put in a custom seed."
Didn't know the members website did anything
Can you still filter stats and results like the site
"I only used the site to buy new content. Then when i run the update the new content is installed. 

So now are we going to have to update iracing, then purchase content, then update again ? 

Not that it would take much more time, but I found legacy method more convenient."
okay? as it should
"The UI used to be really bad, today it's OK and I prefer to use it over the site."
Hopefully that frees up some development cycles for cool new features!
"I don't care at all, apparently it was so out of date it causes lots of issues. A big reason why the Daytona 24 crashed a few years ago IIRC."
Disappointed I can't check the schedule on the website while I'm at work anymore
TBH ive never used the webpage.
There's a UI?? I've used the website since 2008....what is going on?!
if you still used the website you're the iRacing version of a boomer. it's like my Dad still owning a flip phone.
the UI is far more convenient
The only thing the old website was useful for was looking at results. The UI is missing a ton of features and you can’t fucking filter by race only.
Is there any way on the UI to see your season participation numbers?
"The amount of times I joined what I thought was a race session in the UI, only to watch everyone leave and join the race while I stay in the practice session by myself wondering what happened…."
So long as PayPal gets added as a payment method in the UI... I don't want to store my credit card details there.
Made it kinda annoying checking what series are racing where from my non sim pc
As long as I can still time trial somehow I don't mind. I think it's the only thing I've not found or done in the new UI
"I’ve been on iRacing for about 5 years, probably using the UI for 3ish. UI is much better but I wish I would have registered for a Mazda or street stock race one more time on the website for old times sake lol"
I only use the UI. I don’t know why I would need the membership site
"I had no idea there was a way to launch a race from the website, other than test drives during patch hours.

Now that I know about it... why the hell is a website launching an external, non-Web-based local program? Who thought this was a good idea at all, let alone a good idea to keep it going for 15 years?

Bunch of clown developers."
"Only used the member site for statistics, that remains, so no change for me"
Boooo. I need to vent. It's shit.
I only use the website with VRS. Super handy feature to start a practice session in the same conditions as the coach. Now I have to do that manually. No big deal though.
"championship points for the teams, rather than just the individual drivers. if you are able to see this in the UI let me know how"
"I see no sense in wasting time maintaining the website. Its not like it can just sit there. I get people don't like change but I see no reason in asking their developers to be ready for issues that arise on the website, which undoubtedly will and has happened. Any infrastructure changes they make could cause the website to not work correctly.

The UI isn't perfect but it's gotten a lot better and I'd prefer the resources be focused on improving the UI via features and bug fixes. I actually applaud it, so many companies will waste resources to continue to support legacy applications instead of dealing with the initial headaches that arise from forcing users to switch.

I work for a bank, I'm very familiar with the annoyances of working with legacy applications lmao. Even something seemingly as simple as the iRacing website is likely a pain in the ass to debug."
The \*only\* thing I don't like is that I used to use the website when I was away from my pc at home to look up splits for different series. It helped me know how participation was in my time zone for a car track combo. Unfortunately that seems to be gone which is a bummer.
If you're on your work/remote machine use [members-ng.iracing.com](https://members-ng.iracing.com) to see the new UI.
"To me the website is garbage, and I've been here for ten years."
for me it has always been website > ui cuz i simply dont like the ui and i know why they want to progress to the ui and dont leave both open for me its kinda an era of iracing ends
"As a Mac user primarily I'm sorta bummed.  I literally ONLY use my PC to sim race, it was always nice being able to do things from my Mac laptop without having to climb into the rig and boot up the PC"
The only thing I've ever used the website for is launching test drive with matching conditions from VRS.  Hopefully they add a method to do that.
"As an older member, I used the website all the time and never the UI. Now I know how my grandpa used to feel when presented with new tech and new ways to do the same old stuff"
Meh. I prefer the UI. I think most people who give it a real shake do. The web interface isn’t “better” it’s just what people are used to.
"I just wish they would have only removed the ability to join sessions from the website, and left everything else the alone. The website could just be for viewing only, the way it was before they reduced functionality. Like if I want to look at something on the site on my other PC, where I don't have iRacing installed. Now I will have to fire up my sim rig PC just to look at certain things."
"I havent seen the exact update, I mainly use the site for buying and checking the stats of each race after the fact, I assume things like that remain?"
This is my only issue with the UI right now
Yes. Why??
Shite. That's how I pay for things on iracing. Looks like no new content for me for a while.
"IKR, Im pretty sure the CC processor IS Paypal as well, yet you cant make a direct purchace with paypal."
People use PayPal?
"I've been using the UI for a little over a year, I don't like it as much as the website. It is what it is and I'm sure they'll keep improving it."
">  UI works great only downside is less detail on the race result reports I think.

The UI does not work great and just last week the bug came back where the current sessions list displays the wrong track name.

The UI is hot garbage, especially with the bad race results scaling."
That wasn’t even that long ago
Remember when the service was effectively broken for 3 months cause of it? Pepperidge Farms remembers
The popover notifications are bad. Why can’t we just have a notification icon with the notifications behind it like every other app.
It’s generally slower to navigate than the website
"> What makes you hate it so much??

* It displays SIGNIFICANTLY less information.

* It also displays WRONG information a lot, showing things like the wrong track for a session.

* It's much slower to load things.

* The race results scaling is god awful and quite literally shows HALF the information the website results page does.


* All the god damn wasted blank space.

* The whole thing looks like what kids in an HTML class in high school build.  The fact that in 1920x1080, the most common resolution in the world, you can't even see the name of the car in the session list without to fullscreen is a fucking joke

* The modals are annoying as hell, look bad, and function worse.

* The notification popups are just turn everything in to an unreadable mess.

* I could go on and on."
"The thing here is, because you never used the website, you didn't know what you were missing out on.

Things like:

A scaling UI that is actually able to display your entire race results.

Fast loading speeds.

Non-blinding colors.

ALL your driver information.

A functional friends system.

Paypal."
I didn’t realize people used the website for anything other buying new content
"Struts have plenty of security vulnerabilities popping up too, it needs to go."
"The only thing that comes to mind to put a “date” on the website is the feeling of “oh I thought I could click that thing because it looks clickable…but it’s not clickable…but that other thing over there I just accidentally clicked because it didn’t look clickable”. That about sums up my experience of the website. 

The UI literally feels 10 years ahead of the website in look and feel lol"
"> The UX is terrible, the content has accessibility issues, and the information architecture needs a complete overhaul.

This is exactly how I feel about that app and the app *looks* more like it's from 2004 than anything on the website.

It literally displays HALF of the information ffs."
Is the forum going away?
"The race results page actually scales and shows ALL the results, instead of half.

Paypal."
Click the tab in the bottom right corner. Theres a search bar and you can see your friends/following as well
"I don't think you can in the UI right now, but they haven't taken that away from the member site yet. There's also a few third party sites that are faster than the member site's profile page."
"> he UI app is just a website inside the electron wrapper 

Which is why it blows my mind is so hilarious bad and poorly scaled."
The profile page hasn't gone away. You can still see your certificates there. I'm sure they'll add it to the UI before they sunset that page if they haven't already.
"I'm only a broadcaster. . I don't race or anything, but the UI is laggy when ""Watching"" sessions. . ..  So now I don't even know if i'm going to be able to broadcast anymore"
"You literally can't access all your race results without it still.

Nor do the regular race results display properly in the app."
Up Next has a schedule view
I think the website was easier for finding/watching races. .  ..
"The forums are separate from the membersite, there’s no reason you won’t be able to read them on your phone."
"I agree. . . . I think they should keep the website too. . . . . Not everyone can run the UI without lag, etc."
"Yeah they only announced it like a year ago, then delayed it to add more features and then announced it again for real at the beginning of this season. 

And most people who say the UI is awful is because they tried it for 3 minutes, complained because it was different and then just fell back on their crutch of the website. Now they need to actually learn it. "
"Wrong, I just joined iRacing back in September"
Results and stats still works
Nope it doesn't look much different. I just checked.
I haven't looked yet but I don't think so. I think they nuked everything except the forum
Baby steps. Cart and stuff was only added last season.  
I think you can still buy stuff using website?
"No. PayPal is PayPal. 

They have normal CC processor. "
"Yes, just it means you need to store CC details somewhere else to use it."
I’m with you. PayPal is the worst P2P payment system available now. BUT if iracing offered it on the website then they need to offer it on the UI. That’s the only right thing to do.
Umm is there any reason why you don’t like the UI? Personally I feel like I’m using an outdated website from 2010 when I use the iRacing website.
"I get why folks would downvote me but at the end of the day... The website was broken. It's been broken that's why they haven't been able to make any changes. The UI while I don't care for its design is ultimately better functionality wise for the service because it doesn't self-ddos it.

It's unfortunate that folks don't want to accept that and I know that they're going to miss the UI and I don't blame them. But it's also something that will be better for all of us.. and the sooner we get past the website existing, the more we can focus on everyone just trying to push the UI design to be better because frankly that's been really difficult to do when the people using the web UI just say ""just use the web UI""

Now that they're forced to use it, they have to provide input. That's why I want it sunset. Plus it also means that events are less likely to crash the entire service..."
[removed]
"This is my only complaint with the UI, absolutely incessant with the popup notifications which can't be disabled."
"Because even with these big notifications we still get posts like ""iracing is down""  ""my iracing isn't working""  ""I was in a race and got bumped, why?"" ""when is the downtime scheduled""

People ignore the downtime notifications as it is, imagine if it was just an icon you had to click on."
"Perhaps, but yearning for the benefits of an era you were never around for while overlooking the benefits of the era you're in is one of life's many pitfalls that I'd rather not succumb to."
"No, but the ""new"" one just never really hit the mark. Used to be a really popular place, albeit a janky UI."
Huh? Not sure what you mean… then… “paypal?” You drinking? Lol. The legacy results page actually still works too.. link is in the new UI at the bottom of the results page.
"Thanks bro, this is exactly what I was looking for."
"You can in both, and AFAIK, the results page will stay on the website, as will the shop."
Yeah I checked it earlier today when I was looking for my ROAR certificate. I’m glad that page still exists.
"Do you care to explain what you mean with this? Why would you need to interact with the UI when you are actively watching a session? Everything that it would tell you would be able to be seen in-sim, would it not?"
You need to bring your configs in sync. Go check the forums on how to copy your member site graphics config to the one the UI uses. 
Huh? This doesn’t make sense
I don’t see anything that’s anywhere close to the old setup. Its all text based vs a more of a planner style
I think I have watched one or two races in the entire time I have been on the service :-)
Ahh I’ve always gone to members.iracing.com to access forums. Is there a better way?
"Thats it. But you and I should know better, its always been pay to win on every front, shame on us for not having the latest pc i guess.."
"Been on iracing 3 years and never seen any announcement. 
When I started I didn't even know there was a UI as you do it all via the website.
Only ever found out about the UI during a special event weekend when you could only register via UI.
The Webpage is just laid out better, easier to see more at once."
"So like, you were here when they announced it, at the start of the season"
Hope so. Either that or they get pay pal sorted before the end of the season since I'm not putting my credit card into another online database. Been stung in the past.
"PayPal owns braintree, which is a credit card (and other) processor. You even use the braintree SDK for some PayPal actions in some cases (like generating a unique device/fraud id on Android/iOS)"
"But you can use Venmo, which is owned by PayPal"
"I like PayPal. If Im buying something from a somewhere and I see that they take PayPal, I use it every time. If they don't offer PayPal, I just use a different payment method."
That’s because you were lol
That is why I specifically like it. Sometimes simple is easy and nice. Something you've used for years is always easier than something new to start.
"The race schedule on the UI sucks, you can't even scroll to future races beyond like an hour, you have to reset the filter every time you log on, it has races and practice sessions for races that don't tell you when your race is starting and I'm probably forgetting other things that are clearly inferior to the website. I know none of this matters to people that weren't used to the website as the majority of traffic on this sub are pretty new to iracing evidenced by the majority of posts being who's fault is this. I don't really care about any of this but you asked as if I'm nuts for preferring some things about the website over the UI."
Imagine being so insecure you refer to other humans as snowflakes. 🤔
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"Well then, for those who figure out when downtime is, they would still find it - and for those who are too blind or dumb to read the huge popup in the centre of the screen, well, who cares? They can't see it now, what else do you want to do without annyoing those with eyes even more"
"Down time and system announcements should go in an announcement banner. I don’t need 8 popovers for practice results, race results, etc. 

This is a solved problem. Every mature app in the world has solved this elegantly."
Old forum kicked arse new one is terrible
I totally forgot you could search in the friends menu in the bottom right. Thanks for the correction.
"Oh, sorry it's under Series List. Page Layout has a ""race guide"" option.  "

"Yeah. It's more the integration flow. For their CC process they can embed it into the UI seamlessly. PayPal is a bit more involved, especially as they'd likely want to launch PayPal in the users browser rather than a new Electron window, and then callback to the UI to complete the flow. "
"I hate that you can’t use PayPal through the UI, I just find it weird that I could use Venmo, when they are owned by the same company"
"For sure. I raced a lot my 1st 4 years on the service, and it was all on the website. Pretty much since I've switched to the UI, I was busy and couldn't race much and when I did it was a downward spiral of shitty results and then shitty splits which lead to less enjoyment and way less racing even when I do have time."
"What ? The UI absolutely tell you theses things

Or I don’t understand your comment"
"Having used the website for a majority of my time on the service, I'm with you that some parts of it were more intuitive/easier to use, but all the criticisms you have of the UI are simply false. Not sure if that's an issue on your part or I'm misreading"
Why do you have to reset the filter ??
"Yeah I actually kind of agree with that I don't think that of anyone wanting the web UI to stay around at all. No need to insult folks like that.

If I felt the web UI could be salvaged I would absolutely push for them to keep it. But I personally don't feel like it can.

That's why I changed my tune because I used to defend the web UI. Like fervently.

That's what's so awkward about being downvoted on this... Haha"
Hahahahaha. LOL
"Oh, that’s really useful, thanks!"
"I haven't raced this season yet, so I don't know how much they've changed it, but as of 2 months ago everything I said was accurate. I either didn't explain it well enough or you misread or didn't understand."
"Because every time I log on, the settings I made last time are gone. But my least favorite thing about it is having practice sessions on there that don't tell you when your race starts so I start wondering when is this race going to start and I have to quit the session and then find I've missed the race. What's the point of that? So I started putting only races in the filter but like I said, I have to redo that every time. It's nothing that can't be worked around, it's just not as good as the website was in some regards."
"I don't know, just logged on for the 1st time in a few months and a couple filters were still selected. Probably was or is a bug."
"Nah, the UI hasn't changed much the last year, I'm guessing you just didn't know how to use it properly or something's buggy. All the issues you describe are nonexistent for me and all friends that also race, and probably most of the sub"
"What you are stating is not true unless you are not filtering properly. 

This is a user issue but UI. You have it filtered to show only practices. 

There are tabs that you can change to site only race, practice, qualifying etc, out all at the same time. 

The UI is very easy to use"
"Nope, not was I was saying. I know how to filter out the practices. I never said that was a problem. I said I have to redo the filter every time I log on. However, it's stupid AF to have races and practice sessions for those races listed separately and for those practice sessions to be never-ending. 

The UI is not easier to use than the website. (You see, this here is an opinion, not a fact to be proclaimed like some kind of imbecile)"
"I use the inbuilt LFE, would not enable both."
In the HaptiConnect or iRacing? I'll have to check my settings when I get home. Hope you have your answer by then.
I’m pretty sure mine is disabled

"Yes, thank you. I was surprisingly difficult to find documentation and I just wanted to make sure I am getting the most out of it."
"Yeah sorry, I meant the LFE option within iRacing options. I actually reached out to Buttkicker on whether this option was supposed to be enabled, and they responded pretty quickly. Here was their response for any interested:

“The LFE should be turned off, this would send the same kind of signal that HaptiConnect is sending.

This would then overlap the signal making it a lot louder then we want.

Would also affect your ability to adjust effects in HaptiConnect.”"
Ty!
The next gen cars currently don't have a class C series and aren't at Talladega. Are you thinking about the Gen 4 series?
"You can go over the speed limit to gain a few seconds in your pit box. If you know your going to be at he tail end then the penalty is meaningless. But don't go too fast or you'll get excessive speeding with stop and go. I can't remember the threshold, but you can find it pretty quickly in practice. Maybe its 20 or 25 over, but thats valuable time in your box to fix damage. (As long as you don't interfere with other drivers on pit road)"
Old guys racing let's gooo
Could have been a league
Lol yes. Thanks I'll edit my post.
Same with entering closed pits. Penalty is going to the end of the line so if you're already going to be there you might as well enter closed pits.
"Sadly I had the pit leveler on which I never used in previous races. I actually did get a speeding penalty going well over while entering and got the tail end penalty, but already got it earlier when entering the pits just as the yellow was waved after it had just gone green. I also remembered not take tires again when pitting twice for repairs. The yellows do make it more challenging."
Waffleman was correct. I always get the different stock cars confused ever since they started with the COT in 2007.
Still looking?
Yep!
Me too! Are you set on doing the gt3 car? Any experience with gtp?
"I haven’t got experience with GTP other than about 20min in each during maintenance recently, although I’ve driven LMP3 and anything is easier than that thing lol. I would be best at GT3 but any car will do really, be it GTP or even LMP2."
"If you are still looking the 3 of us can team up! I own the Merc GT3, I don't have any experience with gtp or or lmp2"
"If ya'll are still looking, want to make it 4? I'm not the fastest, but I like to keep it clean. CDT in Canada, but I'm always up late."
No bites yet but I'm happy to team up :)
DM me.  Would be good to have at least 3 though.
I could be interested too! on discord here: [https://discord.gg/NG5X9bfS](https://discord.gg/NG5X9bfS) currently class B based in the UK
"I did wonder if I was going crazy after just grabbing an LMP3 setup from Garage61 and having more 10km/h top speed at Daytona while still finding the car easier to tame in the infield. I really don't pay too much attention to setups so it's interesting to see others feel similarly.

And my recommendation if you use Garage61 would be to check the laps list and see if there are any public setups you can add to your folder"
"I like VRS and they tend to fit my driving style pretty well. PDS also seems to work well too.  
iRacing's default sets also aren't a slouch, although the P3 baseline is overly safe and I forget if iR offers the normal Low/Med/high DF options. "
"I tried pretty much every setup shop's Daytona LMP3 set. There was definitely a huge variance with downforce levels and other setup choices, and I think most of them went with too high DF because people would complain about the low DF sets being undrivable (I ended up making my own set from scratch because I couldn't find a decent compromise).

For LMP3 specifically I've found Hymo sets the best of the bunch. But the quality of setup shops for you personally is very heavily dependent on the cars you drive and who is the driver making the sets for them. A setup shop can have great sets for one car and trash for another."
Genuine question : why are people downvoting this post lmao
I liked vrs last season. Always felt competitive
I don’t normally like VRS sets but CSS has definitely fallen off this season. Even using VRS the last three weeks and it’s been solid for LMP3.
VRS has suited me very well for over a year now.
"Grid and Go so far has been good, and with the virtual telemetry you can gain time. I gained 1.5 sec on Daytona. 

Their discord is good and so far I can’t really complain except it is a little pricey. 

I’m just doing a month trial and will be comparing between baseline and paid setup."
"I normally like VRS but for the car you mentioned, I have not seen a setup offered."
"Ive gotten a sub for majors garage for a year since november, so far theyve been pretty good, also different setups from different drivers for some cars."
I have no comparison but im fine at 5K pace with the Hymo Setups
"Try apex racing setups, the super formula setups are kiler. Might be the same.

Plus its super cheap"
"IMO, I valued the VRS telemetry comparison far more than any setup they provided. Ok, if you just race the same few tracks, it is not as important. But knowing WHY you are slower down to a meter-by-meter basis is far more important for anyone below 5k irating than a BIS setup. 

The tool is free, pro setups/telemetry not, so I still use it to track my data even tho I am not subbed due to a lack of ambition in going for the win.

So, it is the best deal for getting OK setups+ insane value. Well, it is more expensive than the Iracing sub so the value is just by comparison to other shops. Setups are terrible in value, since every patch seems to invalidate them."
VRS
"456 Garage, VRS, Pure Driving School, Apex Racing Academy, Majors Garage, Maconi Setup Shop"
"Thanks, I was wondering if I was being paranoid. I will have a look at Garage61 as well !"
I noticed the same thing using Craig's setup for the lmp3 during the ROAR. A few other cars seemed to just walk by me on straights.
"Thanks for your feedback, I'll try VRS today"
"What are the f3 like since suello stopped making those?


The ones from suello were unbeatable."
I second APEX RACING ACADEMY. Setups are good for me and they have a discord to discuss your setup. Like if you need more speed in Daytona. Or more stability etc…. Plus they do group coaching for silver memberships. And do live streams for certain cars to see what is the best option that week.
"Actually im not sure, I havent really raced much f3 lately, as its mostly been a crash fest for me, so I cant tell you sorry"
The Apex setups are usually really good. The Daytona one was absolute garbage imo though. Slow in a straight line and massive understeer and braking issues
The Apex LMP3 setup for Daytona was the worst setup I've ever had from a setup shop
I didn’t have any issues. I did ask for help in the discord and got some more straight line speed out of it. Which helped me when doing the ROAR.
Happens way too often
Oh look a penny!
"Hey hey, for a special event or just in general?"
mainly for special events
Can you do BMW GTP? We need a driver
if u still need a driver let me know my discord is cladpenguin im 2400 irating i just want to compete my usual buddy cant make it.
"The universal answer to this question is ""yes"". "
"Literally a game changer. Excuse me, *sim* changer."
Yes. It’s the best upgrade I ever made.
"Yes, if you have something to mount, if you want to put them on the floor then it will be really hard to use them."
"Yes, but keep in mind that you need a rig, wheelstand or at least a firm chair and a wall to to push the pedals against, a loadcell requires more force than pedals with poti to work properly"
It’s the most important of all your equipment I’d say
Anyone who says no is objectively wrong.
Yes
"Why I’m on the topic of upgrades… is a GT wheel, specifically the Mclaren GT3, worth it vs. an oval wheel, as I’m doing more road racing?"
It‘s literally the biggest upgrade you can get for the sim IMO
Yes
"Yes. Single handedly has increased my confidence and consistency in braking by a huge amount.  From the moment i first used it I understood why it was so important.

when I look at my IR chart I can see a spike from right after I bought the load cell so the proof is in the puddin"
Follow up Q what's the cheapest loadcell worth buying? I can't be spending 500 on a set of pedals but would like the benefits.
"Yes, after a couple of laps with my load cell pedals I improved a second on a track I wasn't improving anymore.   
So yeah... it's worth it!"
"Yes, I think it's in the top 3 upgrades you can make to your setup. (Other 2 being a solid rig and triple screens IMO, I would put all 3 above a DD wheel, but that is number 4)"
The only answer is yes. Anyone who tells you otherwise has never touched a load cell.
I have load cell pedals. Moza SRP. To be honest I’m not sure if I have them set up correctly. I can’t tell a difference between these and non load cell pedals.
"Oh yea. I’m pretty new to sim racing, but I got the t300 gt rs that came with the tp3a’s probably a month and a half ago. I couldn’t drive anything without abs cranked way up. There was no feel. I ended up getting the t-lcm’s like a week later, and fast forward now I’m ripping manual cars with no tc or abs around the Nordschleife like it’s my job. I actually think my bass shaker set up helped a lot too though. Being able to feel how the car is reacting to my input and the track makes a big difference."
It's pretty much the only thing you actually need. I have halfway decent stuff but honestly my original g27 wheel isn't that bad if it's all you got but you need a load cell Imo.
"I’ve ran competitively now in esports for 4 years, and I could not recommend it more. It is the largest upgrade you could ever do and without it it is extremely hard to brake correctly"
As long as you know what to expect! it is incredibly stiff! It definitely takes some getting used to
More than yes. It’s a requirement.
"Here's a new answer: Maybe

I got my first loadcells like a decade ago, it was the Fanatec Clubsport V1s which didn't have the interchangable durometer pucks (or whatever they used on v2s and newer).  Those made me slower than my G27 potentiometer pedals and I never truly got comfortable with them like I did with the G27s.  My gaming died off for a bit (was busy doing real-life track driving which iracing helped immensely with) and I would kind of play a bit every few weeks, always having issues with braking.  My biggest was with modulating off of brakes (decreasing pressure), it kind of behaved like a step function and always decreased more than I intended.

This past few months I did a new pc build and rig build and switched over to VRS pedals and wheel hubs.  Immediately, the brakes felt natural and it gave a lot of confidence and capability of modulation.  It's about as close to a real car as I've experienced.  I've also tried Heusinkveld Sprints and I'd say they were equally natural and easy to use.

So it's a maybe.  I think ""cheap"" load cells may not be great, maybe a 50/50 shot of being better than potentiometers.  But a good loadcell pedal is a massive step up.  So if you can shell out for a good pedal set, then it's worth it.  I didn't do much research on sub $500 pedals as I went straight for the upper range with this build, so I don't know if the cheaper stuff has caught up though."
Are you on PC?
Yes
"As a recent recipient of an upgrade to a LC pedal set... OMFG YES!  Immediate improvement in braking control and overall lap times, and as I get more used to it the faster I am getting."
"Definitely worth, takes a little bit(or a lot of bit, considering the case) to get used to but you'll find you're locking up way less then to no lockups at all due to the muscle memory you can map in your own legs rather than squeezing on just what seemingly feels like air with regular pedals."
"Yes absolutely.  Pedals are the most important part of your setup and changing to load cells is the single biggest improvement you can make in your sim racing career/hobby.  

That said not all load cell pedals are created equally.  Set a budget, do your research and make a decision from there.

Also, my recommendation is to not consider active pedals.  They are VERY expensive, the technology is still pretty new and there is little to no competition between manufactures.  Also for that 99% of racers out active pedals are a waste of money that can be spent on other improvements much like the SC2 Ultimate."
"Definitely yes, but rig comes first"
I just got a set and i’m struggling to adjust a little but I have noticed an improvement overall
">Unfortunately, I’m in the Fanatec ecosystem

How does that matter for Loadcell pedals on PC?"
Absolutely
"Short answer: yes
Long answer: yeeeeeesssss"
Yes
Yes
"I needed to upgrade my rig to withstand the force, but I got that sorted I was matching or beating my old lap times within 30 minutes. The amount of fine control you gain is amazing.

The biggest learning curve so far is learning to brake by muscle memory, eg learning to associate a certain force of my butt pushing up against the back of the seat with a braking level."
"What exactly is a load cell brake pedal, I have pedals that are easier or harder to press depending on the car, is that one?"
"It was a bigger difference for me than going from a Logitech g920 to a fanatec dd..it takes a bit of getting used to, but after that it's up and up"
"There is nothing that is going to affect your overall lap time and car control as much as switching to a load cell brake.

It's also the least ""fun"" upgrade so shelling out the money for a nice one feels weird when you're getting into the hobby."
Yes.
"Has anyone here said ""yes"" yet?

If not, I'm here to say YES!"
Yes
"As others have said, yes :)

Ignoring the ""accuracy"" component, there is another part to this: In a physical car, your braking control is muscle memory from the amount of force you're putting into the brake pedal and the brake are directly responding to that amount of pressure.  Every braking event, your body is going off of feel of how hard to press down. 

A linear sensor is instead going off of the position of the pedal, which is not what our bodies are normally ""tuned"" to feeling in a car.

There is an arguement that throttle and clutch should be linear, but brakes are by far the most important and load cells are really where it's at."
"No.. 

Just kidding.. Hell yeah it is.. it's much more real.  Instead of brake position which is not realistic and your brains not programmed for it, you now have brake pressure..

it takes a little bit of practice but eventually you get muscle memory for how much pressure a spesific car's brakes take before lockup or abs."
"Yes, after you set it up don't forget to check the box letting iRacing know it's a load cell pedal.  I hated mine for the first 8 months LOL!  A literal game changer."
Without question
I don’t think it made me any faster but braking certainly feels nicer. Worth it imo
Yes but look anywhere else but Fanatec as their customer service is gash
Yep
"I know people who race at a pro level on a g29. BUT, they are using load cell pedals. A good driver can make it through the field with just about any wheel even with minimal ffb, but load cell pedals are almost required to get the right input and drive more consistently. You are most likely, in any situation, losing time without them."
"If by worth it, you mean make you more consistent and therefore faster, then yes. 

You'll be fine with your pedals for a little while yet, or you could try a loadcell break mod.

I've had the g29 pedals for 2 years, about 6 months ago I added a loadcell to the break which had a noticeable impact on my lap times. Today I took delivery of the Logitech G Pro pedals. They feel way better than what I had previously, but will take a little practice for me to be as fast."
"Picked up the csl elite v2 pedals on Black Friday and love them.

I can actually drive cars without abs now! 

It’s an upgrade that actually did make me faster. A DD wheel while really cool, didn’t do anything for my pace."
Yes
For anyone looking to upgrade anything on their sim I recommend load cell pedals above anything else.
It's like dating a girl playing the Tuba in the HS marching band to dating a girl that's a gymnast/cheerleader/model.
Am I the only one that didn’t like load cells the first time they tried it
Yes.
Yes many times over.
"Does a duck with a boner drag weeds? Yes

I’m in the Fanatec camp as well. I picked up the CSL Elite V2 during Black Friday. The load cell makes a massive difference. I ended up buying a spring kit for the LC off of Amazon to soften it to my liking."
"I upgraded everything else first cause i thought theres no way the pedals are a more important upgrade than triples or a DD first.... and then i finally got my LC pedals.


You should 100% get LC pedals before almost anything besides maybe a rig to bolt them to"
Quality load cell brakes were the single biggest upgrade made over 3-1/2 years of iRacing.  Saw instant improvement in braking.
"Yes. But it’s not instant nirvana. My race times were pretty much immediately more consistent, but not faster. It took me a couple months-until 2 days ago-to get purple after purple times."
It was the worst decision I ever made. Now I have no excuses for my slow driving ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
Do you want to go faster?
You seriously didn't find an answer by searching the whole internet. Lol
"ESP32 S2: $5

100kg load cell sensor: $8

Hx711 signal amplifier: $3


Some soldering and custom coding... Yeah I think it was worth it. 😁

Fun little project too if you like to tinker."
"Short answer: yes

Long answer: yeeeeeeeeees"
"unless you plan to use the pedals not only for iRacing on PC, but additionally for games on playstation or xbox, then you do not need to have fanatec pedals. I use a fanatec wheel and base with heusinkveld pedals with no issue at all, just plug the pedals via the provided USB cable into the PC"
Trail braking finally clicked for me when I got a load cell
"Being in the Fanatec ecosystem doesn’t matter at all for choosing brakes - you can expand your search to other brands and go direct into the PC via USB.

You may do what I did and go through 4 sets of pedals spending more and more money to arrive at an upper end set (HE Sprints), or save yourself some cash and hassle and go straight to the top. If you’re going to be sticking with sim racing you won’t regret it one bit"
100% yes but I'd get a softer spring from ebay to replace half the elastomers on the stock pedal if you're using the csl pedals. The stock elastomers are way too hard.
100%
I'd argue load cell pedals are more important than a good wheel
"I’ve changed my fanatec elite pedals to a brand new hv sprint, and the upgrade was absolutely insane. So yes, i recommend it 👍🏻"
"Maybe. A stiffer pedal is better than what you usually get stock, but I don't buy into the ""pedal must be rock solid"" nonsense.

If you have non-LC pedals now, see if you can find a cheap way to make them stiffer somehow before you drop big bucks on load cells."
Indubitably🤓
"Yes, especially if you drive cars without ABS. Much easier to avoid locking up with a load cell."
"Yes, or if you’re rich as fuck, get the Simucube active pedals lmao.

In all seriousness, I have a DD2 and club sport v2.5 pedals and honestly I would probably say the load cell brake is even more important than the direct drive, at least when I’m running road courses."
"Let me put it to you like this, if Abraham Lincoln had a load cell pedal, he would still be alive today"
"LC is not universally better for everyone. I personally saw absolutely no benefit from getting one.

While I appreciate that for everyone else chiming in here it's a game changer and whatnot, it does nothing for me. I brought this up on /r/simracing very recently, and largely I just got shit on for having a different experience.

One of the more measured responses I got was that it's not that LC makes a pedal good, it's that good pedals use LC. There are a couple of people that said LC didn't really do that much for them until they got some really fancy high end stuff.

Personally I have the Fanatec CSL LC (probably what you're considering) which a lot of people actually criticize despite it being LC. The #1 (and very common) complaint is that it has too little travel. This is despite the ""no travel, you only need force"" crowd being very adamant that a good brake pedal should feel like a rock.

Anyways, I think people who get a (fancy enough) LC pedal and get benefits from it are very vocal about it; and people who get LC and it's just kind of ""meh"" mostly keep quiet about it, but we do exist. For me, I'm glad I tried it, but if for some reason I had to replace my rig I wouldn't bother getting LC again."
"Yeah. It’s human physiology. To drive a car as fast as possible is to put the car on its absolute limit. In theory, a perfect lap is one in which the only limiting factor was the car itself and the laws of physics. And getting to but not over the limit requires a lot of precision. The closer you get to the limit, the more precise you’re going to need to be. And at a certain point, being precise when the only feedback your body is getting is how far your foot has moved is just not possible. However; modulating pressure in the muscles of your leg is the sort of tree-climbing Great Ape stuff that’s down in our DNA. It’s matching the pedals to the strengths of human evolution instead of asking our bodies to adapt to the pedals. So; more precision is possible. It’s just that simple."
"As an add:

Commonly, people invest in better wheelbases and wheels first. Which makes sense, it’s what you touch and feel. And it might make sense for some people; this is a game after all so as long as what you’re doing doesn’t harm anyone else there’s no wrong way to do it. 

But from a pure PERFORMANCE point of view; you’ll be faster with a load cell pedal and a cheap G27 off of Facebook Marketplace than you will be with top of the line direct drive wheelbase and the pedals from a G27."
Absolutely.
"And if it's not ""yes"", then it's ""hell yes!"""
The best analogy I can think of is that it would be light a diver asking where he should up grade from feet to flippers.
"Disagree. LC didn't really improve anything for me.

PS: please don't downvote me for being different, or try to mansplain how I'm doing things all wrong. I've already heard it all. I just want to be on the record that the answer is not strictly speaking ""universally"" yes."
"That was close, buddy.  Don't let it happen again.  :D"
"I recently upgrade from Thrustmaster T3PMs to T-LCMs and while I think it's making me better and more consistent long term, it wasn't the immediate improvement (for me) that I sort of expected. I found that it took me a couple of days to get back to my previous pace.

In my opinion they're definitely better, but whether it's worth everyone going out and upgrading their current non-load cell pedals? I'm not so sure, unless you're super keen to spend money upgrading something.

I'm sure this will probably be a little unpopular because I know the overriding opinion is that load cell = immediate improvement, but just thought I'd share my slightly different view."
Take your angry upvote.
"It's OK. iRacing calls it a game, right on their front page."
I have a rig so mounting isn’t an issue.
"Yep, I have a rig!"
"Seconded

I've got mine wedged against a wall and I'm sat on a wheeled chair with shoes under two of the wheels and I'm sure it's probably costing me half a second a lap. Probably once a race I have to try and shift the chair forwards again after panic braking a little too late on an overtake"
"Won’t make you faster, load cell will definitely make you faster"
"I find having the buttons and encoders is very helpful for GT and prototype cars, but hard to say if its 'worth it' without knowing what wheel you already have. If you have a round wheel with buttons and encoders prob not a big difference, but if its a plain round wheel then yeah maybe.  


I have the Mclaren V2 and think its great, killer value for $200 and while it has some flex I'm very content with it."
"I love my McLaren GT3 wheel it’s about all I use for road racing nowadays. It’s comfortable, inexpensive and the button layout is intuitive for my hands compared to the formula wheel."
"An oval wheel does absolutely everything, the Mclaren wheel does make GT racing feels more immersive and I like how you can shift up and down on either side but it does need a metal QR1 for its full potential. 

If you’re on a budget don’t get it. If you’re curious and have $250 to spare then sure, resale is good on it anyway so it’s not exactly risky."
"I mean if you were really strapped and already had a g25/27/29 etc the TrueBrake by AXC is almost as good.  It's helped me get a lot faster and find that muscle memory to hit my max pressure, trail braking, etc.  and its 54.99 gbp"
"Simjack pros, I love mine"
I plan on buying the Fanatec load cell kit for my CSL pedals. I think it’s about $140.
"Fanatec CSL w/ LC Kit in my opinion. I had them, no complaints for a $200 set of pedals."
"T-LCM. Beyond that it's all about appearance, adjustability and possibly longevity. There's no difference in actual braking precision."
"If you don't mind my asking, what rating and how much experience did you have prior to switching?


It took me 2 weeks to get back to my pace, and a year later I'm still no faster -- just more consistent. But this is after 10+ years of refining technique on a potentiometer and being around 4k iR."
How about a GT wheel for road racing vs. an oval wheel? Haha.
Not even the top 3. It is absolutely the #1 top upgrade you can do. All other upgrades provide convenience or immersion. Pedal upgrades are the only ones that actually improve your performance on the track.
Awesome dude!
What else does iracing run on?
Yes
"Crappy customer service, logistical nightmare, unreliable company"
What about a flutist?
![gif](giphy|7YItDIys6EN7CnnVqD|downsized)
Ssssh! You’re gonna put Reddit outta business with that kinda talk!
I ended up ordering the Fanatec load cell pedal. I’ll start off on the low end for now.
Skill issue tbh
"I’m not trying to be a jerk but if load cell pedals aren’t making a difference; then you weren’t really on the limit. And that’s okay! There’s nothing wrong with that. But if you’re able to put in the exact same times with LC pedals and non-LC pedals, then there’s significant room for improvement on technique.

So it *may* be the case that not everyone would find good value in them; but it’s really not the case that they’re not universally better."
😂
"You change from distance based input to pressure based input and to a stiffer pedal. Some time to adjust is to be expected. It's not an unpopular opinion, it's everyone's experience."
Then i would say it is best upgrade you can make rn
Check out rollerblade wheels with locks for your chair. I have a wheel stand and use to have to ratchet strap my chair to it just because of my load cell. Now I don’t move a millimeter.
QR2 anyone??
"I second this. As someone who went from a g923 to Asetek DD bundle, that Truebrake mod for the Logitech was honestly SUPER solid for the price and was a no brainer. Made a huge improvement in my breaking. Should be factory on those pedals tbf."
"Ran a cheap load cell mod like this on my g27 pedals for over a decade, now I have the Fanatec V3s and honestly the difference is minuscule."
Yeah I do have g29 been considering an upgrade like that tbh.
I bought minis and just remounted the pedal faces to make them taller.
"I have this same one, can confirm it's definitely worth it."
"Ah yeah probably a good bet. I'm in the UK so fanatec are off the table for me due to their ""maybe we'll send you something maybe not"" shipping policy to us. 

Shame really."
">I plan on buying the Fanatec load cell kit for my CSL pedals. I think it’s about $140.

I was considering the same upgrade, but i think i'll go for the SimJackPedals Pro. They're at the same price, and everyone talks about them very good. Give them a look."
Ah I mentioned in other comments fanatec is off the table due to me being UK based and their apparent lack of interest in UK market.
"Yeah been looking at those actually. I didn't wanna go down the thrust master ecosystem route but possibly I could just get the pedals and use with a different wheel etc. 


You reckon they'd be better than the moza ones?"
"Had an iRating of 1500 (playing for 4 months) so still in my infancy of iRacing 😁
Bought load cell pedals because of Black Friday."
"Now this one doesn’t actually matter, except for the weight difference in the wheel. You could get more or less feedback depending on the weight.

Beyond that wheels are just preference."
Load cell pedals is the far better upgrade.
"Not always, but almost. Imagine someone simming on gaming laptop with a 14"" screen. I'd get a monitor first."
"I should have been more clear, I was probably too focused on the ecosystem comment. but how are you trapped in a Fanatec ecosystem if you have a PC?"
No. He's wondering why you even said that? You're on a PC. You can whatever you want. USB is universal lol.
Well that goes without saying 🤔
"Then do it!!! My biggest lap time gain was upgrading to load cell pedals, my next biggest lap time gain was upgrading to DD wheel"
"Yeah something isn’t bad because you’re not immediately better with it lmao

My friend bought a Logitech wheel and gave up on it after a day cuz he was slower than he was on a controller I was like I don’t know what you expected after **one** day"
Thanks man!
Love it. Hobbies breed ingenuity!
At least a metal qr1 to be more precise
"I've not run a bunch of actual load cells for a long time to say for sure it's the same, as AXC says, it's not a strain gauge load cell, but it's much much better than stock g29 brakes and it's very cheap comparatively."
Whatever works
"Well, due to the overwhelming “yes” responses, I’m sold! Thanks!"
"simjack pros on ali express, get them with one hydraulic rod will be about £200 once you get stung for import tax

Buy some skateboard bushings for £5 on amazon to change the brake spring with and you got yourself and amazing brake set, ive defo got much faster with them in the month since ive had mine, and they are highly modable to be how you like them"
"Yeah, I’m new to iRacing and initially had some issues getting all my gear from Fanatec."
There's a bunch of UK suppliers now. I'd likely buy from over if them going forward just to avoid dealing with Fanatec direct.
"Try MOZA’s entry loadcell. I haven’t used it. 

https://mozaracing.com/srp-pedal

I do run MOZA’s R9 and KS wheel. It’s solid stuff."
"There's no ecosystem. Plug them into your PC with a USB cable.

It's a no-bullshit USB peripheral. I like that. The construction is simple, easy to understand, modify and maintain. If you like a very hard brake pedal with very short travel, you can replace the springs for skateboard bushings or springs from Aliexpress for a few euros/dollars.

I use the VRS DFP wheel base, Polsimer wheel, and T-LCM pedals. I don't see what I could gain from switching out any of the components, except for having a prettier wheel or pedals, if that matters."
"Oh, I’m pretty ignorant and not tech savvy."
I've never used a loadcell so I won't know what I'm missing but if it makes it easier for me to brake consistently then I guess it could be a good shout. Thanks for the suggestion.
Simjack Pros were 50% off on AliExpress..... Hard to refuse at that price!
"I’ll add a no. I guess for the price they’re ok but you could spend $150 more and get something better like the p1000s. 

The brake pedal is super loose and wiggles and there’s not a whole lot of customization within the software. They work as brake pedals but leave a lot to be desired. 

I’d save your money and buy the simagic instead."
This is what I'm gonna do... found about them yesterday and have since watched every youtube vid on these pedals. Convinced.
Can you point me towards some? I looked in the past and couldn't find any....
I totally didn't know the entry level pedals they sell are loadcell. That's great. Will look into that.
That is precisely what the internet is for yo
"yeah they should be around $250 for the 3 pedal set, the 50% off thing is fake, theyll never be $500, the ""sale"" is always there

and then you can usually add aliexpress coupons for $30-50 off for even more savings, i got mine for $215"
"Well, I already have the pedal set, so I’d be adding just the load cell pedal for only $140"
"Do it, you won’t regret it, defo get a skateboard bushing though"
"Understand I've not extensively investigated, but simdemon and digital-motorsports seem to have UK stock."
"Their support is mainland China. While they aren’t exactly quick, they do come through. At least in my experience."
Which is?
"Paid the equivalent of $150 for the 2 pedal set, so I guess you're right!"
In that case go for it. Not much to lose at that price
"Cheers! Fully intend to, though was considering the [3DRAP elastometers](https://www.3drap.it/product/fanatec-csl-elastomer-brake-mod-csl-pedals-lc/) instead of bushings after watching [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVcdxnKLGTc). Though the difference is likely negligible. 

I just never heard of a skateboard bushing before yesterday ;D"
"to learn - to ask question - to find out by asking it questions   


it is an endless source of information. lol"
"No idea tbh could go to great detail modding them lol. The stock ones will die eventually and spent enough to start with so just got the skateboard bushings since it’s extremely cheap

Will look at other options when the stock ones start to perish"
"Long distance truck racing? Love it, I’ll join!"
If anyone has any questions and would like to know more please DM me.
Can't wait to say hello!
"First Street Stock in rookie, it can be quite a wreckfest but it will be useful. Don't try to overtake or battle, just save your SR because it's really hard to rise it on oval

Then Arca to learn on bigger oval tracks with splitstream, huge speeds and saving your tyres

Then you'll be able to buy the Dallara IR18 to run on oval. You can already run it if you have a B Road Licence, because the Indycar Open Series also runs on oval (5 weeks out of 12)"
"Should be noted Indy cars are bit different from other oval series.

You generally dont use brakes\[aside from a 5-10% dab at some corners, like Motegi this week\] and you dont really need to worry about tires as much."
"If your are interested in IndyCar ovals, my biggest advice when you get there is hop in a practice session and get used to running around people. The IndyCar is really easy to hot lap on an oval, but in a race setting, the aero wash really catches people out. Run around other people and get used to searching for clean air and lifting to settle your car when following someone closely.

If you are interested in open wheel ovals, USF2000 is D class and runs some ovals to get you some experience. The ARCA car is great if you are looking the NASCAR route, but as mentioned, what makes the car go fast over a run is very different from the IndyCar."
Remember to never turn right.
"Contrary to other advice, I'd grind to C-class in the rookie classes (Legends or Street stock) then stick to the Indy oval fixed series. (Assuming that's all your interested in). I don't think Arca or any other series will benefit you that much.

But again if you're interested in other cars and series you can always branch out and a cost $$"
Well I just did my first Oval race (rookie legends)…and only bloody won it! Was running in 4th but the three in front of me kept crashing into back-markers. Was a lot of fun.
"Turning with the brakes and gas as much as you do with the steering wheel

Don’t try to force a turn, let off the throttle a bit more and ride out the line. Keeping tire temps down is critical.

It’s okay to brake early and let off the gas early, and often times it can help you get out of the corner 
quicker. 

Small adjustments matter as much as big ones, if not more. Keep your inputs simple and precise, don’t try yanking on the steering wheel.

You’re bound to run street stocks and arca, and those series will have plenty of participants to go official nearly every reasonable US and EU session. From there, considering your open wheel pursuits, the sk and tour modified series would do you well.
Since your pursuits are superspeedway oval, I also recommend learning patience and conservation of your car and yourself. The 500 is a LONG race"
"If you don't have any interest in stock cars, scope out a week when USF2000 is at an oval and get your feet wet there and earn your C license. 

As others have mentioned, lapping the Indycar is easy at most ovals but managing aero wash in traffic is where the real challenge is at.

I know you said you're gearing up for the 500 but as a road driver don't sleep on the short ovals, they require a bit from the road toolset to go fast and are an absolute blast (and all the oval only guys are mysteriously absent, because they just can't hang)"
"Thanks for the response. Yeah I did think the SR gains in oval seemed more difficult than on road, less corners I guess."
Yeah I was thinking about the USF2000 but nobody in my time zone seems to run it. There might be an SoF race at some point
Haha I’ll keep it in mind
I only race tin tops on road so I’m definitely interested in doing the same in oval. Just need to dust off the old wallet
Yeah just did a rookie legends race on a tiny oval and somehow managed to win it. I tried the street stock but couldn’t get to grips with it
"The top reply here is great OP, the only thing I’d add is you should do some Gen 4 races since you’ll own the car anyways, once you get to C. This will introduce you to pitting and yellow flags, neither of which are in ARCA or street stocks, but they are a big part of the 500."
"Exactly, any 4x in a 10 minutes race ends with a loss of SR because there are only two corners"
"If you find yourself exclusively turning right, you've probably left the pits in the wrong direction."
I would say that the Arca/Gen4 is probably the best value right now for oval. Two different cars/series with good participation. The Gen4 is an absolute animal in comparison though
"Its 4 corners for every oval besides Pocano.  

&#x200B;

Good thing cuz super speedways would be extremely bad for SR\[instead of just bad\]."
hahaha
"You're right, they changed it last season if I remember, it's a bit easier now"
"Good thing too,  super speedways where hell.  


Now Pocano remains alone in the dephts of SR hell."
Hi there. Still looking for driver? Me and my friend looking for same. Interested?
Yep still looking!
Send me your discord. Let's discuss there
To be fair that looked pretty unsafe.
You’ll have that on these big jobs. But 10 points for style tho.
Well yeah obviously they don’t want you jumping the wall and pitting backwards to save time /s
High tower/stewards being sadistic this point.
I fucking love this car/track combo lmao.
how dare you to pit so dangerously? 40s isnt enough clearly
"I made it through fine, then got destroyed at the end of the straight with someone having a tank slapper after they broke 30m too early so I dunno how they managed that

Worst part is they continued and gained irating whilst I had to tow and ended up 18th and my average lap was the fastest in the race once I came out of the pits"
Idk what happens there. It’s all gas no brake. Doesn’t seem very easy to crash
"Nope, SPA is most of the dangerous tracks in the service. Because people start acting like F1 superstars but actually can't drive even like my grandma."
"Spa is fine, F4 is  fine, Just don't crash"
"I had pretty great races at both Tsukuba last week and Spa last night. I'm in the bottom two splits usually, so right in the middle of where most carnage happens, but mostly if you know where to expect big errors from drivers, and pay attention, you can usually avoid them. Once people spread out, you can get a better read on those around you, and anticipate when they are going to do something stupid. 

To modify a Jack Sparrow quote: ""Me, I’m a terrible driver. And a terrible driver you can always trust to be terrible. Honestly. It’s the goods ones you want to watch out for. Because you can never predict when they’re going to do something incredibly… stupid.”"
"Spa week brings out all the Verstappens. 

The safest racing most often takes place in the lesser populated series on less popular tracks."
"F4 is the first car most people buy, then they use it for 4-5 weeks and realize it's nothing but pain and buy gt4+gt3👍🏼"
Conflating a sport to war is pretty tone deaf and ignorant. Try harder.
"I like getting forced off track going into turn 6 when I have the inside, or having someone spin me around on the last lap for now reason"
That just so happens to be the true nature of sim racing on spa. Happens in almost every series due to people with limited knowledge of the track.
No. Imagine taking Raidillon Eau Rouge in a Sherman tank.
That's the Ling lat apex right hand turn right? Things a bitch
My only race so far at spa was done on Eau Rouge but Bruxxelles I got dive bombed on lap 1 and then pushed off track and spun. I was hoping this week would be fun but I may just start from the pits and let everyone in front of me create chaos
Try Talladega or Daytona in Nascar if crashing is what you want. 😁
"I love the F4 series, and I quite like SPA, but for some reason it is one of my worst tracks, I have decent pace (2.22.8-2.23.6 most laps) but always end up in a punt on either the last chicane, or les Combes, n I don’t need the Reddit bois saying u could’ve avoided it yadayada I’m well aware every incident could be avoided if u could see into the future, but most of the time I typically expect the cars around me to use their brake, not use me AS their brake. I’ll keep racing it and keep losing iRating 😂 I’ve fell from 2k to mid 1600s currently"
It’s really a shame because that car is so ridiculously fun to drive on a track you know well
In my experience a lot of it is down to people not giving up the position and trying to go through 2 wide because they have a 1cm overlap on lap 1.
I really don’t think people practice enough or they get nervous about others driving like idiots so they brake on raidillon in which causes a huge crash because others aren’t lifting or braking.
Drivers who have only ever driven it on their own suddenly having to take a different line because they're alongside other cars.
There’s plenty of break
Never underestimate just how bad 90% of sim racers are at sim racing.
"SPA = Start from Pits Always


I kid but sometimes it be like that lol"
"I wish I would’ve saved the replay of this incident. It was shocking how bad it was lol. I even went off the track where I could to avoid it, got 1x, and within that time I had a car run into me and I got a 4x. Decided to cut my loses and forfeit that one"
It was 80 years ago I think we can make a stupid joke now
lol bro relax have a skittle or something
It’s honestly infuriating seeing how many people don’t research general racing conduct before hopping into iRacing. I’ve gotten very fucking good and know when an idiot is going to divebomb on the inside due to how much that happens
meh im all in on formula tbh lol so ill keep going but my irating is like a yoyo cause I keep going through spells of wrecking every race
"Actually, two wide in that corners are possible, easy. Just need two not idiots who leave tha space and go little bit slower."
oops yes but only when you brake
"I believe it.

Also, never forfeit. So many people are gong to crash at spa, you can finish higher than you expect."
if I see someone divebombing me in corners I just let them pass but then they do that every for we and i’m overall faster then them and struggle to pass till a long straight lmao
I feel your pain.  I claw my way back to 1k just to get a 4x on a formation lap from someone who spun out lol.  My irating is a constant roller coaster of up to 1k down to 700 back to 1k lol
I wouldn’t be surprised if some people have a separate iRacing account for formula races. I’m gonna get stuck in some shitty mx5 and ff1600 lobbies for a few races
Yeah like it’s seriously just a half lift of the throttle for half a second and you can go 2 wide fine
My favorite move is to brake heavy at the perfect time so they run off the track instead of hitting me. Pisses them off every time
"I love 2 wide turns, feels so dangerous."
Hmmmm I’m curious about this as well. That’s odd.
Is there a setting in the .ini file that I could tweak to get the driving view to look as good as the replay view?
"This is kind of crazy, every time I thought of a setting that might do this, they matched from replay to live...

This is definitely a case of having to dig deeper. Have a look in the .ini and see if there might be something about car textures. Maybe there's something that's still kicking in LOD stuff? 

Good luck, I'm hoping you figure it out, and now I'm also curious what the heck is causing this."
I believe that you are able to independently change the replay graphics and racing graphics by the reply tab at the bottom. I recently learned this by using screen capture and was able to improve the graphics for the replay.
"I'd imagine it's simply cause in real time it's calculating far more than basically replaying a video which it does watching the replay. More resources being used, apart from that if settings are identical, no idea"
"Just be aware, most AA options will make things look rounder at the cost of being more blurry at distance. 

I personally would rather have crisp graphics and jagged edges, rather than have a blurry game"
Replay will almost always look better because it's less intensive on your system when it isn't trying to also calculate a race going on.
"Well, yeah - I have the replay and (racing) graphics tabs in the screenshot I posted"
lol this is the best pseudoscience I've read in a long time.
"Thing is that the replays aren’t videos. They are pretty much the entire race data that the game then must process. Instead of receiving that data from server and players, it just receives it from the rpy file. It still needs to process everything"
Hmmmmmmm
"My bad, didn't see that there were two screenshot. On the reddit app it showed as one photo."
Moral of that story: clean racing gets reaults
Not even car/track specific for me. This has been my life since hitting 2k 6 months ago. I went as low as 1500 and have been yo-yoing every since. When I can get a clean race I place well but then I usually wipe out all that progress with a -60 DNF for one reason or another.
That was my plan till I came around a blind turn 1 to a 3 car pile up. I tried to go left and a car backed up. Went from points to dead last
"Yep, I'm happy with the 3.4 SR(B license)"
"Honestly, i think the entire incident at La Source is caused by your move inside. I think the black car corrected slightly when they saw you inside and their, albeit small, correction spooked yellow who turned out into red/black. 

The later incident at Radillion is on the guy who ran into the back of you."
im confused. are you trying to say spaghetti day?
Last time I checked people go to spa's to relax ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
first incident is 100% on the yellow car for veering left and clipping that guy. absolutely 0 awareness of his surroundings.  not your fault at all.
"I was trying to sneak a race in on break to get my SR up. Lost .02 instead :)  


Also, sorry to the 14 car on Radillion if you're out there, I thought I could manage the wheel damage."
100% POV at fault.....the cone never deserved that level of disrespect....I saw nothing wrong with anything prior to the cone incident or after... Just Normal clean spa.
[removed]
Never saw it that way. I tried to make sure he had plenty of room!
Everyday is Spagehetti day if you're brave enough
"After the tow, it was open space! Nice and peaceful."
"Yeah I thought it was a good move. 

Funny thing is, I thought it was a funny clip, then everyone started acting like stewards 😅"
Maybe not dive bombing t1 would help your SR
I did it on purpose. Those blue cones think they're high and mighty and never invite the orange cones to do anything.
Maybe read my other response before flying off the handle like a petulant child
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"I was convinced we were about to watch you skittle half the field there! Very easily someone could have been cutting back for the run on the next straight and you had no safety margin even though you *just about* made the apex.

I wouldn't be surprised if the yellow got a 3 wide spotter call and over reacted to cause the initial crash, and then the wobble you had in Eau Rouge was caused by your tyres being overheated from the spin.

So although you aren't 'guilty' of any wrongdoing, it could be said your turn 1 approach is what caused both incidents. It's worth reflecting on it IMO to understand how you can survive races better!"
"I dont mean to imply you're at fault. Just that your move started the cascading sequence of events. You seem to have left space and made the corner without contact. Just the extreme angle gave a spook and caused yellow to overcorrect, right into red/black."
I feel like it was barely a dive bomb. Everyone had room. Couldn't go anymore to the left without causing a direct crash. Yellow car over-corrected.
100% cone has protest against you
"please explain to me how its OPs fault. what he did was completely valid. Even if the yellow car had triples (Which I seriously doubt given that he just rammed into the guy left) OP was behind and to the right of him, with a car in between. Yellow car had no idea he was there, and the black car didn't correct for shit. any aware driver could expect 2-3 wide at turn 1 lap 1 la source. this accident happened because the YELLOW car didnt hold his line, overreacted to the black car and killed the other black car."
I swear to God I refelected on this situation yesterday and ran a race last night. Got rear ended here instead 🤣
That was definitely a dive bomb.
"Good luck, I mean who stops on the racing line?"
"Child, again, please read my response. I did not put blame on OP, i said their move started the cascade. Yellow is at fault. 

Regarding the other details. Were you the driver of the black car? Then you can offer ZERO insight as to what they did or didn't do. You even state in this response 

>happened because the YELLOW car didnt hold his line, overreacted to the black car

What could yellow POSSIBLY be overreacting to???"
Sometimes you are just a passenger to other people's mistakes!
Ehh what am I supposed to do then?
"... I already said it, the black car. can you not read? There was no need to veer left. completely avoidable incident if yellow just doesnt drive like a scared imbecile. divebomb from OP or not, everyone was making it past turn 1 until yellow decided to try and avoid a crash that wouldve never happened if he just kept going straight."
"It's bottom split, everyone's learning, including myself. Didn't realize how overly critical people on this sub are though."
"Not brake at the absolute latest moment when everyone is barreling down the same corner as you. 

There's a reason people say ""don't try to win the race in T1"". You clearly did try to win the race in T1, which is perfectly legal and you did keep it ""clean"", but it's not going to make you friends and it's going to end in tears more often than you want."
"It would seem that you're the one who is incapable of comprehending what others have written. You're agreeing with me, you just dont realize it."
[removed]
"I'm agreeing with you mate, take it on face value - sometimes you just can't avoid what they are going to do.

And my original comment was to just raise the idea that the second crash was possibly linked to the first. Learning that overly aggressive starts often don't pay off was an important lesson for me!"
"Well then I guess it's instant Karma.

The guy behind was on my tail and I couldn't just fall I'm line behind the red car. Tbf I was only at 60% BP"
">Honestly, i think the entire incident at La Source is caused by your move inside.

tell me again how youre agreeing with me?"
I'm learning that quickly.
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"Nah man, that comment wasn't direct towards you!"
"Maybe finish reading the paragraph and stop cherry-picking single lines. Jesus. It's not difficult.

""Caused by"" does not equate to ""fault of,"" which i place on yellow in the following comment. Are you really that thick?

Here, I'll help you out since you seem to be incapable of independent thought or the capacity to read beyond any combination of words you think you disagree with.

"sure bro. youre right. whatever you say, including your new definition of cause and at fault

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 **cause** /kôz/

### noun

1. The producer of an effect, result, or consequence.
2. The one, such as a person, event, or condition, that is responsible for an action or result"
"If you filed the protests you have the replay files right?  Let's see what happened. We can give you advice an avoiding this incidents in the future. 


These crybaby posts never have replays. I wonder why."
"This might not sound very nice, but it looks like you are in a lot of wrecks with a lot of people and the only constant is you.

It's hard to judge what happened with text messages, but it's also your own responsibility to avoid accidents. And sometimes you need to do what you need to do, set your pride aside and press that brake pedal to survive a wreck.

It's better to finish one position down, then to have a DNF. So, go to youtube, watch some clips about situational awareness and wrecking avoidance and try to put them into practice. And don't forget to have fun!"
you've had *six* intentional wrecks in a row? I've had over 700 and I'm not sure it's ever happened to me. Are you sure what you're saying is true?
"Rudskogen and now Bathurst are both tight, twisty, technical tracks. Lots of wrecking or people being impatient. It'll get better on the more wide open tracks."
Keep in mind gt4 is Bathurst this week.
"It's Daytona 24 week and we just came out of the ROAR, so big influx of people who may not have done a race in months and just want to warm up to participate in the big event."
"you felt the need to protest 6 times? You do realize protests are a waste of time don't you???

"For me it’s mostly clean, but I run mostly the porsche cup and IMSA. What’s your irating? It tends to get better as you progress. Try to qualify better to start further ahead and avoid mid field chaos. Also, check the first tip of this video, it helps a lot against punts: https://youtu.be/R6yb7Fm8m6o?si=V21sqSn8Q_olbPAF"
"It’s just how it goes.  I ended S4 with 48 Top 5s in 60 races.  I’ve started S1 with a DNF, in all 7 starts - only 1 my own fault.  It just happens.  Keep at it and keep your head up."
Life is full of disappointments. Use the experience and move on. Just think about the races that you've made through without any incidents.
It happened a lot when it was released on steam
"A couple others have said it, but we’re at Bathhurst this week. There are going to be wrecks. It is just one of those tracks where you go in expecting it

I’ve gotten destroyed twice in a row, neither my fault. Whatever. It is what it is on the mountain. No use crying about it. "
"It does happen around Christmas. But you're also lumped into that category. 

Trust me if you stick with it you'll start to develop a 6th sense for when things will go bad."
"I have not noticed any change, though I race the C class gt4 multiclass."
"If you are new and asking, then you are likely decently self aware while you are still learning the ropes, so here are a couple things to watch for.

Sales and gift season: you are right that people get/buy hardware around Christmas. Combined with iracing black Friday sale and you do get people trying out the service. Some may not know better, but they do tend to stick to the free content in this time period.

Track rotation: some tracks are very tricky just to lap, let alone race. Expect lower rated drivers to make many mistakes and miscalculations. Also, some tracks have corners that tend to invite people into the vortex of danger... You'll learn which ones you need to defend a little more aggressively out of self preservation. 

Don't attribute to malice what is most likely a mistake: pro drivers crash and make dumb moves sometimes. 99.9% of us are not pro level, so rookies-gonna-rookie and crashes are gonna happen. In close quarters, drivers lose line of sight and miss braking markers in the heat of battle. Try not to take it personally. Always watch the replay (especially from their cockpit view)."
‘I’ve been on iracing a little over a month now’.  Immediately stops reading the rest of the complaints. You’re not good enough bro. Come back in 6 months and I’ll finish reading what you have to say.
"Think about it for a second. You have been in a wreck six races in a row, involving different drivers each time, and for some reason you think it must be everyone else?"
"I'm a competent driver.  Aware of the fact driving too safely or slowing down unexpectedly can cause crashes.... I'm just saying, there has been an influx of BS all of a sudden."
Or they only show 1 blurry angle.
"This should be pinned somewhere because I swear I read one of these ""it's not me, it's them"" posts a few times a week."
">the only constant is you

This is the most overused trope on this sub. Anyone who has raced for any length of time knows that while you can avoid accidents, and you can reduce your chance of being in accidents by driving a certain way, there are times when your luck simply runs out.

Racing involves a certain level of risk, and a certain level of trusting other drivers to drive in a predictable way. The only way to avoid any risk is to not enter a race, or maybe to drive like you do on the road, leaving a nice 2 second gap to the car in front. And come last.

I'm not saying this is the case for OP, I have no way of knowing. But the implication in that statement is that you always bear some responsibility when you are involved in an accident, which just isn't most people's experience."
He’s mistaking poor driving skill for malice. I’ve been on iRacing since black friday and have encountered zero intentional wrecks. I’ve protested one questionable divebomb and someone stopping on the pit exit though—neither of which were intentional just incredibly stupid.
I could only believe 6 in a row if they did back-to-back NiS Bristol. No way that happens in the 30/15 min GT4 events unless its the same driver every time
"Silverstone was a pretty clean week, the only person that caused trouble for me was me"
"If you really want to learn how to drive a GT4 car then do it around Bathurst! Super technical, walls with ?x available and fast corners with a need for trail braking and trying to avoid abs in GT4. I am sure most tracks will be a breeze after this week!"
I did ROAR. In my split the driving was clean and everyone was courteous. As my first multi class race I enjoyed it thoroughly.
Weird. Mine are almost always successful. I've seen several people I protest not race for a few weeks after getting the result. You think that's just a coincidence?
Crazy how the people who see Sasquatch always have 80 pixel cameras 
Just make a seperate post adressing this issue and pin it in the sub?
There’s at least 1-2 every day.
"If you take a dice and give every side a reason to DNF. You label side 3 as ""Got taken out by somebody else"".

If you roll that dice 10 times, how big is the chance that you roll 3 every time?"
"It's 'overused' because it is true, if you constantly have wrecks that you think aren't your fault, you gotta look at yourself critically. Obviously you can't avoid 100% of the idiots, but you can avoid most of them, and that is something that all the guys posting this exact kind of thing son't understand or want to realise. There's a good reason it is the constant amswer, because it's true"
"I'm 1 year in and just had my first blatant intentional and reportable incident. The car that finished behind me turned and ran directly into my stopped car before I could disconnect. I wasn't even mad, just surprised lol"
"I’ve actually had two in recent weeks. Must be something in the water. 

One was in a practice session. I spun on a corner and took another guy out. Totally my fault. In response he followed me around the track or waited in various places to intentionally wreck me. Seems like a well adjusted fellow. 

Another was at Spa in the MX-5. Moving up Eau Rouge on the right side of another car. And they performed a PIT maneuver. 

Both protested successfully, according to the email I got. But yeah, was kinda weird having it happen twice in short order."
Even then most of the cautions on short tracks are still just incompetence. Like no one is pitting someone intentionally on lap 12 of 150. It’s just hard to drive in close quarters.
"That's great, but OP was asking if there was a sudden influx of bad drivers this month.  Any major event draws in lots of drivers, both good and bad so objectively there are more bad drivers online until the Daytona 24 ends.  If you're split is clean it doesn't really say much about the other 20+ splits happening too."
"My raging quit when I started looking at replays before I opened my mouth.  Realizing that things aren't always what they seem really helps.   Accident avoidance is the biggest skill in the sim.  You can run faster than everyone else, but if you seem to ""always"" be the one wrapped up in an accident, then there is something you are doing.  I posted a video not long ago of a major wreck on a road course in F4.  ARCA brakes on an open wheel?  Apparently..."
"That's not my point. If you're saying that OP's claims to have been taken out six races in a row are unlikely to be true, then I don't disagree.

My point is that ""the only constant is you"" has the implication that there is always something you can do about accidents. But I don't agree that's the case. Most of the time? Yes. But all of the time? I don't believe so."
"My objection is to the condescending tone of it. I basically read it as ""if you're in a wreck it's probably your fault (or at least partly your fault)"". As if the person saying it never ever has an accident.

If you're constantly in wrecks then there's almost certainly a problem with your driving. But everyone gets involved in an accidents from time to time, and sometimes it's just not your lucky day."
Normally yeah. But 500 laps of Bristol really brings it out in people haha. Same with the coke 600
"I feel like I'm proof of accident avoidance being important. I'm a bit off pace to others at my iR but I gain a lot of positions by driving like 95% all the time and reacting appropriately to incidents ahead of me. 

Doing SF last season was pretty consistently a last to like 6th-8th ""challenge"" every race because I just drove within my skills and treated a wreck like the awful thing it is"
"Then you perceive my comment as ""in every situation that happens, you can do something about it"", while it is a reply to a specific situation, in this case ""I've had a DNF multiple races in a row and it is always somebody else his fault"".

You can't do something in every situation, but when it becomes a pattern, it's time to look at yourself."
"Not sure where ypu're gettimg condescending from, I read it as, they've been in many wrecks and therefor know, not pretending they're better, but knowing that they've learnt.
And obviously, we all wreck, and we all have bad days - but fact is, all these posts are waffling about 'ohh i always get wrecked through no fault of my own, everybody is so bad on this platform, why does everybody always turn into me' etc, that's just false and a complete lack of perspective. Fact is, if you're constantly in wrecks, you're either at fault for total lack of skill and awareness, or just maybe in very rare cases, you can't quali for the life of you and are stuck in 300SOF hell. In that case, sure, you can be in many wrecks that aren't your fault, but it's still a skill issue that you ended up there and can't get away"
So you go into a race without practicing or anything? Why?
"Lol I actually did practice! The car doesn't top out in 4th gear unless you're drafting someone. And the few times I WAS drafting with someone, the limiter kept topping out and I thought that was it.

Trust me, I'm not lazy, I'm just an idiot."
Fair enough
"All of the Rudskogen outside curbs are 4-wheel rules, that just only applies to the paved runoff. Grass is half-car off, however. So on the long left-hander in the middle of the lap and the 90-degree left-hander towards the end, there's paved runoff that quickly ends, so you have to make sure you get half the car back on at least the curb by the time the grass starts.

I believe that is a general rule across all tracks: no matter what the rule is for off-track in a turn, grass is always half-car. (Also note that half-car is defined by the center line of your car, so if your car is oversteering, you get less space than you might think because the rear of your centerline is hanging over to the side.)

Watkins is just weird because it's first and foremost a NASCAR track, so track limits reflect that. Except for turn 1 for whatever reason, plus the second-to-last turn which makes no sense at all lol

Most tracks on iRacing now have 4-wheel rules, although in many cases the line they're using to detect it isn't obvious or consistent from track to track. So you kinda just have to figure it out"
"Let me try to give you a summary. 

In most cases in iracing, centerline of the car outside the white line is off track. In some cases (looking at you cota) it is centerline of the car outside the curbing where curbing exists. 

The newer tracks where exceptions are defined, it is (almost) all 4 wheels outside of the defined area. I say almost because it's actually center of the wheels, so you could still have part of a tire in play but get an off track, but this is fine detail stuff. 

So to look at Rudskogen, where exceptions are defined, it is all 4 wheels (almost) outside the *curbing*. So not only is it not the white line in these cases but the more forgiving outside edge of the curbs, but it is based on tires instead of car centerline. Those areas are far far more forgiving than the standard rules."
"Everyone’s comments are correct. One of the biggest things to remember is that the track boundaries aren’t just for penalties, they’re for safety too. If you go to a track day or race in event IRL, those things like track limits are discussed during a drivers meeting or a safety briefing before the track goes hot. Different series have different rules and they can vary track to track.

Sometimes I find myself asking the same question you did when I’m on a new track. I typically resort to the thinking of “okay, if I can’t go wide at “X” where/how can I attack the corner differently to avoid a penalty or area.” 

Great question!!"
"The best bet is to find the limits through trial and error in practice, as you’ll need to learn how bumpy and grippy the kerbs are at different speeds and angles if you want to use them properly.

From memory the red areas are the areas to stay out of"
"For Watkins Glen, most turns use the typical rules of not going past the curbing, so that the road series that use the track get their common rules. But the Carousel exit in the short layout is a NASCAR only turn, so it uses NASCAR rules.

I wish they could have different off-tracks for different layouts, so NASCAR could continue using all of T1 exit without it changing for all the series that run the Boot layout."
Thanks!
"Thanks. Sometimes it seems like a wheel all the way into the grass is an off, and sometimes it does seem like you have a bit more leeway..."
"To be honest, I've never actually been told anything about track limits at any track day in real life. Only which curbs you should not put a wheel on. I think the assumption is that you will break something or lose control if you go beyond the limits...

&#x200B;

But to be fair, the track days here are pretty slipshod when it comes to safety..."
"Yeah, I usually do experiment on the important curbs, but there is no rhyme or reason about the ones you can cut with impunity versus those you cannot…"
Somehow I don't think that the solution to track limits is to introduce even more sets of track limits to learn 
You have to learn each track really. The rules tab is a good starting point but in the end you need to go out and figure them out.
"You need to view tracks as having all come from different eras and so different approaches to the track limits problem. The stuff they've made more recently is much more lenient vs the stuff they scanned and implemented a long time ago. As we get updates and rescans, they change towards the new modus operandi. Some tracks, like le mans,  don't rely on off tracks nearly as much and instead give you slow downs. Some tracks change for the worse (looking at you Imola... thanks Mercedes...)"
"You know what’s funny, I’ve read the sporting code multiple times (including less than a month ago) and I still do not have this achievement.  Hm."
 *Some of you have earned this but don't show it*
My first achievement in iracing✊
Looking at you drivers who think the blue flag means that everyone has to move out of your way like the parting of the red sea.
"iRacing has achievements? Huh, i guess i havent achieved much in it."
Yeah but I read and then repeated what a guy on reddit said another guy on reddit said another guy on reddit said was in the sporting code so…
"I read it front to back before I ran my first race 12 years ago because I was a kid on summer vacation with nothing to do while I waited for my wheel to arrive.


Also autism."
I feel like buying the game on Steam negates this badge.
"![gif](giphy|CAYVZA5NRb529kKQUc|downsized)

OP probably"
"I read it, that's how I know iracing contradicts themselves in there"
99% of people haven’t read it because most people aren’t massive dullards.
I beat two iracing employees. They let me win tho apparently
You guys have this? I dont even know where to read the sporting code
Should be a requirement
Same for the tutorial videos. I watched them all but never got the achievement
Yeah same here.
Same
This is the way
"So this is actually a fluid and typically driver policed situation. On ovals it is usually the highline and the driver simply is to hold their line, or in some cases low line all depends really on the communication between leaders and the lap traffic.

On road with multi class the common practice is the slower paced classed cars are to hold the normal driving and and the quicker paced class of cars pass only when safe to do so. 

Not saying it always does happen though as I have certainly seen slower car get driven through/over by leaders"
One of the achievements is reach 10k iRating lol
Sporting code by telephone game.
I don't have it on Steam and I don't have the achievement either.
"Yeah, it's a complete mystery as to how one gets credit for this.  I'm assuming that OP hacked iRacing."
"It’s a known glitch, if you really want it you can put in a ticket and they will give it to you if you tell them you watched the videos"
Clear your cache and try agian
"Tires i think are around 6secs each. About 24secs total or so ± afew secs.
Not sure how long a full tank is. If by full tank you actually mean the full around 100l tank then the answer would be more than tires. But also very easy to test this"
"To test, would I just go out on a just about empty tank and pull back into the pits and do full fuel? I've never tested this before is the only reason I asked. 
Same with tires? Just choose to swap tires and not do fuel?"
Yep. I'd just back up a few metres set pitstop and go back forward and time it. 
"Exactly, just leave with barely enough fuel to do a lap, then come in. You don't have to time it yourself, just leave the pit as soon as you can and the total pit time will show up on the top of the screen. Mark it down, then come back to only change tires and see how long it takes.

Divide the time it took to do a full fuel by the number of liters to get approximately how long per liter, and then you can use that number to see how many liters of fuel you need to stop for to get a ""free"" tire change."
"Unserved penalties get applied post-race, you should still be listed as the winner"
Submit a protest if he didn’t get a penalty and in fact did get first place. They seem to regularly apply changes to results as a result of protests now.
"There’s no chance he didn’t finish with a black flag. Check the results page, the win should be yours there"
Is there another view of this?
No. You won this. A penalty should have been applied at the end.   If it didn’t.. that’s very odd and you should protest this.
Does anybody actually play Iracing here? Did OP actually race this? The guy missing the bus stop will have a big penalty so nothing bad happened here.
The tension is killing me… did he got a penalty or not. OP commonnnnn tell us
[deleted]
skill issue
He cut the whole bus stop there’s no way he didn’t get a penalty
He then had the audacity to say sorry
We are checking
Yes there is
Exactly why I want another view lol
"ikr!? fuckit, I'm acting-as-if for the guy. congrats G"
"> If he didn’t receive a penalty and you didn’t win that’s unacceptable and makes me second guess even continuing to use the service.

Little drastic, but even if he wasn't given a penalty in game the stewards can alter the final grid now after reviewing the protest."
So you didn't have the win stolen. Check the results. They will automatically assess a penalty if he finished the race without serving the slow down.
"Yeah, that’s my thoughts. The results should show you winning since he should have had a penalty. Don’t let dorks like that ruin your win, my dude! If the results don’t show it, though, definitely submit the protest and they should correct it"
Report it
This got a lol
"That's when you reply ""enjoy your time off"""
My daughter runs around the house saying this now
"Great, that settles it"
You don't even need another view. You can clearly see his headlights point straight across the grass the whole way before he appears in the video.
Apparently not in iRacing yet. They only adjust championship points and I don't know anyone who cares about them.
Thank you I’m so used to forza I forgot iracing usually does it correctly
"Don't do this shit. If you're going to protest them, just protest them. Also, threatening to protest someone, is itself a protestable offense."
"I do need another view to determine how big of a cut it was and understand the lack of a slow down

If this driver didn’t serve their slowdown then OP didn’t get a win stolen."
Drivers that are regularly in top split tend to care more about Championship points. As well as any type of RTP series.
"They adjust championship points and grid placement(s).

*Post-Results Disqualification - A member or team may be Disqualified from a Race or event after Results have 
been posted. Their Championship Points for the Race or event will become 0, and they will drop to a last place 
finish.* 

Thats why OP needs to check the results, he most likely was still given the win because of in of an in game penalty. If not, he needs to protest and the stewards will adjust the grid to reflect him getting a win. I also care about championship points. Not only am I trying to win every race, I want to also win the entire series for the season."
"Also  if they did adjust it, dont forget to get your singed first win certificate!"
"I know, very very rarely have I said this sort of thing but if they're going to be snide about cheating, doubt anything will happen :)

Also hear a LOT of people saying they will report in chats etc, hardly anyone follows the rule really."
Ah ok I didn't realise it was too split.
"thank you for this. I came here to commiserate with OP, as I got intentionally shunted out of my 3rd win yesterday, and he literally drove away from me laughing in the next one.I felt hopeless until I downloaded this certificate from a couple years ago. given that obvious penalty from that would-be win thief, it looks like OP has a reason to smile, and with this pdf, so do I! 

congrats, OP. keep it up, brethren."
"It's interesting, I never got mine :("
"I said that shit ONCE...but a whole bunch times in the race. man was heated, I even made fun of his stupid name. watched the replay afterwards and realized it was a racing incident. woke up the next day with a protest from him. watched the video he submitted and realized that he apologized on his end, but I was talking over him. I apologized to him for being so dumb and to myself for making myself look so dumb. we're friends now."
"Imagion getting multiple wins in a day. Jokes aside, happy that I could cheer you up!

Now I feel terreble as my last win was momths ago XD"
"Aaaw, itbhas to be sonewere, did you check the websites rewards?"
"That's how it goes. I've learnt to keep my head and watch a replay before passing blame. Check out a vid I posted, guy goes nuts and rants, but he just had to make smarter decisions and he would have been fine."
"Didn't know it exists, I'm child of UI."
Where do I go to find rewards?
Me too! But when I found out I downloaded them directly!

"As a road guy, oval crashes are freaking crazy, it's so violent lol. 

Like in road you just spin out and maybe hit the wall, rarely do I see big crashes. 

But in oval, when you crash.. you crash. I love it."
I guess you always qualy on pole and never see the massive crashes in the midfield then lol. I got 2 podiums in IMSA at the Glen just cause I wasn't part of the cluster fuck pileups soon as pacing ended.
Hahaha I'm at the back of the pack but just haven't seen that many violent crashes lol
Why not just create a second account on the windows side and create a second install for iRacing on a different folder or drive. Not sure if that will work or if you can use the same install. Never tried it.
You should be able to share the install. UI login and control configs are stored in the Windows user folder. 
"because logging in and out of windows is more of a hassle than logging in and out of the iRacing UI.

Up until today one account was just logged in via the UI and one via the website. So sessions would just get launched from one or the other depending on which driver was going to be going in. Now it just requires a login/logout from the UI. Not the end of the world but would be nice if made a little simpler.

Kinda like how different social networks have the option of having multiple accounts in the app and you can just swap between them."
Whats the point of two accounts tho?
I understand. Not sure if it helps but 2 windows users can be logged in. Just have to switch on the windows side. The users windows session logged out would still be active(including whatever apps they had open). Just don’t log out and choose switch accounts instead.
"Maybe brother,uncle,dad etc… sharing a PC."
"Yeah, the computer is slow enough as is haha"
Oh duh
"Context really doesn't matter, a rule was broken and you were protested for it. Nothing someone else does can justify a person to break a rule. 

Even if you did protest him for his actions, it wouldn't have saved you in the blocking protest."
"Don't be a vigilante, be a good community member. Protest him and let iRacing crew deal with that."
You felt the need to block the guy because of what he did but not the need to simply send in a protest for it? Lame
"""Blocking"" is very relative in oval racing. 

Holding the racing line and even running a ""protective"" line is not ""blocking"". And since there's no left to right like road courses the racing line is more consistently determined. So *normally* really have to do something pretty blatant on oval for the stewards to agree it's blocking. Like if there was a big speed differential and you still pulled over to block his line or you ""block"" the inside ebut then him try to go outside and then ide up and block there too. The first move and ""protecting"" your line is normally legal but making a second live to a different line to prupsoefully block is usually where it will get called on you. 

Every incident in iracing is unique. You weren't involved in the start so it's hard to say it was ""retaliation"" on your part even though you somewhat admit here that it was. 

But you do seem admit that you did in fact ""block"". So without seeing a video I can't comment if the ""right"" call was made. But if you admit you did it and got protested for it then it just is what it is. On his part it seems extremely petty if there was no contact and he was still able to go on and win the race."
Those sure are a lot of words to say you intentionally broke the rules and got just punishment for it.
"I think the takeaway I get from this post is you should just protest people instead of letting stuff slide. You probably wouldn't feel so bad if your protest against him had been successful, even though he also protested you, right?"
Don't retaliate. Either let it go or protest. Even keep the verbal and typed rebukes to a minimum or none at all.
"I know youre getting flamed in here a bit but im with you. Its annoying when someone roughs other people up but instantly slams the protest button when people do anything back.

I know retaliation is like a big no no. But sometimes its tough seeing people just get away with things and no consequences."
[removed]
Yep sure sounds like you blocked him.
"Don't block. It's that simple.

The rules are rules."
[removed]
"I do agree, and I'm not upset at iRacing for the situation, it's more an issue with a driver knowing he caused the situation then having the mindset to file a protest for something so minor after he knows he wrecked half the field."
"Lesson learned, I guess. I usually would only protest if I 100% knew it was intentional, in this case, there was a bit of doubt that he was maybe just a bad driver. So I just wanted to show a bit of displeasure. It's obviously my bad in the end lol i ended up with cake on my face and he ended up with a win."
"I mean, showing the guy I'm a little unhappy is easier than filing a protest to be fair. I'm not going to file on him a week later just because he filed on me either."
"Yeah, I'm not arguing the block. Really, I'm more upset with the pettiness. And i think iRacing agree its a block because i did actually get some damage from the start wreck. The reason I'm upset is that in the protest it says that the other guy is quoted as saying ""he blocked me due to being upset with his race situation"" like he's not 100% aware of what he did, just rubs me the wrong way. If i wreck someone and they show a little frustration with me afterward, I just accept it, as long as they don't take me out or damage my car I find it's just a part of racing."
"Where did i disagree with my punishment? I'm upset with the mindset of a guy reporting a minor block by someone after taking them and 11 other guys out before the race even went green. If you wrecked half the field before the green and one of the guys slowed you up for less than half a second a few laps later, you're gonna report him? I think almost every racer would have a ""yeah, i guess, i deserved that"" attitude and carry on no?"
"I mean, sure. Its more that i think racers should take accountability for what they themselves do aswell. Personally, I'm not reporting a guy for slowing me up a bit after I just wrecked a bunch of them with a non racing move, i feel like I'd understand that they are a little upset with me."
"Yeah. Lesson learned the hard way, unfortunately."
"That's all I'm really trying to say. He ruined a dozen guys races before the race even started, and all he got in return was a tenth or 2 taken off one of his laps, and he still felt the need to protest it. It's just a little frustrating."
"Thanks for the insight, but i am currently wearing a shirt and long pants while crying thank you very much."
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
People not taking accountability for their actions is unfortunately nothing new in iRacing.
I’m curious how did you block him in oval?  Most people would just run you over if you dove down in front of them.
"Retaliation is specifically against the rules in iRacing. 

I totally get where you’re coming from and filing a protest after doing something stupid is shitty but… at the end of the day so is trying to “punish” a badly behaving driver on-track. 

Just out of curiosity, what was the penalty for your successful protest?"
I think you need to focus less on what other people are doing and more on what you actually have control over.
Or racing in general. Or life.
"Yeah, like I said, I'm not really arguing that the protest was successful. That's fine. I did block, it's more the pettiness of it, the protest said that he claims that i was ""blocking because I was unhappy with my race"" not that he wrecked 12 cars before the race started. It just rubbed me the wrong way."
"I just took his line in 1 and part of 2 purposely. He was already the last car on lead lap, so he just slowed down a bit, then i pulled out of the way. It's tough to pass at Indy, so i just didn't let him. Like i said, punishment is deserved based on sporting code. Just seems petty of him to report."
"Seems like it was just a warning/strike on my account. With a don't do it again message. Nothing too serious, so I'm not overly upset about that part. Was just frustrated with the fact that the other driver knew what he did and bothered to file a protest for such a minor response. I get that what I did was illegal, so from iRacing perspective, I'm fine with it. I guess I'll just have to start protesting people instead of showing that I'm upset with them."
Maybe one petty turn deserves another and his was the second one?
"Yeah, I mean that’s 100% the move going forward. No good comes from “showing you’re upset”, for anyone."
The LMP3 is the hardest to drive of the bunch.  By a large margin.
"I haven't driven the LMP3, but I would say the LMP2 is the opposite of Stockholm syndrome. It drives so good, feels so alive, super responsive; every time I do Pcup or GT3, I always go back to LMP2 because they feel so dead in comparison. It makes me not even want to try GTP or LMP3"
Mount Panorama is much more suited to the car. Try it this week.
I actually really enjoy the way the LMP3 drives. I didn’t find it difficult to handle. Maybe it’s because I mostly drive prototypes but learning how to drive it came to me pretty fast relative to other cars.
"The LMP3 is just fucking awesome to drive. I really feel with that car more than any other on iRacing, that I have tried, that you can really hustle the car to get more pace out of it"
"I love the lmp3 as well, some other fun challenging cars/classes i could recommend are GTE/GT1/SR10"
"To piggy back off this, the LMP2 is almost too easy to drive compared to other prototypes"
"And it's been praised by drivers who have driven it IRL for its accuracy. 

Makes the ""dentist moments"" in IMSA make more sense. "
The LMP3 feels like it wants to hurt you. It 100% ups the intensity and you HAVE TO FOCUS or it will find the nearest wall. But I am finding I enjoy that compared to like the gt3 where it's just easy honestly. given what you and others say I probably will skip the LMP2 and maybe try the GTP at some point. Who knows I might be a LMP3 lifer haha
I enjoyed Rudskogen. It was just very not easy haha. Getting up and down the mountain feels so damn good when you get through there with some real speed. This is going to be a hell hole in the multi class race. I can't wait ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
"I find that people just come into it and try to push it too hard and it bites them. 

It really doesn't like hard braking, just wants you to be pretty smooth "
When you get it right in this car you feel like a rockstar. I love it
"Oof, I hated it. So many slow to medium downhill, coasting, downshifting corners in a car that feels like a snowplow in slow/ medium corners. Stockholm Syndrome is about right. It was brutal.

I don’t like Bathurst. I think it is highly overrated, but it is a breath of fresh air after Rudskogen. At least you can take advantage of the aero.

You are right though. Even though the car may be more fun to drive. It will be a bloodbath in multiclass. Stockholm Syndrome strikes again for the second week in a row, I guess.

At least I’ll drive this one a few times…"
"Rudskogen was terrible on the fixed set up series. Had to go to the open set up multi class series if you wanted to actually be able to drive the car and not just survive. Bathurst has been pretty fun, its the first time I have ever ran on it, and I can see why people like it. The mountain section is very fun, but that feels like a do not attempt to pass zone haha."
"Yeah, that’s why I don’t like it. There will be completely blocked track on the mountain sometimes. I love to hotlap it. I just don’t like racing it. Doesn’t feel like racing when you come to a parking lot with no way through."
Just keep driving as usual with a bit more awareness and avoid any aggressive moves. Afterwards just protest against that Driver. Thats it.
"There are 2 ways for me :

1. If i'm faster i'll just keep drive and will win

2. If i'm not or we have close pace i'll let him pass and will start show myself in every corner till he spun or hit the wall trying not give me any space"
"In Road? Keep my distance, more often than not they will take themselfs out and if I'm lucky a couple more people. That's free real estate. 

In Oval and Dirt stuff? I'm a mirror. I race you the way you race me."
"I don’t tend to see that many honestly, but when I do I try and let them get on with it. Life’s too short to get involved, if they want to try and ram me off the road for 11th they clearly have issues at home."
"I've been thinking about this, had a guy blocking me at the Roar down the straights because I was quicker and running a slippery set up, I think next time I have that issue, I leave my nose in and let him pit himself, oops!"
I'll put them in the bed with the Captain's daughter. Or maybe shave their belly with a rusty razor.
File protests and got those mf ban
"Gonna get downvoted, again. But I move them in the braking zone by pushing them off the racing line to the outside of the corner, get past them and move on with my race. 

It’s commonly called a bump and run.

If you want to see how it’s done google Shane Van Gisbergen / Will Brown incident V8 Supercars Sydney 2023."
"I had that issue last night at Spa in the advanced Mazda series. Dude threw more blocks than a room full of toddlers. An unsafe rejoin in the final chicane would have taken two of us out, were it not for the fact that we both predicted that he would do it based on our experience over the previous 30 minutes.

Unfortunately, his pace was close enough to mine, and I had just enough aero damage (thanks to rear-ending him due to a block in the braking zone) that I couldn't keep a lead if I managed to get by him. I've never intentionally wrecked anybody in my years on iRacing, but last night, I found it hard not to.

In this situation, keep it cool, don't retaliate. As others have said, stick your nose in, try to force mistakes. Make mental notes of the incidents and file protests. I filed four against that guy last night, which is usually 2-3 months worth of protests for me."
"Drive carefully, avoid contact until the end, review the recording, and if it’s egregious enough, save the recording and report."
"Let them go. If you're faster than them, that's fine you'll pass them. If you're slower or more evenly matched, just stay behind. They inevitably wreck themselves out."
I try not to attribute to malice which that can be easily explained by incompetence. Let them pass and wait for them to take themselves out.
"I am very defensive when dealing with aggressive drivers. But I employ a “three strikes and you’re out” policy. If you are aggressive with me and make me take action to stop us both from wrecking, I’ll give you two times. But the third, I will send you. And it will look like an accident. 

Coming up on 15 years, zero successful protests."
"They’ll either rage quit or DQ, so just let it happen."
"Depends, if I’m topping up on some safety rating usually I’ll just follow until the wreck themselves as it’s inevitable. If I’m truly racing as long as I’m not in a fragile car I’ll race as normal and allow them to pit maneuver themselves on me."
I let them pass waiting for them to do something stupid ( they always do ) then I take my spot back.
Protest the Forza drivers
99% of the time these guys will fuck up their own race. Be patient and wait for them to do it.
Pretty sure I was in this lobby while he didn’t hit me I clipped 3 videos of him driving dirty and submitted them as a protest
I try to do the same it gets sketchy on tracks with tight braking zones though. I don't want them to send me to the shadow realm.
"It’s the worst when people who are clearly faster than me, are also clearly worse drivers."
100%  Those are correct ways.
"I always let the aggressive ones go, then just fill
Their mirrors up for a few laps and it usually takes care of itself."
"But what if you come across another mirror?? Are you racing yourself, or no one?"
I guess I'm hard headed lol when I see it the last thing I want is for them to get the joy of winning ill keep poking it on the inside until they make a mistake or spin off
Sounds like something that should be done early in the morning.
You NASCAR guys still don't know how to pronounce that Kiwis name huh?
Google almost anything by Jason Plato. The BTCC master of bump and run
"I've been on iRacing for about 5 weeks. After 3 weeks of frustration, about 2 weeks ago I started doing this no matter the driver. The results have been my SR going from D 2.2 to D 3.9 and my IR from 480-\~700. I'm objectively not great, but I pass so many people just driving consistently and not wrecking. I'm still racing hard and pushing to the best of my ability, not farming SR, and just found that its so much better than whatever the hell I was doing to start."
"This is why I goat them into spending more rubber then me.

Even in a rookie race, if you preserve your tires, and make them spend theirs every turn  they will over heat and spin them selfs or make a big opening. 

This is not illegal, its their own choice to eat the bait you create. Ans if they spin or open up  they can't blame you as it's their mistake for doing that.

Also, trying to preserve your tires in general is a good skill in actual duels to have with Good racers"
"If you're driving a car with brakelights, it's a good tactic to ride the brakes juuuust a bit early, in case you have such a guy behind you.
They'll see your lights go on an will most likely react a bit earlier than they would if you brake hard on the marker. 
For everything else, there is a mirror."
"What answer are you looking for?

You can’t magically teleport them off the track

Are you looking for insight or are you just here to bitch lol

You can control yourself and your car and your actions you can’t control what someone else is going to do. Try to race your best as cleanly as possible but if someone decides they want to ruin your race sometimes there’s nothing you can do"
I do the same im not the best driver but I’ll let em by and wreck the guy ahead of me or spin out in their own.
Then you're racing infinity
„Why is my iRating so low and why is everyone crashing me out all the time?“ 😢
No just a typo. Corrected (hopefully).
"> I pass so many people just driving consistently and not wrecking

You will be shocked at how far you will get by just doing this. "
"Correct me if I’m wrong I’m asking cause I’ve always had this doubt. Overheating tires is possible but Tire degradation is not applicable in rookie races right? And even if someone drives by understeering a few corners every lap the amount of additional heat generated in the tires wouldn’t drastically affect handling, would it? (I’m talking about the Mazda as that’s the only car I race)"
"This, into the first few turns of Lap 1 of any race its very useful. Helps from everyone bunching way up"
"I have learned you can actually create tires with substantial less grip then your opponent. I learned this by this trick being done to me.

I saw that after 3 to 4l5 laps(depents on the track, lime Rock its 4 for example)  you can lose alot of grip if you mess up t1, t2 t4/5 you will get out gripped in 4 laps noticeably.

After a few more and you need to brake way earlyer for t1 wich creates oppetrunity for overtaking g. So forcing them to defend strange lines they are not used too, or driver harder then they should, then you can over heat/degradation their tires."
"It definitely is applicable. And yes, the effect of overheating CAN drastically effect handling. Overheating the tires requires under driving for a bit to reset. these drivers and never doing that, so every mistake is like adding fuel to a fire that just keeps getting bigger. My #1 method for overtaking is simply to stay behind them, brake early and drive smoothly, but make it look like I'm trying to pass, and make fake moves. They will overheat trying to ""defend"". Wait for the slip and make an easy pass. "
I didn’t know this. Thanks for the explanation mate!
I actually never thought of these in my races. Will definitely apply. Thank you!
"Hell, if your ever find upur self on a oval, this is the way to pass on any short track.dive low and soft, then high and soft, and once their tires are warm, you just slide under them like butter"
Man that’s the thing. Ovals are very very interesting to me. But i have absolutely no idea about how they work. I love wheel to wheel racing and ik Ovals provide that. But I’m very hesitant to even run a race cause I don’t wanna wreck anyone. If there are any beginner tips you got for oval I would love them. I’m not from the US so I don’t really know how they work please don’t mind that.
"I am from the nederlands. So 0 ovals here. But I got sone good tips.

1 ride street stock. Easy, stable and controleble cars on nice and simple short tracks, and one big boy race on charlote

2 take it easy. Tire wear is real there. Brake to hard  ypu will be slow the rest of the race. Steering too much, slow. 

3 pick a line. Don't go up and down the lines. 1 bad for your tires and 2 just plain rude. It's like blocking.

4 you will get clowned on, you will spin out and crash. That's all part of the process. Even if you get lapped, let it happen. There are no blue flags but let the leaders pass under you.

5 don't try and win in the first 20 laps, try to stay close to the leaders and keep up, far more important. Cause a crash will happen at some point. And if your at c level, that means full course yellow aka cheap pits and the field back together

6 have fun"
"The other commenter explained it really well, but isn't the US where there is the most ovals?"
"Don't worry, they're going to wreck you."
Great tips man thank you!
"Kinda. Excluding weight transfer and aero and such they always have the same amount of grip available. It is true that you typically want as wide of an arc as possible to keep up speed, most of the time there are exceptions of course.
Grip is only partly a role. But the faster you go the less you can steer without going over the available grip the tires have and when you go over then the car will be turning less and scrubbing speed"
"Personally I wouldn’t say “less steering angle = more grip = faster”, rather “less steering angle = induce less understeer/oversteer = faster”… but that’s really semantics, the important thing is just knowing you want to limit the steering angle."
"Look up ""slip angle"", its a bell curve so too little steering produces little to no slip angle which is slow, too much steering produces too much slip angle which causes understeer and is also slow.  The sweet spot in between produces the most amount of grip and is fastest.  Usually this angle is less steering input than most people would think.  So how do you corner with less steering? By rotating the car with the rear tires.  How much slip from the rear tires becomes too much? Same story, too much slip angle causes oversteer.  The fastest way to drive is to balance your front and rear tire slip angles through a corner to be on the limit just before understeer/oversteer occurs."
"its cool that you’re asking this question. a lot of people dont even try to think about it to this extent! go look at some videos from suellio almeida where he explains all sorts of things about grip, braking, cornering, slip angle, etc

he helped me to understand this stuff a lot more :)"
Have you gone through the iRacing driving school? This discuss it in detail there
"If your tires are squealing, it is as if you are stepping on the brake."
"Yes, that's the basis of the basic racing line through a single corner. The faster you are going, the less you're able to steer the car (if you go through a corner too fast, you will understeer).

The bigger the radius of the corner, the faster you are able to go through it. That means you can brake less, go through carrying more speed, and exit at a higher speed allowing you to go through the next straight faster.

That's only the basis though. Cars with aero behave differently, and chaining multiple corners together means you can't always have that perfect wide radius."
"https://youtu.be/0A7pTrlSy34?si=v1ACWQI2mfZXMk4c

This video has all the answers you need, explained by a pro driver and coach.

Watch that, it helped me a lot to improve my understanding and gain more speed."
Race driving 101: https://youtu.be/6-sGV2XXUeU?si=HT3Ox-acK2xeDyDn
"There are more fundamental driving techniques that need to be done properly that lead to using the appropriate steering angle for a specific turn. If you just try to turn the wheel less, it's not going to make you go faster.

Lastly, setup has a big influence on this, especially for cars where the steering ratio and tire caster can be adjusted."
"Track goes right so I crank it right. Right?
The F1 series taught me to only turn the wheel as much as I need to. Depends on the corner I guess. I have a lot to learn"
"When applying aero do the same rules apply, taking the widest arc as possible to keep from scrubbing speed? I'm just starting to drive the F4 after coming from the vee and 1600"
No that makes much more sense thank you lol
"That's the word I was thinking of!  

Thank you for such a detailed explanation"
"Yeah thanks I love learning and asking questions in the best way to do so. 

I'll check it out, thanks."
"Ugh dude so much clicked for me watching him go through a coaching session. It talked about using the brakes to rotate the car more, or inducing oversteer. Which creates keep more minimum speed, by braking less but using it to move the weight of the car you can keep more speed through the corner. Ugh it just clicked lol"
I like to think they sing when your on the limit and scream when you cross it.
"I thought about this more and did some practice laps applying what you said, a lot clicked for me"
"See that's what I'm not really taking into account as I'm just learning to drive the F4 after coming from the vee/1600. As you slow down, less aero means less grip, which means you you lose minimum corner speed right?"
"Love Driver61, I actually use the garage app as my main telemetry. Missed this video, thanks."
"I love this era and style of video, omg yes."
"Yeah, even mostly in the high downforce cars will want to do this even more than let's say high powered gt cars. Mostly exceptions will be things like chicanes."
"agreed, he is really weirdly good at making complex concepts understandable! i bought his book and have been reading it on and off when I have free time, just taking in little bits at a time so i dont cram it all and remember nothing!"
"Exactly, there is a balance to be found with your speed, and going to F4 after the Vee requires a lot of new learning."
"Ugh my nemesis corners. I love em, but boy are they tough. Especially the one at SPA, the second to last turn."
"Tbh I should probably go back to the Vee and 1600 as I spent only 2 weeks driving pretty much everyday all day for two weeks. I'm usually at the bottom of the top splits in those cars and have tons of room for improvement. 

However, the F4 is just so much more fun to drive. I love the aero and how grippy it is, so I said screw it and decided to jump right in."
Probably because Arca races road courses irl?
"They usually do one a season. Brake early and ease on the gas coming off the corners and it might help. Road courses in the ARCA car are tricky, but if you can keep it on the course and off the walls, you should get a decent finish. I hope that helps."
"ARCA races on road courses as well as ovals. The good news is, it will only affect your Road license iRating. Worse case, use it as a Drop Week. 

Also, slow down, like wayyyy down."
"The NASCAR series typically go to 1 or 2 Road Courses a season.

Stockcars on road are a real challenge that’s completely different from traditional road series. You have to take it very easy to control the car because it’s not made to race on road courses. 

Focus on just running a lap, even if it’s 15 seconds off pace. Brake super early, easy on throttle, no quick steering movements. After that, you can start worrying about gaining speed."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St8iEpkcDJc
Trucks are at Willow Springs as well. Stock cars on road courses are probably my favorite combo.
I'll gladly take this week off from ARCA. Plus I couldn't cross into Canada to race anyway since my passport expired.
"The best way to learn is to build up speed. You want to calibrate your driving so that when you make a mistake you go slow, not crash. You do this by going REALLY slow around the track, braking super early, not using full throttle. You gradually lap by lap go just a teeny tiny little bit faster. 

If you try to learn by going fast, crashing, resetting, you're going to get in the habit of going faster than your skills allow you to go. From what I've seen with oval cars on road courses, staying on the track the entire race will get you really great results.

Lastly, these cars are super hard to drive on road courses. If you're not already familiar with road racing it's even harder. Don't get yourself down about not doing well, just go slow and get familiar, you'll get there."
Embrace it and get good lol. Typical road series are all boring compared to stock cars on road. Idk any other car that's as exciting.
"Embrace the suck, I absolutely love ARCA at road courses. 

Just a pro tip, if you think you’re going slow enough, you’re not. Go slower."
"Forums explain it all, they do one road course, and a certain number of large and small ovals each season"
Stock cars haters in absolute shambles over this comment
How many drop weeks do I get? I'm going to be missing most of week 10 and 11 because I'll be in daytona?
"It's pretty mixed for me, I love the next gen at indy Road but hate all stocks on cota, I guess it depends."
How many off weeks can I take? I'm going to the daytona 500 and will miss that week because I'll be away from my computer.
Your best 8 weeks of points are scored for the season.
Sucks to be you!  😀
"What do  you mean by drop weeks? Are you in serious contention for a championship. If you are its four but very few people really go for championships.

Are you worried about participation credits, if thats the case its still four but I decided a long time it's really not worth stressing over the 4 dollars and running stuff I don't want to."
Thanks
What do you like to drive?
"I'm not on road much, but I've wanted to be able to run GT3s. If I ran that race I'd be more careful than I usually am with what I usually run"
Sounds like usb problem possibly are you using a hub with buttkicker audio?
"I had a similar issue that seemed to be fixed by a bios update on my MB and firmware update of my soundcard. However, I did both back to back so I don't know which was the issue, but no more crashes for me in iRacing since then!"
"Sorry I can’t be of help but didn’t realise iRacing had a built in butt kicker thing. I use sim hub atm (as originally set it up for AC) but going to look at that, thanks."
Thanks everyone for the help!! Issue solved!
You should use Simhub anyway. Much more customizations. And apparently more stable too.
It was indeed. I had my headphone bluetooth adapter and my butkicker usb conected to the same USB hub. Aparrently iracing and the PC does not like that. I moved the headphone dongle to a USB directly on the PC and the issue is fixed! Thanks for you answer!
Soundcard driver is likely the problem.  Pull the driver from the motherboard support website (assuming using the onboard audio chipset).
"It does but if you already have simhub working like you like, its way better imo."
Will give it a try!
"Re-run the calibration in the settings menu. Pretty sure it's the top right of the screen, where the wheel and pedals are shown."
What wheel? The thrustmasters have a button to swap the brake and throttle or maybe throttle and clutch. It’s possible you hit that?
I tried that a bunch I’ve got it working again by doing some real fucked shit that I don’t even understand lol I’m not entirely sure how I fixed it tbh
It’s fixed now thanks I don’t know what I did but it fixed it
I have really enjoyed participating in this league. Very welcoming community and fun to race!
"Very fun league and group of people to race with and against. I joined back when it was F3 and this was my first league experience. Even as a mid-fielder there are fun battles. I know leagues aren’t for everyone, but if you’re looking for a welcoming group of people to share this hobby with on Saturdays or want to try league racing out for the first time, you’ll find a good group of people here imo"
"Sounds like VSCA. Some of my teammates wanted to compete in it last year, they voiced some concerns about the rules prior to the first race and got banned as well. Lol"
"Raced last season with my usual team. Was going great. Had some issues with the admins for the first few races that weren’t anything to do with us but noticed some dictatorship qualities taking over. The racing was good so looked past it. Enter a race where we ended up winning a close fight. Over 24 hours after the race ended on a holiday, we were given a penalty for someone almost hitting us after the race ended but not hitting us and effected nothing in the results. They gave us a huge penalty dropping us to fifth. Gave us no change to protest it as it was on a holiday. All we wanted was credit for the win and deduct our points but that was a no go. Admins gave us no opportunity to answer and straight up told us that even if we had seen the “email” within 10 minutes or whatever it was, they would not have changed the result. Good racing and wish I found an IMSA series in that design but it was ruled more like the FIA on steroids then IMSA."
"Sounds like em. Raced that league in 2021. Did the Daytona 24, where we got 4 bs penalties with no explanation given whatsoever as to why we got the penalties. Been an avid hater since."
The league sounds like an HOA for gaming. No thanks.
VSCA have been clowns forever
"This league is a joke. They change the rules as they please and arbitrarily enforce them. I would not recommend joining this league. 

They claim to be transparent yet most decisions go their way. The admin even have their own teams in the league and it’s obvious they get decisions in their favour."
"Dont know anything about how they handle these cases, so I wont be commenting that. BUT the way they schedule their races with same time as iRacing specials is quite strange and honestly enough for me to stay out."
You’re not the first. I got a drive through pen once and then had a chat with the race directors after my stint. Confirmed what I could do next time and they gave us another penalty for what they said was within the rules! After the race we got banned…
"Sounds about right, bunch of clowns at VSCA"
Not the only one with similar situations! Thankful we got out last year
I've also been permanently banned from VSCA. The admins of that league are power-hungry clowns.
"Based on the comments below, it sounds like it's time to make a new VSCA."
"Unrelated, but still kinda related. I follow the spec e46 series and once a year the series holds a round table to discuss rule changes. One change recommended last year was where the racers can get the ECU programmed. Current rules only allows for one company, who happened to be friends of the series creator. A lot of people wanted a cheaper option. No luck because they stated the company could be trusted and thus prevented cheating. So I proposed the question, how do we know the top teams are not cheating since a hash check against the ECU program is not part of scrutineering. They shut down the conversation immediately and disregarded all opinions on the matter.

The moral of the story is, the creators of the series have a vested interest in making sure things go their way, not yours."
Yeah easy to never interact with them. Sound like a bunch of losers
"I remember during the first season i asked about doing the sprint races that IMSA does (long beach, Detriot) and was told it was a stupid idea by the orgs. They proceeded to add them the very next season -\_-"
"haha, we considered, but got a bad vibe and opted to pass. BUT some people like the structure in their lives…."
"The refund without asking seems like they’re even aware on some level of consciousness that they’re cunts.

Bullet dodged.  "
Internet children with God complexes.
The admin uses AI face for their pfp.
This isn't surprising to me honestly. Dealt with some issues with their admin leading up to the initial season and we pulled due to it. One of the we dealbreakers we ran into was an assumption of malice on our end from their admin squad about team entry rules - something simple that could have been resolved in a five minute conversation that was made much more of a deal than it needed to be.
"Sounds like they did you a favor. If they can't take constructive criticism or comment on their rules, then you're probably better off not being part of the league"
"since im banned myself i can agree that they dont take criticism very well. but FOR THE SKILL LEVEL its a fun league . fcy procedures have gone from being ok to straight painful and there is a lack of transparency regarding admin entering there own teams and the on track conduct of those teams. the driver time  equation is only 1 of the issues that they have but it is one that some  gtd  exploited last year to to gain a few good results, but that loophole was closed after the fact and buried in silence. i spoke up once or twice that i probably shouldnt have but i own my mistakes and im happy not competing in this league . we are the only team to have won all three championships so far so it's not a bad time to say goodbye and best wishes."
"there are many leagues out there. just say bye and don't look back. You don't have to suffer for someone else's sick arrogance being. 

here are a few leagues you may want to participate

Vsca smells like fish
They did you a favor.
No idea what VSCA is. But it sounds toxic. Why doesn't anyone put up with it?
"Don't beat you up about that.  
I got a lot of times in hot waters, because I pointed out flaws, grey-areas and inconsistencies in rule books or rulings during/after the race.

As a tip for the next time: Discuss that with RC privately first, when they don't change it or say that it is not a problem, discuss it publicly.  
And then try to take advantage of it and/or protest teams that overlooked the rule (maybe get other teams to protest you).  
Then they have to rewrite the rule."
"Most of these online leagues are run by mini megalomaniacs. When you think about it why would anyone go to the hassle of doing something like this otherwise.

You basically play by their rules and don't complain. It's not a democracy and it's not fair. Also don't go wheel to wheel with the organizer or their friends either. :-)

Although the flipside is they also don't have time to deal with everyone who thinks they have a problem."
Check out iRTES in cmsracing.com
the admins have their own teams and they are so clearly biased towards them. its a clown show over there and will ban anyone with even the smallest remarks to unfairness or inconsistency of rules
Sounds like a pathetic league with rigged admins
"Clowns. I’m permanently banned too!

https://preview.redd.it/xgu3sx3pztcc1.png?width=1984&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ebecc69e0ccb7cd20b599b731acb3041b6ba12b

Check this out. They changed a rule so one of their organisers (who compete in the league) doesn’t get a penalty.

Absolute joke, surprised not classed as fraudulent as people are paying money for this."
"I just watched some F1 documentary yesterday where they mentioned this. I believe it caused a rule change. I am sorry, I was not paying close attention, it was just on. I do for sure remember this being mentioned though."
"how do I sign up?

sounds like a lot of sensitive sallys getting the boot. lol"
"But, isn't that what all leagues are?  A bunch of losers that can't compete in the real servers, so they setup a league where they can kick anyone that doesn't let them win.  

They are the same people that complain that they get taken out in every race by other people.  It's always the other people that are wrong and never them."
"Another reason in my ten years of racing, I've never joined a league."
"This league for Safety car and Slow drivers only, my Advice don't join this league,  
If you got above 4250 they will not let you drive,  
The League is 1 year, each month 1 race, and you have to be bellow 4250 !!!"
"Buddy you quit the league

https://preview.redd.it/3nvs2w28vncc1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52a8496f8ba56bb3967fc3fb22fd465d8f04f207"
"you quit because you whined about the rules, they told you the rules are the rules, and then you tried to play the lawyer card and demanded your money back and you rage quit

seems like a you problem

the rules there are labyrinthine and endless but they are written and they are accessible. get wrecked, keep coping etc etc"
"You withdrew your entry.  Why would you want to still be a member of their discord or website?

VSCA has some quirks that I disagree on but overall has been good IMO.  It's easy to critique but I don't envy the workload those guys took on.  Certainly beats the hell out of the official endurance events where someone crashes you and you're done."
"I have driven in the VSCA for 3 years and it is a very well run league. The issue is some of the drivers act like it's an official open session and it's not. The vsca is doing everything they can to stop their races from being a disaster of a crash fest. I have also read all of the discord messages. At the end of the day, you and everyone else have had to acknowledge and accept that you have read and fully understand the rules. You did not meet the minimum drive time according to their calculation procedure and you got penalized for it. There's no argument against that."
"You didn’t get banned, you left because a rule didn’t go your way.."
"I know nothing of VSCA or whatever so they could be totally shit for all I know...  
  
But if you're trying to give your slowest driver the minimum time, couldn't you just not use them at the start, that way they get credit for a lap they didn't actually drive when they cross the line on pit exit during their first lap in the car at the start of their stint?  
  
Alternate answer: qualify better if you want that luxury?"
But if your stall is before the finish the next driver will get an extra lap credited so it evens out
sounds like its run by a 12 yo
"We got rejected because of our team name (Track Limit Racing). We were told this was a joke name and not allowed ... 

We then submitted again with an abbreviation (TLR) and this was then rejected again...

We just virtually walked away at that point."
[deleted]
"What an absolute joke, you should expose them and post about that. That is clear corruption, definitely trying to sway the results"
"Last year they took a win away from my team at Road America by enforcing a rule that didn't exist.

A couple days after, they then put in the rule they enforced, proving they had no good reason to enforce it at the time."
"Our team joined their first season, and one of my teammates was a sponsor. Long story short, they kept changing their rules and paint requirements, which meant that we loaded into the race with the wrong number. They gave no warning of this and just kicked everyone who didn't have the correct number on their car. This was the Daytona 24, and we had spent months preparing for this race, learning the rules, and so on. The admins had a mess on their hands, and the discord was blowing up. They more or less had ZERO F's given and a bunch of teams left.  They didn't seem to care as they had a waiting list. I tried to help them and give constructive feedback, and I was banned as well. 

So, needless to say, I'm not surprised to read this first post. They suck and we even had an IMSA driver on our roster who was blown away by how the rules were written. 

It's sad because the concept is so cool, but they just don't care about what other teams say. The admins are originally from ARVA, so that is why I believe they think they're more leet than anyone else."
"I'm pretty sure I know the incident you're referencing.  If so, it's because you passed and then blocked the 2nd place LMP2 team that was still on the white flag lap with the LMP2 leader less than 3 seconds up the road."
"I read that as ""Horn of Africa"" by habit.

I'm sorry, but what's the HOA you're referring to? I feel really old and out of touch now...."
Was not aware admins had teams.
Transparently biased is still transparent tbf
"Same. It would take one hell of a special league for me to not do an iRacing-ran special event. And from what I'm seeing here, and have heard in the past, these clowns are from from worth it. Why would I want to do a worse ran version of an event?"
They are at the same time to prevent the mentality of oh well i'll attempt something stupid and if it doesn't work out i'll just join the next session. That's the main issue with public sessions and why there's so many crashes because can always just race again in an hour.
man we need to start a poll of how many people have been banned from vsca/.. i was thinking i was one of the only ones
That sounds to me like they were cheating. Did you ever notice someone catching up a little to well on the straights? Like a draft effect working a little too well?
"the refund was not without asking, OP started hollering about how he's a lawyer so they gave him the money back instead of dealing with the headache"
"I don't follow that logic oO.

I would consider the cunt move to actually be keeping the money. Or did we just get reverse uno'd?"
"Ok, weird. But what does that have to do with anything tho? ^^"
"Tbh, this is true to some extent. While there are passionate people who create clans and leagues and guilds, there's a definitive point in their evolution where they turn from just a bunch of passionate people having a good time to assholes who jerk each other off.

Have been gaming for nearly 20 years now and every Clan, VA, VTC, guild I've ever been turned into shit after a few years and a few hundred members."
They're always breaking their own rules to help the other admins. Disappointed but not surprised to see that continue
"This is quite recent, so presume 2023. Screenshot from another source within the server, not from me. I obviously have no access to this. I’ve never even raced in this league and already banned. Bunch of jokers"
Was that the roar that just happened or in 2023?
"It was the Michael Schumacher penalty at Silverstone. He was able to serve it on the last lap. 

VSCA would have just banned Michael Schumacher."
Abu Dhabi ‘21?
I’ve only been on iRacing for about 6 weeks but did my first league race last night. Was a lot of fun. I would highly recommend it if you can find a chill league that suits you.
Which is 95% of the player base.  You sound elitist.
you finished low down in the order at the roar and were penalized for breaking a clearly written rule during FCY
Yeah he literally said that in the post…
U no read gud???
"Yeah and then they banned me from ever coming back again.

Because you can withdraw your entry for the race and be relegated to the wait list….its not an indication you’re quitting the league.
">At the end of the day, you and everyone else have had to acknowledge and accept that you have read and fully understand the rules.

problem is they just enforce the rules when they feel like it. I've been in that league and the amount of times there is a communal cluster fuck and they've just decided to let everyone off is ridiculous. When people point out genuine irregularities they get really really arsey and just say oh ma gawd the ruuules must be enforced.   


They're trying their best, the problem is their best is shit. Really poorly run league."
Found the VSCA admin.
"Did I now?

Not the point. The point is getting banned for pointing out a flaw in the rules.
Not if you need to meet minimum drive time when a caution comes out.
God I wish I could throw receipts on it. It’s been probably about like 8-9 months since it happened. My friend who was acting team manager doesn’t have them saved anymore. We were also removed from the discord. We were gaining a nice lead in points at this time of the season but didn’t feel we would respect further race control decisions after the handling. Anything could’ve happened but it definitely ensured a team wouldn’t take over the points lead at that stage of the season.
I wish I kept receipts over it but it’s been about 8-9 months. Honestly never realized how big VSCA was in this category until leaving and seeing them referenced on reddit quite often😂need another IMSA style series
What is ARVA
"We passed them as we crossed the finish line and were only ahead of them at the time by inches. There is zero way to know we did not pass them with that close of a gap. Nothing in iRacing tells us they’re on a lap. They locked up the brakes into a turn where our driver went minimally slower. They were not even close to contact being made. They were not close to the leader whatsoever and had no chance to pass them. We were at T4/5 at Long Beach depending how they count the fountain. The LMP2 leader was on the back straight at that time. We didn’t even ask for the points back. All we wanted to be credited for the win. This was over 24 hours after the race finished on a holiday with no chance to protest and told they wouldn’t change their call no matter what was shown. That long after the race with the winning car, the ending result from just a lock up should factor in."
"I'm assuming they mean ""Home Owners Association"". Referring to the formed groups of homeowners in a neighborhood, often notoriously ran by draconian and petty people who like to walk around the neighborhood and asses fines on their neighbors for petty things like the trash cans being visible from the street if you duck down and look from a certain angle or the doorway being painted the wrong shade of light blue."
Theres HoAs in Michigan that will not allow you to have an American Flag or Statue or Mary in your yard because theyre run by people not from this country.
Last season an admin's team had an unsafe rejoin that wasn't penalized. They don't see a problem with the conflict of interest it causes.
If you didn't know that they didn't have teams then I'd have to assume that there's tons of other stuff you don't know about...
VSCA admin confirmed.
This comment doesn't make any sense. How does that explain scheduling their events at the same as iracing?
"I told them they were fixing results because a guy from the admin's team had an obviously unsafe rejoin at Indy, and while they were initially penalized, they then overturned it with logic that violated their own rules. When I told them by violating their own rules to overturn penalties makes it look like they're fixing races, they banned my entire team, even a driver who said nothing. 

Not surprised to see a lot of other reasonable people have also had issues with these despotic admins."
"Haha. Response options:

1. Yes
2. No
3. I'm expecting to be banned soon for responding to this poll"
"""Raise your hand if you've been personally victimized by VCSA"""
"If true, big."
"I asked for the refund?

I mean if they were aware they were being cunts and *wanted* to be cunts then they’d keep it I suppose.
Lol wtf are you being downvoted for. The admins profile picture has nothing to do with any of this. We have everything in the OP to point and laugh at VSCA but people are concerned over AI avatar? Lmao what.
"nononononono they would have changed the rules to make sure that a big name like him wouldn’t be in violation (i wouldn’t know, i’ve never heard of that league)"
"&#x200B;

"You can, but it didn't seem like that was OP's intent.  It was a ""I'm taking my ball and going home"" public rage quit lol"
No I'm not an admin or one of their drivers. I'm just a competitor on a random team.
"Are you volunteering to crunch all the numbers post race for every entry? Sounds like a ton of extra labor.  Working a league is a ton of work, and they felt giving you your money back and cutting ties was easier than finding time to crunch those numbers every single race to see who's stall was where and how many laps they actually completed.  
  
Screw them for being assholes, but it's a league, run by humans.  It's not a machine doing this stuff."
"Go one more lap then and put the next lap, even if the pitlane is closed. Play with the rulebook that was given to you... Do not try to make it yours, It ain't..."
The thing is that this very issue screws over real teams too. Just saying
A different league that's similar to VSCA
"I don't have the replay saved anymore, but based on my messages at the time, the gap was actually only about a second at the S/F line.  By the time we made it to T4/5, it had grown because we were stuck behind your driver taking his cooldown lap.

That's not to say I necessarily agree with the decision, just providing some missing context.

Edit: Found the replay. Gap was 1-2 seconds with GTD traffic ahead. Unlikely, but not impossible."
Why would that matter? An apologist here? Sounds like it's a good thing people don't know more or they wouldn't race the league. What a pathetic attempt at a put down! Lol
Like the ghost-rules only enforced at their leisure? Yeah… that’s what this post is about.
"And I’m sure the shit you don’t know would fill several books, maybe even a full library."
"They said essentially ""so you can't join our race, wreck someone and then just join the special event"" or the other way around."
 like when one admin punted the lead gtd car and then proceeded to hand a suspension ( based on SR ) to that gtd driver taking him out of petit le man.
"Well, if they were half as entitled as reddit seems to paint them to be, that entitlement would even more so apply to the money you give them, no?
Who wants to see money go?
Or maybe, just maybe, there are many salty people around the iRacing community that will throw a tantrum if things do not go their way. I joined recently and the best description I have for it so far is ""The League of Legend of SimRacing""."
I think we have stumbled upon a salt mine
You either get with the lynch mob or beat it buddy.

"you mad, you big mad"
You're missing the point so hard you must be one of the admins of VSCA.
Do you calculate stuff by hand? Is there no member that has scripting knowledge to write maybe a simple Python script to crunch the numbers?
Exactly
Exactly the opposite. IMSA stops the timer once you hit pit lane and it only starts up again when you exit pit lane.  They literally have a system in place to prevent it being unfair.
IVRA\*\*
"I don’t agree with the depiction of time based off my 9 month old recollection but i know the leader faced zero traffic or issues along the way. Once again, the issue is not the situation itself with “impeding” a car on their final lap. The issue was race controls handling of something 24+ hours after that affected zero results. A situation where we have no ability to know we didn’t pass your lmp2 by inches"
"I've been a member for 3 years , fully understand the rule book and keep up to date with all changes and iterations, it's not hard."
"The SR suspensions don't even make sense. iRacing officials use SR as a determinant in eligibility because they can't possibly manually review every incident.  


In VSCA, they actually do review every incident and have an at-fault penalty system for every single car contact. If every contact has a fault determined, why would you use the faultless SR system to determine if somebody is eligible? That means somebody can be banned for low SR despite causing 0 crashes, if he is sufficiently unlucky. Before my permanent ban, I was suspended for low SR despite causing just 1 crash while other people with 3-4 crash faults were not suspended. It makes zero sense."
which admin did this
exactly
"I guess, they're downvoting us too now like lmao what. Redditors are barely even humans, man."
I accept your apology.
"No, I run an oval league though.  Shit is a lot of work.  
  
  
I tried to have an open discussion about how the rule would work differently if you put the person in a different spot.  I then offered that they may be too busy to compute every driver of every entry to your level of detail, I then suggested you could try to volunteer to help with that data computation.  
  
Your replies all over the place have been that they're trash, that may be true, but if that's how you replied there, I can see why they didn't feel the need to bother any more."
"Well simracerhub is pretty robust for this, but they're ""laps run * average lap time"" style is pretty efficient in 99% of scenarios.  OP is trying to find a tiny edge in the rules so their slowest driver can run 1 less lap than the previous rules allowed.  
  
Rather than qualify better so their stall is in front of SF, or run their slow guy second so he gets the free lap completed exiting the pits, he's decided to throw the onus of lap counting on their presumably unpaid admin team.  It's a bold strategy, and step two is apparently vent on reddit. Let's see how it shakes out."
"Yes and they have timing loops to check this automatically. You do not have that in iR, do you? (Genuine question, new to iR)"
I guess then it was good you left since you’re complaining about what happened and can’t come up with a possible solution to potentially fix the issue.
"Ok then what would you propose be a possible solution to this then? Not saying either party is correct, I am genuinely curious as to how you would prevent this in the future."
Yep! Thank you for the correction!
They could’ve just said that? It’s reasonable. What’s unreasonable is just outright banning someone who asks about it instead of explaining it. It makes them come off as petulant children.
"Man it's like you're trying to miss the point. 

The main issue is their poor response to people pointing out flaws in the rules. 

But as to the rule itself the entire point in bringing it up was to try to make the system fair across the board so if the pits open at 24:30 the teams with pit stalls before start-finish don't get screwed while teams with pit stalls after start-finish get to pit on the first lap. That's exactly the opposite of me trying to gain an advantage."
"So you use the same simhub laps * avg? 
I see simhub has functionality to adjust calculations, but I'm not sure to what degree. Do you know if that formula can be modified?"
"I think the Winter N24 league wrote a piece of software to monitor an accurate drive time of each driver within a team, it was very impressive (but also 3rd party, so not the easiest to do for your average league owner)"
"Sure, but we're also just getting OP's at face value.  No screenshots, perhaps the rules of the discord require them to use the search function and they don't feel like copy-pasting the same conversation every time someone asks. Idk, I prefaced the whole conversation by conceding I have no idea how shitty VSCA is and they could be literally awful."
"It was explained. Tone was maybe a little harsh, then answer was harsher and so on and so on and it just escalated from both parties."
"I mean, I don't.  I help run an oval league with no driver changes.  I'm just trying to put myself in the admin's shoes here and figure out if there's an easy way to accommodate OP that doesn't involve looking at every stint by every car to cross check against pit stall location etc."
"I do a bit of scripting so anything that involves a computer, I know can be automated with Python which is the simplest programing language. There may be tools that require less knowledge and effort so I usually try to exhaust those options no avoid ""re-inventing the wheel"".

What you describe sounds very possible to automated, but there may be a tool that already has it covered that's easier to use. I just don't have enough experience using sim racing addons, etc. So I wouldn't know."
"Yeah SRH, which many leagues use, now can pull the API race results which gives more data than the old html method.  But it sounds like this league is just using ""laps run"" from the iRacing file multiplied by avg lap time to get what they need.  If iRacing is outputting that number, than most leagues, even if it could be done by manpower, will try to default to that anyhow for 1) convenience and 2) not appear to have bias when certain rules are enforced or not.  A lot of leagues I've participated in will use admin cautions and Daytona and Talladega, but others will utilize iRacing cautions only to not appear to have any bias on certain wrecks causing a yellow or not.  
  
End of the day, when volunteers are working to put something nice out there, if you want it even nicer, you offer to do it yourself.  Sometimes they'll even say ""you don't have to, we can do that ourselves, thanks for the suggestion!"". But asking them to do more work is usually always gonna get some backlash.  
  
In the snapshot we got from OP, it certainly sounds pretty shitty the way they handled OP's request, but if this league is as popular as this thread has made it seem, then the drivers are easily replaceable and while I don't like the admin's attitude, I understand how it happened."
This is what racing is all about imo. I’d trade 5 laps of this for 14 hot laps any day.
"The one pass on your right around 8:30 Iliad me puckered up, such an aggressive overtake I love it."
"I wish I had been in that race - did a dozen of these last week and each one was a crash-fest, though I did learn to skip quali, start from the back, and avoid the first lap crashouts.  This clean racing in the vid is mind blowing - nice driving!"
I can't stop staring at the antennae in the dead center of the race car.
I hope you enjoyed every second of that. Races like that are rare.
"Oh yeah, was very fun and very intense. I just haven't experienced anything this sustained and this action packed in F3 so I'm just flabbergasted. Wanted to say the lap times to explain how fierce the fighting was."
"My mind completely blocks it out while driving, my partner said how can you see with that thing!"
"I did, I was just also hyper focused on not being a reason for it all ending 😂"
"Yeah 100%, didn’t mean to sound like I was implying you were complaining :) this is commendable racing from everyone involved. Races like that are pretty rare and always a lot of fun when it’s clean. I had a race at Indy in the F3 yesterday that was amazing and a few were in the chat afterwards talking about it. See you out there!"
Oh yeah if i was driving for sure wouldnt matter - I know there is a setting where you can make things like the f1 halo translucent. Maybe this is involved in that
"There is, but the F3 antenna isn't one of the items that can be removed or made translucent"
Street stock for rookie all the way. The legend cars are fun but they drive nothing like any other oval car. Street stock will give you the base for moving into ARCA which is still one of my favorite cars.
"I just bought ARCA to dabble in some D oval and that car is surprisingly fun, challenging, and sounds pretty decent."
"Rookies only have 2 options: Street Stocks, or Legends. Legends is a bit less chaotic, but Street Stocks is more popular.

After that, if you want to race NASCAR series, the recommended path is ARCA->Trucks->Xfinity->Cup."
I prefer legends for rookie class. And then late models when I got higher since that’s what I grew up around
Dont forget that ARCA=Gen4 so you can also run that series once you’re in C GEN 4 Cup
"NASCAR, ARCA and Street Stock type racing? Indy Car? Dirt?"
Arca is fun af
Legends and street stocks
You can technically complete your rookie license this week racing the Lotus 49 if you’d like! At motegi oval.
"Even at Class A, I love the Legends"
What car got you into racing oval. Answer that and buy that one 😊
"If you like nascar go as follows 

Rookie street stocks
D class arca Menards (draft masters is fun but will probably stunt your progress due to incident points)
C class truck series
B class xfinity
A class cup

Another fun d class is the late model fixed series. But the reason I suggest following what I said is because you’ll be buying tracks along the way that you will need for future nascar series. Late models run at short tracks. Arca will go to the  bigger tracks as well as short tracks."
Street stock. You're pretty much required to start in that car. Well there's Legends too I guess. But Street stock is a more direct path.
I guess I’m going to get into ARCA keep seeing these comments. Been loving the street stock series so I’m ready for the next challenge.
Are there FCY in arca?
"Yeah ARCA is a blast. I much prefer them over the next gen Nascar, those are like, too smooth? I want some shake and rattle in my racecar ya know?"
"Big time road racer here. So if I want to race cup cars at COTA/Watkins I need an a oval license? Correct? 

I thought I remember hearing about it taking your road license or irating or something like that? Thanks for clarification"
Thanks
Racing gt cars on forza motosport 6 on indy brickyard and daytona
Yeah. ARCA is fantastic and really teaches tire wear. The modifiers are fun too but they don’t get many official races outside of a couple a week it seems.
"No, fcy doesn’t come in until class C. So trucks and gen 4 and NIS. Means if you keep it clean you’ll likely have a decent finish."
"I love the nextgen too, but they don’t drive like any of the other stock cars. Much more on rails and tighter window between under and over driving the car. It was a blast at Auto Club once I got the setup dialed in and figured out it had a weird off throttle under steer thing going on."
"The other commenter is incorrect. You need an A Oval license to race the Cup cars. It will affect your Road license, but you need the Oval license to enter."
[deleted]
"Actually, you can skip Xfinity and Truck. Truck in C licence, Xfinity in B. If you want to race NASCAR cup car, in C licence soon will start NASCAR iRacing Series from Daytona 500 race and will follow real life Nascar schedule.

Yes, in A licence we have NASCAR A racing that will follow same schedule as NiS series but shorter races and nore often. Path to that place through a B licence can be with Nascar Legend series on 87 NASCAR cars. I prefer 87 cars and skip Xfinity and Truck."
Keep to the free cars for D. Save your money. When C rolls around you have better options
Appreciate it
"No, you need an Oval license to race an oval series. It will affect your Road License, but you need the right Oval Class to unlock the series."
Incorrect. You’ll need an Oval class C for NIS or Oval Class A for the A class series to register for the respective races. The actual race will only affect your road license though. I was racing official nascar class a and b road course races with a rookie road license
"Worth noting that NiS races are longer than A class as well, with 4 (including daytona 500) are full-length. Those full length races can easily be close to 4 hours long. Not something I'd readily recommend for someone relatively new to oval racing."
"Ohhh, I had this all wrong. Appreciate the clarification!"
Where is the sad part?
I can’t believe I opened a fresh pack of Kleenex for this
"Probably saw you incident, determined you were not at fault and decided you deserved the position. It happens sometimes"
You're overthinking it during the race
would the correct word maybe be something along the lines of “wholesome” rather than sad?
Could he of had a slow down penalty?
"What's sad about this, and why give a position for free for no reason?"
"If you caught up you were just faster, he probably thought that fighting you would make him lose time so let you through.
If someone is faster behind I rarely fight them tbh, will only cause me to make mistakes and lose time being defensive."
What were the qual times?
He might have had a good reason. One of them being that P2 is actually a better position to be in sometimes. For draft for example. Especially on the last lap.
"This story isn't racing. If the driver moves over to let you go, go and don't look back."
Maybe he was just feeling kind? I've given up wins before on the line if I've already had a few that day or had good races with the same person and they're consistently finishing P2. Random act of iRacing kindness
That folks don’t race for fear of getting punted.
Possibly.
"OMG I didn’t think of that. I’m pretty sure no, but if he did and I gave up my place lol….  Again I’m pretty sure not. I was close enough to see he didn’t bounce through the chicane."
That’s what I wondered and I find it sad that folks are so untrusting of other drivers they’d rather give away a position than race for it. I hadn’t even shown I was prepared to overtake. And given that my pace was only slightly faster in the laps leading up to it I didn’t expect to able to go for an overtake barring a mistake from the car ahead.
Maybe this is on the mark.
15.9 ish for P1 16.6 for me. Not the fastest I’ve come across.
Yeah I get that but not in this case. Charlotte doesn’t really have much drafting. He was fairly obviously just letting me by to avoid an incident. Perhaps he assumed I’d fly off the road.
Fair enough. I think if I had pulled out 2-3 secs I would have kept going. But I wasn’t really making any gap after another lap or two pushing for the leader and then having a shit lap before the white flag made me feel like it wasn’t a deserved p2
Could be it. Nice thing to do
"Tbh, fair. I also think there are way too many dive-bombers currently and I catch myself driving looking backwards a lot more than I should."
"Some people on iRacing are truly afraid of racing.
But why did you also let him pass in the end? A free position is a free position."
ok so my PB is 1:30 off top split. I should be good @1500ir
"I'm generally not fast enough to reliably overtake people. If I'm overtaking, something usually went wrong with the other guys lap.

If he broke the car, I get a spot. If he sorts his shit out and gets back, I'll happily let him by.

It's amazing how well you can do just by not exploding your car"
I agree. I’ve never raced so far feeling confident about anyone behind me. Definitely have had some that haven’t hit me when others might have but I don’t expect not to be hit.
Cos I felt I didn’t earn it and didn’t think I would have overtaken him. I would absolutely not pull a do or die move to gain one place.
17.5s were decent lap times for the majority of the top split in most of my races. I was in the low 17s at the end of races after having lunched my tires.
I notice minimal difference between 240 and 120. I’m sure it’s there if I looked but I can’t imagine 480+ is worth the premium for racing purposes.
"The importance of FPS decreases exponentially with a higher refresh rate. The transition from 50 to 100Hz is way more noticeable than transitioning from 100Hz to 200Hz. Moreover, the light perception is limited by our eye receptors and brain capabilities, so even that diminishes the impact of huge refresh rate at some point."
I think there is more of a difference between 1440/1080. I would take 144/1440 over 360/1080 any day.
I honestly don't see any difference between 144 and 240. I get 240 in practice and 120-140 in races.
I have a 240hz monitor and it’s great for competitive FPS games and gives you an advantage for sure. On a racing game I don’t really see the need
"I've got good hardware, I just ran a little test drive (so no other cars on track) with the slider one click off max frame rate settings (so it didn't completely turn off a bunch of elements) and unlocked frame rate.

Consistently in the low to mid 600s while driving, with occasional peaks above 700fps."
During draftmasters last week I was seeing constant 210fps. I’m only running a single screen tho but still pretty nice.
"On low settings on 1440p my FPS jumped between 440FPS and 480FPS with all cars rendered. Can be little bit more.

But I don't play on low, there is no reason for me, I have max settings and v-sync on 120FPS and this enough for me. I'm happy."
I can tell 144hz vs 120hz easy.
"Are we talking about monitor refresh rate or frames per second output? Refresh rate is given in Hz and I definitely noticed a difference between 60hz and 144hz at 60fps. You get that little bit more time to react even though the frame rate is the same. I’m not sure what exactly happens (at 144hz the monitor is starting to display a rendered frame sooner?) but everything feels a little smoother. 

In terms of fps, I have a 3060 and 10700f and with the settings I have get between 75-100fps on a 144hz 32” 1440p display which is good enough for me. Any lower and it starts to give me a headache. When I was still at 1080p on a 24” display I could get upwards of 200fps. I miss those days…"
"so many frame luddites here, I never would have guessed    

what did you think of the nice 48fps Hobbit ?   bit too fast for your smooth brains ?"
"I've seen 400+ fps on my rig, but I wasn't hunting for high fps, was just a simple dry benchmark. This was without fps limit, on the centripetal circuit, but still with all settings on max. I guess it could be a lot higher if all settings are low. But this 400 fps did not look any different to me than 165 fps g-sync which I normally do (iRacing limited to 170 fps). Of course this is probably also because my monitors can't display it. But you asked for the limit.

For ref: AMD 7700X, 32GB DDR5, RTX 4090."
"I’m racing triples with steady 75 fps and I don’t feel I’m missing something? I mean , It would be nice to have 144 fps , but beyond that for Simracing I think it’s pointless .
Other games might need more FPS but Simracing I doubt it"
"I prefer looks over super high refresh rates in racing games. iRacing in 4K looks stunning on newer scans/artworks. 100-120fps is plenty for me, I want more in shooters but car racing is not comparable to shooters at all."
"90hz ?      Is this the sweet spot, or will every single comment here be downvoted?"
"The difference between 240 and 144 is noticeable for me, but really only when you switch between the two. Once I’m getting solid 240, sure it feels smooth but I’m not actively paying attention to it. I can tell when I’m at 144 though. The slight delay is enough, but well past that you’re getting diminishing returns."
can yours push a solid 240?
the fact that thousands of engineers have continued to make faster screens after getting to 360hz says otherwise
Agreed. Can't feel it in racing. CS of Valorant on the other hand is a different story
"yeah - it is weird that everyone does not see the need for racing games.   When it helps for FPS games, and even competitive Tetris players using old NES and CRT combos for best possible latency.   Oh well."
"ooooooh, nice."
"Sounds good - but if you had a 360hz monitor and could run smoothly at that rate, I suspect the feeling of clarity would make up for being on 'low settings'."
"and I'm guessing my own 'max' is under 240hz,   
but for making a perfect rig (especially for kids), I'm glad that 540 is possible."
"60hz and 60fps are the same thing       
I would suggest with your setup, if you could lower the settings to get above the 144 that your monitor maxes out at, then the sublime smooth feeling of constant solid framerate will make up for the objects at the side of the track looking more square.     


But from all the other comments here it seems I am in the tiniest minority.      As a half measure, I suppose I could suggest that your system/settings might look better if you capped it at 75, so your brain is not getting little tastes of faster information."
"thankyou!    great to get a real answer instead of what I have been getting !     
nice machine"
"what makes you think other games might benefit from more, but for racing 75 is the optimum?"
"Just for data's sake, how old are you?  I seemingly can't tell the difference once I get above 120fps and I'm almost 40"
During practice yes. When there’s other cars on the track no. During race it’s usually 120 at race start and then maybe 150-180 depending on the track.
"Engineers doing this because CEO of companies where they work, ask them to do this. CEO ask them to do this, because they have high quality sellers, that convince people against math and logic, that they need to buy and play in 360hz+ screens."
"It also comes down to the game. I am running at 144hz and have tried 280hz and didn’t really notice the difference in sim racing. However for competitive fps games like counter strike and valorant, I definitely notice the difference. Small objects (players) are easier to discern at higher refresh rate compared to a car. 500+ hz will eventually be the norm for competitive fps. 

I’d focus more on getting a solid panel that minimizes ghosting and response time vs choosing the absolute highest refresh rate for sim racing. Just my two cents."
"After owning an 8k hz mouse for a year and a half, I can say that 8khz is nothing more than a gimmick. Just because the tech is there doesn’t mean it’s necessary"
"They have also engineered refrigerators with screens on the door that let you see what's inside the refrigerator without opening the refrigerator.

Just because someone built it doesn't mean it's truly useful.

Your eyes do around 60fps.

Sightly higher is helpful for FPS games to help avoid issues with target tracing.

Really can't imagine you need 100+ for iracing."
Why is this down voted? Simracers in general really are tech illiterate. I'm leaving before I get even more annoyed by the ignorance here.
The high refresh rate isn't that important (tho it makes for great marketing) it's the reduced pixel response time and lower latency that generally comes with those higher refresh rate displays that is more important.
"I don't need. I prefer high settings over speed. Everything 100+ for me enough smooth. In iRacing physics not hard connected to FPS like in most games and sims. Like in WRC23 for example. But anyway in WRC23 I can have my lovely 120 on ultra and this is enough.

I can't get it, why sacrifice image beauty for image speed? If you explain me you point of view, I will be happy. Maybe I will learn something new.

 I understand when beauty means playing on 30FPS but... If I have 100+ there is no place to lowering image quality.

You have your demands, I respect them, but I have my demands."
"It's the pixel response time that improves clarity, a 360Hz monitor is no good if the pixel response is too high to have it change to the color you need for the next frame, that just results in a smeared image."
"Not, you are wrong, this is not same thing. 60hz it's how amount times you screen change picture. If you have 30FPS and 60hz screen then in perfect condition you screen will show two times same picture. 

I'm now oversimplified, so if someone want correct me technically, I know, I oversimplified.

If your FPS monitor (Fraps, MSI Afterburner ect) show you 60FPS you image can be lagging, even if FPS monitor show you 360FPS, because if in 2/3 of second game shows you 20 frames and in other 1/3 of second games show you 340 frames this still be 360FPS on FPS monitor (like MSI Afterburner, Fraps ect) so for smoothest you need ""flat"", same frame time.

But reading your comments, I understood for who salesmans tell ""if you want to be ultra compatative, cyber superpower e-sports superpro athlete with highest win rate in entire galaxy, you need this new, ultrafast, shiny curved 4K 1000hz screen only for 99999.99usd""."
Reading OP's question is hard ;-)
"To add, if I do the same test again but with all settings on low, I get 999fps :-)"
"I’m 49 and can tell a difference between a 120 and a 240. It’s not huge, but until you’ve seen them side by side it’s hard to say whether you’d see a difference. It’s diminishing returns the higher you get, but there is a difference."
"Mid twenties, and I have good eyesight. I don’t wear glasses, never needed them."
nice to know it can get to 240 and there is no internal limit due to physics or timing - so with a good enough CPU / GPU we should be able to do 240hz solid
I suspect there is a demand from young e-sports players who appreciate the high FPS
"Fine to have your two cents, but I cant see the difference to 'competitive FPS games'.    Do you know how many centimeters we travel in a 144hz frame at 180mph?      
  56cm!  - that is quite a lot of change between frames"
jesuschrist you guys are killing me
"I do feel the framerates OP is talking about are way overkill but it’s entirely false that our eyes see at 60hz. Firstly, there is no real “framerate” of our eyes because the world doesn’t move in frames. Anything we can’t process visually is blurred, i.e. motion blur. As a heavy VR user, 60hertz is unusable. 90 hertz is the minimum needed to not see individual frames, but i can personally perceive a difference as high as 130. 

Even then, if you can’t perceive a quality difference above a certain frame rate, a higher framerate means the sim world gets visually presented to you sooner."
"just not true       
I can easily tell between 144hz and 120hz     
and I'm 44 years old"
"What do you mean by ""your eyes do around 60fps""?"
Ohh no…. You actually believe this?
I had no idea it was going to be this bad.
"Higher refresh rates actually benefit racing games more than FPS IMO. Rarely do you have things passing by the edge of your screen at 150+ mph. That extra FPS will make a massive difference for picking up visual cues, which are essential in racing

Edit: I agree FPS isn't the #1 priority, but it actually benefits racing games more than you think"
"are there some 360hz monitor that have this problem specifically, or do you just think all 360hz screens are worse than slower ones?"
"honestly, hertz is the same as frames per second       
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate)"
Theoretically and it will really depend on your settings and resolution. I play on an ultrawide G9. If I turned settings down it would probably be consistently 240.
"It's not denied math and logic. People can be wrong and feel like they right, and want to have something that they feel they need. Until thay pay for they wishes, nothing wrong with this demand. But in reality math right, people wrong. Difference between 60 and 120 huge, difference between 240 and 360 small and hard noticed.

Somwhere I have saved video from developer conference, where engineer talk about people behaviour. Any new pach people shit throwing in them, so engineers just artificial create less ping. You have 100 but game say you, you have 50 (but in reality you have 100), you have 80 but game say you, you have 30. And people noticed how really game much better response on they actions. But nothing changes. People feel and happy but in reality they wrong."
"It's because of the nature of a competitive fps.

You are tracking and aiming at small objects moving around. And then trying to hit them with small objects.

Racing, while yes you move faster, is also larger movements and larger targets. Your corner apex doesn't pop out and pop back rapidly from 500m. It's always there. It doesn't move."
"But it's not a lot of change of visual data, you still have a similar amount of gray track around, a similar amount of blue sky, etc and they are still in the same relative place as they were the frame before. Sim racing generally rewards smooth input, shooters rely on twitch movements and being able to pick up a change in the scene as quickly as possible (like spotting an enemy), two completely different use cases."
That’s more distance from your head to the windshield of any car 😂😂😂 that is nothing
"but they have voted me down out of existence     
great     
the 60hz boomers win again"
Let's see if you can tell the difference between 500Hz and 1000Hz.
"Haha! Yes, indeed, I was surprised as well. It's been shown over and over again, in different ways, that even a couple of milliseconds is easily noticed and can throw you off. The limit to where there's no use going further seems to be about 1000+ FPS/Hz, so neither 60, 120 or 540 Hz.

Also, people talk about smoothness. That's the least important factor. The input latency is the only really important. Then the motion blur is also noticeably reduced with higher FPS/Hz. With VRR and a jitter free time framing, even 60 Hz can look smooth - so that's not the problem."
"This seems so logical to me.    
I'm still shocked there is such a huge majority here that vehemently believe it couldn't possibly help to have more frames in a racing game."
"I'm saying that the big 360Hz sticker on the box is mostly for marketing (at least for sim racers), what really matters (at least regarding smoothness of motion which is what matters in sim racing) is pixel response time, something that is much less marketed. 

Take a 120Hz monitor and a 360Hz monitor that have identical pixel response times and your experience won't be much different between them. You need the faster pixel response times to back up the refresh rate to have a smoother experience.

Now for FPS shooters it's a little different, smoothness is less important and what is more important is reducing the amount of time it takes for new visual data to be made available to your eyes, this makes picking up enemies that suddenly emerge into view quicker, so a higher refresh rate can help, you may even trade motion handling and smoothness for that more rapid update of data.

But sim racing and FPS shooters are completely different animals so what is prioritized for one isn't for the other"
"yes, difference between 240 and 360 is small      
but it is still a difference      
and then even more of a difference up to 540hz      


and thank sweet baby jesus there are some humans that thought it was worth making a 540hz screen, because going by this thread, it was the most regarded thing anyone could possibly have ever done, and will result in the end of civilization itself."
"You honestly dont think a faster framerate would help a high level esports sim racer?     
Seems odd that so many people defend low rates saying we cannot even see them, but then there is your group who acknowledge FPS players can see and benefit from it, but think it would not help racers ??!?!"
"I suspect not.   But seeing as they are making 540hz screens now, we might see a 720hz before they realize that they have peaked.     
Either way I'm really glad they carried on above the 24 / 60 / 90 that some people seem to swear is all we would ever need."
Because they don't race and think racing is turning left.
"It would help, it’s so marginal though that you’re not really gaining anything from it, even if you are top .001%. In fps games however, a 144hz vs a 360hz can be the difference of getting a kill or being killed at a professional level. Even still M0nesy, one the top players in counter strike, made it pro with a 60hz monitor, goes to show that top guys are still the best with low end equipment. 
 
Your acting like your thought process is so much more superior to everyone when in reality the monitor you have doesn’t make that much of a difference once you are at 144hz in sim racing."
"People say a lot of dumb stuff, they dont have the vision of what the future could be. We had to go to the moon to find out (or make sure) that its really not that interesting being there. Taking science and tech to the extreme is how we find out"
"I have never heard anyone who would claim that we don't need anything above 90Hz, as the increase of refresh rate beyond that level still gives people tangible and discernible gains.

The other aspect high visual refresh rate are the limitations of the physics engines, which carry out the calculations at a constant rate and the granularity of these operations influence both visuals and ffb feeling. iRacing's physics engine caps at 360 Hz, which implies that a car running at 72m/s  (or 260 kph) will move 20cm in every simulation step. This implies that a higher refresh rate in monitors, even with subhuman visual percepion capacities, will not provide any gains drivingwise. The engineer who develop the simulators try their utmost to shave off another microseconds in the physics processing loop, which is not easy given the increasing complexity of the games year by year."
I'd take 360hz - that sounds sweet
Just start messaging people that ran the race with you.
"Thank, I didnt knew you could mp peoples"
Did you end up finding someone? I might be interested.

I used to run iracing with 3x4k monitors off a laptop. I just built a new desktop with a Ryzen 9 and 4070ti and i get comparable performance to the laptop.

No.
Triples are only better if you have space for a dedicated rig. If you are space constraint I would go down the VR route any day.
Oh sorry it’s got a 1660ti i7 9750h and 12 gbs of ram but it has only one hdmi port
I’m not trolling
"You answered your own question. One port means one other screen. 

You are going need a desktop with a dedicated GPU with 3 or more separate ports."
Then I’d consider this route very much :)
"0 times 10 is still zero, fatness here I come"
That's a great idea. Can't wait for Daytona now.
"So uh, yeah me and my endurance ass can't do 300 push ups"
40 push-ups to get dive bombed in D. Woof
"With Daytona so close and being on a low split, hard pass"
"I burn a fuck load of calories sim racing idk what you are even talking about. I have to eat in between races, or if I'm rallying, every hour or so. 

If I don't, I burn so many calories physically and mentally, that I get wobbly legs."
"I'll exchange that for something to strengthen my lower back. I'm leaning to the left badly, probably because of the braking. Any ideas?"
I used to do that with MW2 amount of deaths in a round = burpees in between rounds
Just get a DD and crank the feedback up. Get 2 birds stoned at once.
"I have a better idea, for each penalty you eat a donut."
You might want to see a dr about that. Could be something else going on.
"Core strength, particularly the deeper core muscles like your TVA. If the body is working correctly, sim racing is actually a great mild workout. If you have any issues with your kinetic chain however and you lack core strength, braking and steering will be a lot more dysfunctional and perhaps further worsen compensation that’s going on."
Right? It's not rocket appliances.

"My friend you’re on the right track for sure. Ergonomics should be MUCH more important in sim racing than office work, one could argue. Given the forces going through your back/spine while driving.  

Crappy photo sorry but these are mine and they’re spaced in a way that forces go through my feet, then my legs, and then my core.

[My Throttle and Brake](https://imgur.com/gallery/m8hM3gB)

A neutral pelvic and a nicely staked spine thanks to a good posture is super ideal. 

In a perfect world you want to feel as much of the forces of a strong direct drive wheel in your core mostly, and not in your shoulders, arm and especially your lower back! The similar can be said for pedals and high-load cell brakes."
I saw a guy practicing in the lmp3 yesterday at Bathurts with 38 irating. He actually did some decent lap times.
"I see guys who are really fast in the gutter of IR all the time.  Fast doesn't mean good.  This is my observation and I could be wrong.    


A low IR means the computer thinks you are not placing where you should be in race finishes.  It has nothing do with safety rating.   
I am of the opinion that there are different types of people with low IR.

&#x200B;

1. Ragers who throw their race away because they got bumped and then start going for revenge and forget to race.
2. People who simply can't drive and wreck a lot.
3. People who get wrecked, run into, slammed, rearended and just can't break their bad luck streak and end up with a low IR where it is even worse.

I see a lot of people causing accidents then raging at other drivers when the replay obviously shows it could have been avoided by one or both drivers. Maintaining your mental cool is part of racing.   If you rage all the time, your IR is going to take a hit."
Yep you need to take the joker. thought pretty sure that at phoenix the joker is faster. but also looking through the results the penalty seems to be a 10sec time penalty.
Jokes on you I guess.
"You’re crewchief should’ve said you have to take the joker this lap on the final lap, I normally take it lap 1 so I don’t forget, but it’s probably not the best strategy"
Yup. That's a paddlin'. 
What's a joker?
you always have to take the joke lap once in a race.
"When it says  *""the Joker is only available once during the race""*, it means you only need to drive through it once. The joker lap isn't optional so you MUST take it at some point in the race"
How do you serve the 10s penalty? Is it automatic?
"On some tracks, you can't take the joker first time by: you have to wait until you cross the start/finish line (Barcelona, Daytona, Knockhill, and Sonoma IIRC). So I usually wait until the 2nd lap just to be safe."
"Rallycross has what is known as a joker lap. Basically the track has a place were it splits up into 2 sections. A regular one and and a joker one, that's either longer or shorter. And you need to take that alternate layout once in a race"
Ahh. Thank you

"VR is love, VR is life!"
"I've only ever played iRacing in VR, tried flat screen a few times and immediately understood the dumb moves some people make when on track... You can barely see or keep track of battles on a single screen VR close battles are much easier to gauge."
"I can't disagree.  It's incredible and I can't see racing on anything else besides better, lighter, cooler VR.  I'll have to check out that Pico, I had no idea they had a model that cheap."
i also love driving iracing in VR...a question: do you using overlays in VR? I didn't make it work and if you have tipps I would be really happy about it :)
Been racing in VR since 2014 with an Oculus DK2 and Live For Speed. I’ll never go back to driving a monitor.  
"even with lower fidelity I generally pick VR over 3 screens. there's just a difference when you're able to turn and look through the corner etc.  The depth is also great for oval tracks (Especially like Daytona and 'dega) so you can push without ramming.  

During longer races it can get hot and a little less ease of use for just firing it up but overall, VR rules."
"Me using VR after not using it for a period of time: THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER. So immersive, so cool!

Me using a screen after using VR for a period of time: THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER. So much more convenient and less strain on the eyes and neck!"
"I have a Quest 3 and have used various headsets (Vive, Quest 2, HP Reverb G2) Quest 3 is by far most comfortable for me, can wear it for a long race and forget it's on my face due to it having a good balance as it's so small also the lenses are a game changer, no more sweet spot means you never have to do those micro adjustments all race when it shifts on your face during a race.

&#x200B;

The most comfortable I can see is the Bigscreen Beyond headset, but it has baystation tracking and I prefer the inside out tracking for ease of use."
"I don't but I know in order to use them you have to race using open VR rather then XR or Oculus from what I remember.

&#x200B;

Also quite intensive for resources alongside running VR, I have got used to not having anything other than iracings in game relative timing."
"I've still a valid racelab subscription but I figured out it takes a bit of time to setup, as I couldn't directly load my layout. And some overlays are with a pink background or border, which looks really bad. Sooo I guess I also need to find one haha

"So true. I play in VR 99% of the time and used my monitor yesterday.

Kept getting blown away by how sharp and detailed everything looked."
"Yeah I've heard it's good, I'd love to use one to see the lenses, it's so hard to quantify how much better having no sweet spot would be."
"I am thinking about getting an ultrawide and stand for my race rig as currently only use VR but sometimes would just play on screen, is it worth me doing it? reckon I would use it?"
"Its like going from SD to 4K, being able to glance anywhere on ""Screen"" with same clarity, just being able to quickly glance at mirrors etc is much more natural than moving your whole head."
"For the past 6 months my answer would have been no, I never use it. But I have used my ultra wide monitor only the last two days and have really enjoyed it. I threw so many nordschleife mods together in AC that VR was never going to run it very well, on screen it's gorgeous."
"My experience as a new driver and recently dropping to 800 IR and then bouncing back to 1300.

The people qualifying in the top positions are usually all capable of driving a good race; even at 800 IR. **Usually** there are people qualifying in P1/P2 who have lap times substantially better than the rest of the field when you are in low IR splits. They tend to run a clean race and end up racing well ahead of everyone else.

The flip side is the back half of the field is a mess and usually filled with people who can't keep their car on the track plus a few people who **can** keep their car on the track but opted to not qualify for the race.

Even at low IR I've had great races competing against the people in P1-P4 ish.

Usually around there,  you see a huge gap and/or a bunch of crashed/lapped cars."
"IRating is a matchmaking tool. It reflects in which position you tend to finish races compared to others. It is then used to put you in the same split as others who tend to finish in similar positions as you. That’s all it is.

The theory of “using” it is simple: just race hard and respectfully and have fun, and the number will sort itself out. You don’t need to care about it. Only do that if you want to put a somewhat tangible number on progressing towards becoming a more competitive driver if that is important for you - and even then, maybe championship points are a more useful metric. Up to you!

In practice… maybe avoid dipping so low that you end up in splits where it’s hard to actually race - then you will have to prioritise survival above everything else in order to get up to splits with more competent drivers. And maybe avoid getting so far up in rating that you race only aliens and need to practice for many many hours every week just to feel that you belong in the split you’re starting in. Unless that’s your thing. If so, then by all means, shoot for 8k ;)"
"Safety rating gets you in the car/series you want, iRating puts you against racers of a similar skill level. Getting a higher iRating is a continually more difficult endeavor that only rewards you with more difficult opponents.

So.. it matters very little in terms of getting more enjoyment out of the sim"
Irating is the real safety rating. Just saying. Higher irating typically indicates closer and more competitive rating with more predictable drivers. Lower irating usually equals a bloodbath 
"There's nothing wrong with being satisfied with your rating but if you're looking to improve iRating is how that's measured. If you're forever stuck at a certain rating that means you're not really improving. In my case I've been stuck in the same several hundred point swings because as soon as I make progress I get taken out or ruin my own race which in a few instances has set me back ~80 IR a couple times because it's races I should've had an easy podium if not a win.


I'm sure it depends on the series but I noticed in IMSA once I dropped into the splits below 1.8k-2.2k it's been a freaking shit show. I'm a GT driver and I fear for my life around the prototype drivers in the 1.3k range."
"A drop-off, i.e.bottom split is always series, week and time of day dependent - more or less depends on the general participation. Your mentioned 1.4 may be bottom split, topslit or midsplit all due to participation, so aiming for a certai iRating doesnt make much sense if you want to do multiple cars and series.

Just race, iRating will sort itself out"
"Irating is the single most important thing in existence.

Even more important than oxygen itself or even atoms. 

I got below 8k and it almost ruined my life. Ferrari wanted their car back, my supermodel wife wanted a divorce and I stopped getting put on the  ‘on the door’ for A list events and night clubs as well as I could not get anyone (of importance) to come on my yacht. 

Do whatever you need to do to keep it. Be sure to waste money on Smurf accounts, don’t enjoy yourself by learning and racing other classes in case you tank IR and make sure you do six full days of prep work on the one class you do participate in so you can race just once a week. 

You definitely don’t want kids or other hobbies or interests. We (the super high IR guys) call them IVs (Irating Vampires) cause they suck the life out of your rating. 

Me: “My kids want me to take them to the movies. I still got half a tenth to find in one corner of next weeks IMSA track”. 

My super high IR team mate:  “selfish little IVs” 

The thought of having anything less that 10K IR engraved in my tombstone depresses me."
"Don't pay too much attention to your iRating. Its going to fluctuate naturally based on the series you're in, type of track and car combo. My iR always goes to the moon when I'm at road america, or interlagos or Road atlanta, and it drops hilariously at some of the other tracks, but it always finds it's way back to a happy medium. Your iRating fluctuates because its trying to get you to a level where you're gaining and losing very little to keep you around drivers of the same caliber as you.

  
The system has its flaws but it works pretty well, as far as stressing out about it? I wouldn't, I also wouldn't race *just because of SR* either. Actually race, and if your SR is constantly going down, then you need to look inwards at your racecraft. You should be at a comfortable enough skill level to where you shouldn't have to focus on specifically driving cleanly, that should be natural."
I personally believe iRating is only relevant for making top split for special events or high splits for qualifying events for wcs
">I was just wondering if there is a lower limit to Irating   Where you  see a noticeable drop off in driver skill. (Leading to more incidents I  imagine) 

Everyone will have a different answer to this because we all have different iRating and thus a different perspective."
"Ignore your irating and just focus on becoming better at racing. Focus on your technical skills, control of car, and avoiding wrecks. This is more important than any rating for 95% of the iracing polulation."
"There are fun races to be had in all splits, and there are chaos merchants in all splits. Qualify in front if you can, the middle of the pack is where the carnage usually kicks off."
"Sub-1k you'll find much more variance in speeds. You especially find guys capable of very fast times, but lack racecraft and consistency. They're fast enough to hot lap and easily take pole, but struggle to put together more than one or two fast laps, leading to poor race finishes."
"I had the best races in the 2-3K range, people below often make more mistakes, be overcautios or have unpredictable lines at times, in 4K or above drivers tend to sweat a lot a use everything they can to gain some iRating, at that range the drivers ego begins to get out of control at times too"
"It's your skill rating. It is important that you don't lower it on purpose, but any gains/losses made from racing is all normal. 

Yes the lower the number statistically the worse the driver, but also the bigger the spread of the fields laptimes so you wont be collected in more incidents. 

Build up your safety until you reach A 3.0, then focus on iRating, as SR becomes more of a ""crash budget"" once you get decently into A. It is still best to finish the race than to crash out of it of course. 

Keeping yourself in the 1,400s is fine, thats around where new drivers end up after rookies"
"Once i joined a league, I literally no longer care about iRating. I do a couple of official big events occasionally. Otherwise, over the last 6 months, my iRating has stayed the same."
"I’ve been playing iRacing for a year and a half. I don’t even know what my iRating is. I could care less.  I play iRacing to have fun racing cars virtually. It’s a fun little escape from reality in the evenings when I’m done with work and family stuff.  A number system means nothing to me. 

But hey. That’s just my opinion.

Edit. I looked because now I was curious. It’s 1690.  I don’t know if thats good or bad, but again, Either way it doesn’t matter to me. I’m just here to have fun! :).   See ya on the track!"
"The only useful reward from a higher iRating is racing the fastest drivers currently signed up to your particular time slot.

For most series a top split is around 2.5k+ SOF

So if you have say 2000 iR you'll probably be in the top split every time. Which means there's little reason to aim higher than this except for maybe creating a cushion so you can keep your spot in top splits even if you have a terrible race and drop -100 iR.

This is just an off-hand example but a really popular and high class series like IMSA (A class) can have 5k+ SOF top splits.  And major endurance events like Daytona 24hr can see an astronomical 8k+ SOF when all the eSports teams show up.

I recommend to just ignore your iRating and race for fun.  Most people that get burnt out with this game typically see iRating as the end goal, and rather not race at all than risk losing points.  It's a downward spiral."
"iRating matters quite a bit depending on the kind of competition you want to go up against. In popular series like IMSA, anything above 4k and you'll be in top split 90% of the time. Top split racing is a completely different beast depending on how high the SoF is. It tends to be much cleaner. Personally, I prefer that type of race however it can get overwhelming in some of the super intense SoF races when I have 0 chance of placing better than last.

&#x200B;

I've gotten to 5k and my strat the whole time has just been to drive slow and survive races with 0x incidents. Through doing that I've also gotten considerably faster but nowhere near the other people that I usually race against.

&#x200B;

I'd say the drop off is around the 2500 mark. If I find myself in one of those lobbies I know that people won't be racing clean and if I don't qualify on pole then I'll most certainly be killed.

&#x200B;

All that said, it all depends on what you want out of iRacing. If you want to have fun then just drive whatever you enjoy and don't stress to much. If you are hyper-competitive, then just finish every single race without incident and in short time you should be getting into 2nd or top split where things pick up a bit. If you choose the second route, then just know that you'll likely end up forcing yourself to only drive a single series and a single car otherwise you'll spread yourself thin and end up losing iRating because of it. Another tip: If you get good at spotting when crashes will happen and you master avoiding those types of situations, that's enough to get you to 4k alone. Pace will just come naturally as a byproduct of putting in clean laps. Also always finish every race, even if you wreck out. Most of the time other people wreck out and quit so those are just free positions to negate your losses."
"They’ll only engrave it on your tombstone so yeah, I’d say it’s pretty important."
"I think it ends up being over inflated in the lower licence classes anyway so don't worry too much about it. I think it's because they are quite generous with the starting irating. 

It's just my experience but 1k drivers in B/C class series seem more competent and competitive than 1.3k drivers in rookies."
"I don’t look At the number it’s self, but I look at the trend over time. One race at a time is too short to worry about. I enjoy looking back over a season perhaps it’s in a new car, where I’ll see it drop as I learn the car, then come back as my skill in that car evolves."
"It’s skill rating basically, used to match you against opponents of the same level during match making. It defines how good you are, relatively to your race finish positions."
Bad driving is universal. I have seen inexplicable stuff from drivers above 3k as well.
Depending on the series the cutoff its around 1200-1800k. Mostly 13-1400 I’d say
"It's quite important. If I get placed at a race with average rating of a 1000, I usually can quality one of the first ones and as long as I survive first lap - I usually have no issues finishing first with a comfortable margin. If I get average rating of 2000, I struggle to break into top 10, but may have an epic battle for 15th place."
"Your first 6 months to 1 year is all about learning different disciplines and tracks. IR is less important during this time, in my opinion. As you gain experience and find disciplines you excel at , you’ll find your IR improving.

The most important thing I, or anyone else, can ever share with a new racer….is to have fun above all else, if you aren’t having fun, you aren’t racing right."
Not important at all. Too many people focus and stress over a number and forget to enjoy themselves!
"lol yeah that last paragraph pretty much nailed it. I’m not obsessing over it or anything but I had a few races recently where I was about 5th and was gaining about 10 IR. I believe I could have pushed and gotten 3rd but I valued the .16 SR over the extra 40-50 IR. Wasnt sure if that’s worth it or not. 

I want clean respectful racing so I was worried about getting wrecked and dropping into an IR where everyone just kills each other."
"man I spent easily over 20hrs last week practicing in the acura for daytona just for them to BoP it to death. Back to the caddy I guess.

Those top 3 drivers in the high SoF races are untouchable though. I'm all for shooting for the moon but man those aliens are actually out of reach for us commoners.

By no means is 8k unreasonable but it will definitely take a huge amount of effort unless you have some sort of innate talent for racing."
That depends on what gives you enjoyment. I enjoy improving and facing stiffer competition as I progress.
Some people don't want to race at a low level just because everyone else is also low level. Progression and getting better is a huge part of competition based games. I don't understand why people don't get this.
"prototype drivers wouldn't be a problem if you just drive as fast as them. seems like a skill issue to me.

if you wanna increase you're ir, just quit racing the other people in your class and try to finish every race with 0x. if you do that, you'll get more ir in the long run and escape middle splits."
"I’m not aiming for a certain IR per se, more so thinking about a few races I ended up in 5th with no incidents. I think I could have gotten third but was a bit scared to pass because the people were a bit wobbly and I valued the .16 SR over the 50 or so IR I would have gained fighting hard for 3rd. Just wondering if that was reasonable or a mistake. I just want clean races."
This guy gets it!  Seriously if your irating isn't what you get out of bed for every day there you aren't even living.
"Agree, when I end up in a race and notice the SOF is larger than what I’m normally used to, I take the compliment and race hard and clean. Results vary in terms of finishing position but doesn’t matter. Sometimes a battle for 7th is just as exciting as anything else. The battles always with the car around you"
Agreed but I don’t have a ton of fun when people destroy me off the track .
Good to know. I’m not too worried about it but wanted to make sure that if I dipped to 1000 or so while trying to protect my SR that I wouldn’t be in splits that end with me in the shadow realm every race.
Another way to look at it is to be clear about what you value most on iRacing. Is it good fights or is it finishing position? It’s solidly the former for me - and I get to have most fun and even fights when I just race respectfully and safely and let the number sort itself out.
"This is me currently except I'm getting 5th while giving it my all.  If you only gain single digit iR after doing your best then you are where you belong.  If you start to lose iR then you've gained more than you probably deserved at your skill level.  Like others have said, it sorts itself out.  If you DNF and lose a lot of points, then next time you finish 5th you'll gain more than usual and be back to where you where eventually."
A lot of people don't understand this mentality.
"I respect your point of view. For me, I simply don't have enough hours to practice (and I'm not very good in the first place). If I'm on a level where I can more or less match the pace and the servers aren't full of psychopaths, I'm happy."
"As long as you’re challenged and improving, you can enjoy it at your own skill level, regardless of what the number reads - that’s all I mean in saying it matters little; the *value* of your iRating matters very little, so long as you are being challenged!"
"Part of the learning curve is actually choosing your battles, so imo you acted correctly if you saw a risk, but were happy where you are. Heck, sometimes I even wont battle for P1 and just settle for P2, if I know things might get feisty. Better safe than sorry. 

Regular wins dont matter that much anymore to be honest, fair racing brings more joy. I sometimes even give the position back, if I think my divebomb was too dirty and risky, which wouldnt happen in real life."
"It happens at all levels, including pros. It seems to depend more on series than level but everyone says 1.7-2k is the sweet spot. If you get good you can avoid most accidents in rookie 1k splits. Worrying about SR or iR can easily take the fun out of it."
"People talk like slow and bad drivers are the same thing but they arent. You can also get high IR drivers who are competent but overly aggressive. You might not get punted from behind but they can still run you off track.

Problem with Rookies and D is you have a lot of new drivers still getting to grips with iRacing. At least in low IR but higher licence events you are with people who have had more practice and can maintain their SR."
"Same for me honestly. Happy to finish 11th, having a blast fighting 8-12th for the spot."
I think it’s the fact that after a certain point it becomes hard work. I totally understand why they don’t get it but that’s just not how my head works. I always want to improve. I get a lot of satisfaction when I make steps and see clear improvement. Stiff competition only makes me want it more. It’s a huge motivator for me.
"Yeah, Irating is great for keeping track of your improvement and how you measure up against the competition. I find this whole sim racing business a whole lot more fun when I strive to constantly improve."
I also love competition. It kinda sucks though when you like hard competition but you also suck so you just get shredded every race. it's kinda demoralizing. Yet I keep goin back for more. :)
Expect it in either in March or June.
or today 😅
This car is so much fun. We used to run a fixed league with it. I'd join but I'm just not competitive in this car as much as I love it.
"It must be a Drive Through penalty, not a Stop and Go. Don’t stop in the box.

If it was a Stop and Go, it would’ve started a penalty timer regardless of if you took any service. But the penalty is longer (adds 25 seconds) if you take any service."
"When you serve a black flag penalty you cannot take a pit stop at the same time. 
So you would have needed to untick all pit options prior to entering the pitlane to serve your stop and go"
Is there a way of knowing what the penalty is in game? Seams like a oversight if not...
"Happened to me the other day, you don't brake in the pit just drive all the way through"
I would take a look if it was actually a stop and go. If you go to the results and then to show the result on the legacy membersite. There's a button fir session events that shows you all things that happened at will tell you what the penalty was
"If you are using crewchief, it can tell you about stop n go penalty, but in reality it is dt"
Jumping the start is a drive through penalty. Just…drive through in the pit lane. Done.
Was this in the LMP3 race last night by any chance?
"Really? Because when I serve Stop and Go last time, first I serve 40s of penalty and then pitcrew started they job.

Maybe he has not SnG, maybe he has DT?"
"Shit, I didn't realize that. I'm guessing I cycle through the arrows on the info box and until those. I'll take a look next time Ive got it up and running. Appreciate it!

Are there any faster ways to undo the boxes like hot keys?"
"It tells you, you just have to pay attention"
"That’s only if it’s a Drive through penalty, a stop and go you must stop in your pitbox"
Ok cool I'll check it out. Appreciate it!
No it was for F4 at Spa
"This is correct - any stop and hold penalties can be taken at the same time as a pit service. Drive through penalties you cannot stop, otherwise it’s not a drive through but a pit stop.

Jumping the start unless massive was almost certainly a drive through - they changed this last season or the season before to lessen the penalty"
"Yeah potentially, I think the jumpstart penalties depend on how much you jump right?

As for serving pit stop and S&G - I’ve never tried running both, so there is every chance it tacks the penalty time to the end of the stop. Good to know if that’s the case"
Yep! I think the defaults are F5 and F6? You can rebind these to something more accessible if you need to
"never had one, thats why i was asking. I can see from looking at youtube that it does tell you under  the flag."
You would have thought since a stop and go is the harsher of the penalty that it would count that for the drive through. It takes longer than the drive through.
"Exactly. I had a row set up with different pit settings. #clear will clear all pit changes. I had that, then right side only, 4 tires, add 5 gal, add 10 gal, and tear off for all. You can combo those up or push whatever sequence you want. This page will tell you all the hotkeys.

https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000170165-pit-macros-chat-commands"
"Because if you receive a drive through in a series that requires pitstops, then if the penalty is received at the time of needing to do a pitstop, there is no real penalty"
"I don't have the time to learn more than one track a week. If I realise that I don't like a track at all, I will not anticipate in races but i practice the track.


Off topic I'm driving the Falken Tyre Sports Car Challenge in the GT4 class. Daytona broke my spirit and i decided it's better to take a brake from iRacing."
"I'm a whack job. Also race ovals. 

https://preview.redd.it/suf8oyckhrcc1.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d93f30a97a7ca0b3682dc69c76a5138f57835a"
"I'm time constrained so I just race whatever I feel more like playing when I got the chance.

I usually do the full 30 min practice and then race"
"This is my first full season on iRacing, so I’m sticking with porsche cup until the end of the season, then hopefully some of the tracks in the schedule will then apply to other series’ next season. If I get my B license and am happy with the end of my pcup season, I think I’ll move to LMP2 or GTE for the next season.

It’s just more exciting to focus on a single series imo because it feels a bit more official and real to some extent"
"Weekly, I do:

Production Car Challenge

Skippy

F4 Regional Series

Mission R Challenge (the 1 SOF race, lol)

ProtoGT Challenge

I try to do every week in the series' I run. Even if I hate the track."
I just race whatever I think will be fun/fast
I spot a serious lack of PROTO/GT in those screenshots! 😄
I race like 5 series in the regular simultaneously 😂
I race mostly imsa and gt3 series when its the tracks i prefer. Occasionally Ferrari challenge
I drive IMSA in GTP this season but i have the Sportscar Challenge with the LMP3 as a Backup
"I definitely avoid tracks I don’t like. I’m not in any danger of competing well in the series standings so skipping a week doesn’t really matter. 

There’s usually a couple of series I participate in at the same time. Really depends on what I feel like tbh."
"I'm new so focusing on one car (FF 1600)

Usually only have time for one race a night which is enough to see myself get comfortable with the track; then I'll usually jump into the next track to start learning it before the races flip over.

Considering picking up the Vee also since they run the same tracks. Would let me get two races in per night which would be nice since I need the practice driving in traffic.

Had my first race last night where I was bumper to bumper with another two cars nearly the entire race and it was a blast. Of course I was the one that originally gave up position and couldn't figure out how to get it back the entire race!"
"At the moment I’m just doing the two GT4 series (same track and cars) because I’m only on my second season of iRacing and it takes me a while to learn the tracks. Like a solid half week of an hour or two a night before I can race, otherwise I’ll just crash out and lose safety rating. I’m still getting the hang of trail braking and general car control, so takes longer to learn tracks than most people I guess.

Once I’m familiar with most of the popular tracks I’ll probably start running more series at once."
"I stick to one car in one series, but I might do a random race with something different from time to time if I get frustrated.


That means that I spent most of my time on open wheel, but I might jump into an oval race from time to time. Not having to learn braking points and just race door to door is a lot of fun, but I don't see myself turning left all the time."
"do you really like charlotte on GT3‘s? xD    
I try to stay with one series and only skip the week of I really don’t like the car/track combo - like charlotte this week."
At the moment I just drive what content is available of open wheel except for vee
"Usually just do whatever feels familiar on the weekly races- often gt3 or advanced mx5.

At the moment I'm much of my week practising for league races which rarely are at familiar tracks/layouts - finding those extra tenths to make the difference."
"I race whatever is up next that looks fun when I sit down to race. Qualifying is my practice :D

Road, oval, dirt oval, rx - it's all fair game, the more the car moves around the better."
"https://preview.redd.it/jiy2sbj7rrcc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca3667e2da6d9969bff9f9c5c203ee680e038b83

Mix it up throughout the season. You can probably add in IMSA this week as I'll be prepping for the 24 in LMP2. I only really do one or 2 series per week as I don't have a great deal of time to race and don't really like repeating the same race over and over tbh. I was trying to get participation credit for GTE and Proto-GT but I've just not got around to doing GTE most weeks."
"I'm fairly new, so I am just sticking to the fixed Pcup and buying a track each week. I'm going to do the full season like this, then mix it up. Im halfway through and my love/ hate relationship to this car is growing stronger."
"I enjoy driving the two cars I drive regularly and I enjoy being part of a regular community,  chatting with the same people in the many of the races.  So I stick to just the two series, which pretty much always gives me at least 1 decent track each week"
"I choose a car and stick with it for a season, this season im running the audi gt3 and having a blast bonus is i get to choose between a couple of tracks a week"
Do people like the Charlotte Roval? First time there last week and I hated it.
"I have my primary series, that being the Mustang in PCC. I’ll race that every week on any track, mostly because I can drive that car in my sleep by now.

Then I’ll have my pool of secondary series that I’m reasonably competent at, like TCRs, GT1/2, and the odd oval or dirt road series. I’ll try and jump into these as often as I can, but I won’t go out of my way to buy any tracks I don’t already have, or bother on tracks I don’t like."
"I race seriously with good preparation in two series every week and additional I keep in track 2-3 series where I can take a part if track is interesting. But I don't really prepare to additional series. I'm go race if I can keep car in the track and can be between p10 and P20. I'm fine with it, I'm happy."
"I have a good amount of freetime and I'm not sure how anyone can race more than one or two cars/series at a time. I have to practice to make sure I'm on pace and not just going to kill my SR on a track I don't know that well.

I really don't know how anyone can play this game and hop around casually lol."
"I bounce around now, I used to stick to one or two series throughout a season but now I can't be bothered. I race what I want to race, sometimes thats prototypes, sometimes its dirt late models, sometimes its the next gens sometimes its super formula or miatas. There's no telling what I will drive until im on."
"I race whatever track/car combo I own lol. I only have one car and two tracks that are bought, so it ends up being 1/2 series a week for me anyway"
"I'm new so focusing on one car (FF 1600)

Usually only have time for one race a night which is enough to see myself get comfortable with the track; then I'll usually jump into the next track to start learning it before the races flip over.

"I always just pick a series for the season.  Makes it easier for practicing and planning.   And I set out to get participation credits just to motivate me to show up at least 8 weeks.

Last few seasons I've gotten great value out of picking some of the series that run fixed/open back to back.  Practice once, run 2 races all in a nice 2~ hour package.   
S12023 was IMSA LMP2, S2 was a ""off"" season where I only ran a LMP3 was a good season in S3 and SuperFormula was great for Season 4.  

This season I planned to run ovals for a change of pace but then the DIN connector in my round wheel broke and Christmas caused some delays with only now Thrustmaster dispatching me a replacement. 

Then I was gonna run GTP instead to practice for D24 but haven't found the time to run regularly so I've decided this season is an off season."
"I think you learn more imo if you stick with a series I think learning the track is the easy part which takes few laps to get on pace but learning the car is the valuable lesson 

Just doing the same track same car is fun but it would limit your growth a bit  I would think also boring 

So I do the whole season"
"I like to stick to one series and track (GT4 right now, did Mazda rookies last season) and run whatever oval I can when I want more casual racing."
[I am all over the place](https://imgur.com/a/GJShtpr)
"I am the same. It is not enjoyable to race at the track I am not familiar with very well.  So I don’t race but try to put down as many laps as I can in free practice. Usually next time this track is around   I am racing on it successfully.

“Usually” because there is Aragon where I just can’t find the pace lol"
"I feel you bro, Ive been there, but can’t miss this week mount Panorama, it’s been awesome. Hopefully you feel like getting back to it soon."
"I’m exactly the same. Except I only did one race last week in the GT4 because I hate racing at Rudskogen (fun hotlap track tho) but spent 10+ hours in practice sessions and getting my lines down, and now the GT3’s are at Daytona which I love, so I’ll be racing a lot there."
Also this but you get given 8 minutes to practice during something called 'qualifying' 🙃
"GTE is pretty dead, and LMP2 sometimes is pretty dead as well, it depends on the time, but for the most part you can at least have a somewhat full grid at the LMP2 fixed race, problem is you’ll have some guys 3k+ and some people not even 1k, makes for a very miss matched race, and sometimes in the IMSA I only see like 3 LMP2 in the race, seems like most people that were playing the LMP2 moved to the GTPs or the LMP3, the LMP3 is super fun, I would say way more fun than the LMP2, but I would say it’s also the most difficult to drive out of all the LMPs."
I'm doing exactly this. How you finding your first season in the Pcup?
 And can you be competitive on all? Or you just chill in the back?
"You are in for a treat this week, Mount Panorama is a rollercoaster, and one of my favourite tracks. Take your time learning it, it is tricky, but extremely satisfying when you are doing it at speed constantly. And if you aren't familiar, look into iracings active reset feature, really helps with learning tricky sections quickly"
"Just watched a hotlap of Charlotte, oh my god how can such a track exists, it seems horrible with no flow or anything, feels like Monaco without the fame"
Not cool bruv
"I jump around. I'm new, I hit C-license last night and my IR sucks.  I'm still trying to find something that clicks and is enjoyable. I practice with something that seems interesting, practice for 30-60 min until I can get around the track and then go for it. Its not like I could tank my IR anymore anyway, I'm always in bottom or next to bottom split, and often finish in the top half just from driving cleaner than than everyone else. I'm not trying to farm SR either, I'm pushing as hard as I can while still driving clean. I enjoy the exploration."
"That is amazing bro, and you pretty much gain iR in every race except for one👏🏼👏🏼"
"Mount Panorama is a cool track but it will be hell for SR, too IMPC is on this track too"
"well i’ll get the lmp2 anyways and see what luck i get! I saw lmp2’s racing IRL, and ever since I have had the need to drive them in the sim!"
"its going ok! I missed the first two weeks, and struggled to find pace at Aragon while also learning the car still. Since then, though, its been awesome! I got 2 wins at Spa and was consistently within the top 5, also gained a lot of iR! My pole lap at spa was a 2:20.913, which I was fairly proud of. Sebring was interesting as I’ve never driven it, but once I learned it I had a great time! I did 2 races a night for the whole week and upped my pace from getting 2:07s consistently to low 2:05s and even some mid 2:04s! I gained a lot of iR at sebring too and finally broke 2k which was exciting! My last race at Sebring was top split and I was put against a bunch of 8k drivers, so you can guess how that went for me.. lol

Overall Pcup has been so much fun and I’m excited to keep racing it! Its such a tricky car and takes real refined driving, but when you get it right it feels incredible.

How has your season been?"
"I’m holding my own pretty well against people with similar iRating, I’ve actually gained ~500 too since the start of the season (currently at almost 3.3k). Luckily, I don’t need a long time to be at a decent pace usually, so I only have to practice around 5-10 laps most of the time"
😅
"It’s a fun car, you’ll love it, it just sucks that the participation is not what it was."
"Wow man, that's amazing stuff. Two wins at spa and a 2:20 is so good - I'm guessing you've done a bit of sim racing before this 😀.  

Loving it so far. The car felt impossible to drive on the first week and now it all makes sense. It's still wild at times, but I know what to expect with it. Got a win at zandvort, which was the most adrenaline I've ever experienced whilst in my own house haha. I've found sebring a nightmare, T1 keeps catching me out. Been practicing on road american for this week and super keen to race on it. 

Only at 1.8k but I think that is my limit for now. Everytime I go into 2k sof splits I am struggling. In the less populated tracks I was being forced into top splits with 5k guys, my one goal was to not come last haha"
"Nice, IM in a pretty similar situation, I practice for about 20 minutes, but I normally only do two series for the week and my current IR is 3.1K"
"Is it fair to assume that you’ve been at the service 2-3 years at least and raced all the long-time available tracks? Meaning you just refresh your memory, braking points etc.?

Or can you jump into a brand new track and be competitive after 20 minutes (say 1-1.5s off alien pace?) 

I know some people can, simply wondering if you’re one of them 🤓"
"I’ve done a fair bit of sim racing before this, yeah! but tbh I’ve never taken it as seriously as this! my prior experience is just hot lapping on AC and a little bit of public lobbys in ACC. I also did a 6hr at spa in pcups on AC, so I have had quite a bit of practice with that combo..
and an 8 hour at le mans in iRacing + a 10 hour at daytona on AC again!

T1 at Sebring is a very weird corner, but I watched a lap guide from coach dave academy and it helped so much. Suellio Almeida was the presenter and he gave such good braking reference points which i copied. Definitely always worth watching lap guides.

And i agree on the whole 2k iR thing.. now im 2K, i’m always in high splits and everyone is a second ahead of me! its crazy!

I’m a little nervous about road america tbh as I raced the hpd there a couple weeks ago in proto/gt and had a HORRIBLE time..
I’ll be testing there in the pcup tonight, hopefully with a positive result this time..!"
"Yes, I’ve been on the service for more than 3 years and have been sim racing in general since around the age of 5 or so, so for around 18 years, more competitively in the last 7-8 years. It’s usually more like 1.5 seconds off of alien pace though tbh

Edit: for brand new tracks, it’s usually a little more practice, but not that much more"
"Yeah, similar story for me. I had been sim racing for a few years on AC, ACC. I then sold all my stuff and had a year off. Suddenly got the racing itch again and bought a fanatec DD and gave VR a go. Blew my mind once I got all my settings right. 

Then I finally decided to take the step into iracing. Was proper daunting at first and I felt like a noob but once I settled in, I see what all the fuss around iracing is about. It's such an incredible experience.... also very frustrating at times! 

Just did my first race at road America. Top split 2.5k sof managed to get 11th which I'm fine with. Enjoying the track but it has some super sketchy areas. I'll stick to my usual - 'slow and steady wins the race'  mentality haha. 

Yeah, always watching the coach dave lap guides. Though it doesn't matter how much I watch and copy, I'll still be 2/3 seconds off the pace. I'm fine with that for now though. Happy to be mid splits and just having fun with it."
"thats awesome! i have a vr headset and a 34” ultrawide and i use the monitor a lot more, but i do still love VR. its just a bit of a pain in the ass sometimes so i don’t use it too much. definitely gonna use it for some rally and drifting soon!

I felt the exact same when i first joined iRacing! it was a little overwhelming but wow is it a level up from other sims! 

i’ll be doing my first road america races tonight and i may come back to this thread to briefly go over my results, although i expect them to be bad..

main goal is to get 4.0 safety rating and jump to B class"
"I used to hate vr when I had a rift. After getting wireless pico 4 I've been converted! 

Good luck in your races man! I'm working all eve but will be back at it tomorrow daytime"
"did one race last night, started 16th finished 9th and was very clean. best lap was a 2:10.931. overall pretty happy!"
"Nice one man! Yeah, I'm sitting around 2:10 best laps. Had a nightmare today. Punted into the shadow realm on lap 1. Had to pit for repairs, decided to finish the race 30 seconds behind everyone. Did far worse off in this 1.7k race than the 2.5k. Back at it tomorrow."
I suggest you read the sporting code to explain how it actually works.
"Thx, i read the 3.7.3 and the concept of SR bumper. So i won 0,20 instead of 0,60 in the second race which is still a lot compared with  the figures in the rookies."
"You got that much SR gain because of the number of corners due to a twisty track and a longer 25 min race with a low incident count. 

SR is a score of corners per incident and it’s a rolling score over many corners (like 1000-2000). 

SR has nothing to do with finishing position or how many drivers are in the race."
"Thank you for the explanation.

Then still a good combination for rising SR"
Yeh it is. It can get very messy at times so don’t assume every race will be clean. Participation will be a bit lower than normal at Ruds too.
[DAYTONAAAAAAAAAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF2KFIMeezY)
"Brace yourselves, post of Daytona and Daytona only are coming"
Its been Daytona for 3 weeks already.
LETS GO AWAY
"OP, man, your music instrument must look up.

Me and boys going to Daytona.

D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-
LETS GET AWAY!
Daaaaaytonnaaaaaaaa
Good luck y'all! My daytona is coming in a month :)
"![gif](giphy|eZjrixTYeiCT6)

Every time that song hits"
"Daytona month! Forget January, its Daytonuary"
"You're the luckiest, you get 500 Daytona to our 24 Daytona"
"Literally my first ""sim racing"" experience"
A 24 hours of Daytona oval with NASCAR cars sounds mentally draining haha
"Same Sega Dreamcast. Absolutely friggin’ loved that game.

I guess I played games like some NASCAR game for the Genesis or whatever but Daytona USA was the first game where I felt like I was driving a car."
"Irating is not a predictor of pace. It's a predictor of finishing position. 

Plenty of times I've seen some random 1.7k driver faster than me at 2.2k. But most of the time I finish ahead of them because it's more likely that they will be involved in a wreck."
Math gonna math
"I mean irating indicates more than pace thought. Race craft, consistency etc is also part of it"
I find it uncanny that even though you know Elo rating is called that because it’s Arpad’s last name but still type it as ELO as if it’s an abbreviation.
Iracing does not make use of elo as far as I know. Elo only works for games that are 1v1 and not 1vMany.
"Yep, and you also gain a lot by being able to hold a consistent pace. Even better if you can do that despite having to drive off line, which often happens in races."
"Yep, plenty of 1.5k iR drivers throwing down fast laps. They just can’t string them together."
"Good point, yes its a good predictor of finishing position due to consistency of the higher ranked driver."
"Little known fact, Arpad Elo also played keyboard in Electric Light Orchestra /s"
I mean irating is an elo system. It classes relative skill and is zero sum. Most games with a ranking system use something like this
"Elo is a specific algorithm. Iracings algorithm is based on the same zero sum principles, but it is not elo. You can adapt elo to be used for NvN players, but that would no longer be the elo algorithm"
"I’ve run the race twice, and slept between stints. Last year was super disappointing. Turned the car over with a 2 lap lead over second, went to sleep. Woke up 5 hours later and a teammate had gotten too sleepy to drive but didn’t want to get out and wrecked with a lapper. Cost us 7 laps. Still finished p2."
I'm not racing it this year. But i will typically sleep a bit between stints. Thought typically this is limited to like 3-6h depending on stints.
"Sleep, no question."
"Of course you should sleep in between your stints. Keeps you fresh & ready to drive.

Last year only 2 of my buddy's from karting could do the event. So we extended our stints to 3 in a row so we could get some rest/sleep in between."
I ran my first roar on Saturday and after a double stint I can't imagine how you can go 3-4 stints before swapping. I was wiped out mentally. I think I would have to sleep at least take a nap for an hour or two.
I normally run the overnight from about 12am-6am.  Then I sleep and wake up to see what happened.
"I didn’t, but my teammates did and said they’d wake up to their alarms (they did not 😂)"
You need to sleep. You’ll regret it later in the race for sure.
"Yep - drive and provide support usually for the first 3rd of the race, if I'm not needed for stints too deep into the night I'll go and sleep for 4 or 5 hours depending on when I'm next in (thankfully we are 3 European drivers with one US driver so this works quite well), wake up and finish the race!"
My team does 2 hour stints alternating between drivers. There's gaps where one of us isn't active so we can rest.
"I always did, granted i'm not racing it this year.  


Trust me, even if you think you can muscle through it I would just try to find the time to sleep or get some amount of rest inbetween your stints. Alternatively if you have enough people and everyones onboard to double stint you can try to get away with that. I've done that with varying success."
The key is having a team that is split across the atlantic. That 4-6 hour time zone difference helps a lot
"I’ll be running my first one this Saturday with 4 other drivers. We plan to spot, some sleep or do their daily routine."
"I highly recommend sleeping at least briefly if you wish to perform at your best.


Ideally you want to sleep a minimum of 4+ hours. But even if you can only do a 30-45 or 90+ minute nap, for most people that is going to have a positive impact on performance (as long as you give time to fully wake up). Just avoid between 45-90 minutes, as that can result in grogginess for many people.


There are of course some who can perform better on no sleep than I can fully rested. But I would personally recommend getting some recharge."
"Of course. It’s not easy to actually fall asleep, but I try to sleep a normal amount of if I can, especially if I’m driving again at the end"
"This will sound lame, but I have a single bed in my computer/Sim room for enduros specifically.

Means I don't have to disturb my partner and child walking through the house between the Sim room and bedroom."
I’ve run it twice and I sleep a little but not much. 2 or 3 hours across the whole race. The excitement gives me energy. I’m dead to the world for about 10 hours the next day when I finally crash.
"100% sleep

I stayed up for the entire 2018 Le Mans race we did

I was so lost running the final stint"
"Always did. There have to be two people present - a driver and a spotter/crew person, checking, adjusting, calculating. There's no need for more people so if they want a rest, they can go rest."
"You hit a rhythm where you’re focused on running laps at 85% effort. Everyone becomes super spaced out all you have to really worry about is traffic. The biggest thing is that for outside of the last 20 minutes you’re never really battling on the track like you’d be doing constantly in a shorter race. You’re letting the faster drivers through and the slower drivers are letting you by, there’s really no point to battling someone at hour 8.

Two hours of the ROAR is exhausting because it’s a really long sprint. Two hours in the middle of the D24 is easy because your only focus is on running clean laps and navigating traffic."
"i have two stints, one early, and one like 5-6 hours later, and i’m afraid i won’t wake haha"
"My goal is to find a Le Mans 24 to run later this year, if there is one. I know its not on the iRacing special calendar but I know ive seen some private ones. Next year Daytona 24 preferably in a GT3 car. my iR is not high enough yet to run, 858 after the roar which gave me a nice little bump with a P5 finish. I know most teams wont even accept a sub 1k iR driver for these events"
"Exactly this.

Never did a big endurance on iracing, done a few on AC and its 1000% this.

You only fight yourself really.

I also learned that talking to people about stuff that doesnt concern the Race helping to survive the hours.

After 30/45mins its all about managing yourself, and how much body strenght you have"
Just get a loud alarm to save the overnight driver 😂
"With an iR like that you’re probably very inconsistent, some combination of constantly caught up in traffic or small mistakes adding up. The endurance events will help massively because you’ll get a ton of seat time focused on staying on the track and avoiding incidents all while not having the pressure of squeezing out every last tenth the car has to give. You’ll get that mindset shift where you realize you can go fast even while driving conservatively."
"Im getting more consistent. Top 5 in the last 6/8 races.. but you're right. Lots of 1x or wrong place at the wrong time/no where I could go 4x incidents losing time or having to pit for repairs. 

Im maining the GT4/LMP3 series and running in an LMP3 this season. Results have been much better this season than last. I almost gave up on it last season"
The in-car adjustment page of the black box should show the value if it's adjustable while driving
"You should be able to see it on your car's dash. Otherwise, just leave the black box open."
"Most overlays like racelab have widgets on the relative overlay. You can set that to brake bias. 

It was a godsend during the roar. In the McLaren I ran 53.5% in the bus stop but 52.5% everywhere else. Having the widget was nice to be about to glance over as I was approaching the braking zone to verify I had made the adjustment correctly."
Hit F8.
Some only show the increase or decrease based on what the original bb was. So it will show 0% if you haven't made an adjustment.
"This, and it is adjustable in fixed and shows what the actual % is, not just the relative change (for example: 55.1%). You have to have the black box up to see what you’re changing it to though, no other way as it won’t pop up automatically when you change it."
I wish I could get an overlay to work in VR...
Thanks All!
"Elbows out is one thing, this is just pushing the other guy in the wall"
"indeed, I keep getting dumped and smashed in rookies street stock just trying to survive,  hoping if I just keep working on my self ill end up in better splits or buy into another series"
"meh really comes down to luck of the draw, Ive seen it all from top split to low split  its just your more likly to have a good race in top but if your not the 1% then you'll just have to get use to this kind of stuff .

remember to report it though, Iracing is and will get back to you on it, Shit had a protest get solved within 20 mins this week thats fucking 10/10 support"
"Join our Fixed GT3 league! We run a fun format where we alternate weeks between a double-header sprint night (2 different tracks) and an endurance night. It provides for some great racing opportunites for everyone.

Our grid is made up of drivers that have a wide range of skill and experience with a high focus on safety that leads to good close racing.

We're on our third week.  But we offer two drop weeks, so if you start this week, you'll still be right in the compeition.

Join us this Tues night (tonight!) at 6:30 for a double-header sprint.  Two races on the same night on two different tracks.  We start at Willow Springs for a 30 minute race, then head to Okayama for another 30 min sprint.

Or, join us on a Monday night for an open hosted practice session at 6:30 central US.  Just look for ""OMEC"" in the title.

Here’s the basics of what you want to know:

* Tuesday Nights
* 6:30 Central US
* We alternate weeks between:
* 
* * 90 min endurance (with random full-course yellow)
* * Double-header sprints (two different tracks each week)
* * 8 week season - 2 drop weeks
* 
* 1 “special event” that splits the season

"Every single car in the 25-car-strong field finished without a single incident point, I've literally never seen that before!"
That's chimpanzee at a typewriter writing Shakespeare levels of probability right there!
If this isn't a sign of the end times then I don't know what is.
And it's not even a high SOF race...actually pretty fucking impressive!
Wait wait wait? What????
Holy shit I thought you just meant for you 💀
Lap 18 must have been a fast one!
Sub-2k SoF too. Holy bananas I can't believe this lol
"Thats actually insane. Usually when you get close to that someone hops on the mic to be like ""I just realized we didnt have any cautions!!"" and immediately someone wrecks lol."
This is unbelievable. The odds of no incidents in qualifying alone (2 laps alone on track for everyone) are very low already.
"I wont be fooled draft masters has actually become safe, lol"
The Christmas crowd must be dropping off
Bro go buy some lottery tickets
It's like a dream come true
Congratulations. You just used all your luck for the next 4 and 8/13ths years!
How did you even find this?  This is from 23s4.  Were you just combing through the records?
Post the session # I want to believe this for myself
impressive.
Even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in awhile
Light the beacons. Dark times are upon us.
Clearly photoshopped
The chances of this happening is equal or higher to winning the Powerball Lottery... and people do win the lottery on occasion 
Hell froze over simultaneously didn’t it
"I just tried this tuck for the first time, it's a little jittery. WP"
I once had a race like this in week 13 street stocks at Oxford. Similarly shocking.
Nah this is black magic. The end is near
Damn better go play the lotto
Yup that race was super fun. Really enjoyed it lap 20 was spicy if I remember at the line we went 3/4 wide and still didn't crash.
"Wow, that's unheard of"
I found in Draft Masters the lower SOF are safer. It’s the high IR drivers that want to go 3 wide and dodge in and out of spots or hit you in the back in Gen4 and lift your tires off the ground.
"I literally drove in this race this afternoon, right before I posted the image 😂"
"Mmmmm, beacon "
"This. I’ve found lower iR people are very aware of their inability and seem to be a lot more scared. I got dropped to third split recently, and was amazing someone didn’t barrel into me at the line of the last lap. They just gave me a free run to the line."
Weird that the car is called 23s4.
"Mmmmmmm, pistolwhip"
It’s because it’s the same car from 2023.
"I'm going to learn open wheel oval racing just for this, should be an absolute blast!"
I guess I got 5 months to learn how to drive an IndyCar.
"This will be my first attempt at it, I can't wait.  I imagine just finishing this race will be an accomplishment"
Fun Fact: Back in the day the wind would blow hotdog wrappers onto the track which then would blow in the radiator and cause cars to overheat.
"I live in speedway indiana. The track is about .5 mile from my front door. Never gets old listening to them out there testing come april. The town really comes alive during any event at the track but its unmatched for the 500. RIP that work week tho, takes 2 hours to get home which encompasses 1 mile traveled."
And just like that I bought an Indy car and hit my first 20% off purchase.
Literally during my finals week as a teacher fucking hell trying to do better than my 2022 2nd place is gonna be tough lol
I started iRacing with the sole intention of eventually doing this. A week later they lost the license. So hyped it's back!
I’ll learn everything I need to know 5min before the race.
"I wonder if this is Fixed or Open Setup. Previous years, they had one week dedicated to Fixed and another week for Open"
Q for you all. Is this road license AND oval license needed?
"Wish it was open all week. It’s the most attended sporting event in the world, there’ll be plenty of people who miss bc of travel."
"I’m 2k scrub, should I go do some f4/f3 to get ready for this?"
Can anyone join the race? Or do you have to be a certain irating?
I will have to look. Can you do this as an AI race to practice?
"As long as you learn a few weeks BEFORE the event, it's good. Too many people will discover aero push at turn one"
I bought the ir18 two years ago for this event. Now I drive it all the time. Awesome car.
It's 4
didn't a sandwich wrapper fall in alonso's brake duct forcing his car to retire on his return?
"Welcome to the club, fellow degenerate"
Do it live.
on the forum they said it will be fixed/open in the same week but they will switch to separate weeks for next year like they used to do
"It's an oval race, not a road race. Oval licence needed."
May 27 - Jun 2 is all week or what am I missing?
In past years it’s been C class oval license or higher
Yeah I’ve been doing that
"That's exactly what I'm going to do, I'll probably start now. I know the basics from watching indy car, but it's a whole other world when you're actually driving it"
"Damn, time passes so fast!"
"It was a visor tear-off, but yes, its happened multiple times."
Thank you for the info 🙂
"You’re missing the fact that I simply cannot read haha, thanks for pointing it out. Brain thought it was a Thursday. Hopefully it’s more than 1 split a day."
"Week 7 of this season (one week from later tonight) the USF2000 and Indy Pro 2000 road to Indy cars are racing at the free Phoenix oval. 3 of the 12 weeks for these two series are at ovals.

You might be interested in that too, the cars are slower and the aero wash is dramatically more forgiving than the IR-18’s. It’s a good place to learn open wheel oval racing.

 Also the Indy Pro 2000 on oval tracks is by far the cleanest oval racing I’ve ever come across on iRacing."
Yeah I'm starting end of this month. Don't want to be cramming in practice last minute
Dirty air is massive at those speeds. It catches a lot of ppl out.

"Will be races on Friday, Saturday & Sunday but probably only 1 on Friday & Sunday. Saturday had 2 in the past"
"My brain also has a hard time comprehending dates that span from the end of a month to the next one lmao, my calendar did the work"
"I wish there was more of it, I love the Pro 2000.  Is there  a regular time they go official, I never see them being driven."
If you had to choose one usf2000 or Indy pro 2000? Already have ir-18 and D almost fast tracked to C. Cheers
"US Open Wheel C seems to only go live in evenings Eastern U.S time based on the forums, so if you cant make that then ai it is!"
Hahaha
"Biggest race is Thursdays at 10:00 PM EST with broadcast.

It may or may not go official outside of that depending on the track, but 8:00pm and 10:00pm EST from Monday-Thursday are your best chances of finding races.

Once the track changes itll be at limerock, free track so will probably go official more often"
"They trade off every hour and run the same schedule, so definitely do both cars if you can. Indy Pro 2000 is the same car as the USF, except it's got some extra aero bits, better tires, and about 100 more horsepower, the transition is pretty easy. Especially since you only have to learn one track a week to run both cars.

If I had to pick one, I would pick the Indy Pro 2000."
True... though the same is also true for the actual Indycar unless you're fine only doing the fixed oval series.
"Of course it's Thursdays, that's my DnD night.  I'll check the other ones also, thanks!"
">you only have to learn one track a week to r

awesome! thanks for the info!"
"When I made the switch to load cells, I did an awful lot of racing in AC when I wasn't doing an iRacing slot. Sticking with just one car for a little while to get used to the feel of load cells isn't a bad move since there is a bit of a learning curve switching over. Just do what you feel comfortable with is my suggestion."
You should definitely do some GT4 so you can get a baseline... You know how to race with your old pedals - now compare.. Then once you are comfortable and understand the difference - do whateer you want
Just do some AI races to get comfortable with the new pedals.  It really doesn't take that long.
"So wait, you can run the G series wheel and something like CSL pedals? I was looking this up last night but couldn't find a solid answer"
"That’s sound advice. My main outlook this year is to improve with purpose and patience. Instead of bouncing around trying too many things at once. 

What would you say was the biggest learning difference? I feel in my head it will be either new muscle memory or different reaction by the car, probably both."
"I am about to set them up, but all of my research says yes. You just have to plug the pedals directly into your PC. I got the load cell adapter kit that I think comes with the adapter to do so. I hope it does or I will be waiting a couple of weeks for that to come in…

Edit: Just watched a video and it looks like it comes with the appropriate cable. Heading home now to install."
"I'm not sure. I'm on a G27. I have thrustmaster TLC-M's coming tomorrow - and a MOZA R5 coming sometimes within the next week or so ;)

I have come back into iracing after years of not wanting to pay but grinding the nordschleife in AC or AMS in my spurts of sim racing in between counterstrike so coming back I immediately tried nords in this game and fell in love and now can race anything on any track :D"
Just reboot the computer. That usually solves these types of issues.
If only that pop-up included instructions on what to do next.
Might be a good thing
"You mean the one that offered no suggestions for the issue at hand?

Great input. 

I contacted support before this post. 

Unlike you, they offered a proper solution."
"and what was the solution, in case someone else has the same issue?"
"I mean the one that told you to contact support. As you said, following that instruction solved it."
"https://preview.redd.it/qah4dhoi72dc1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00229c9117dadcade1476243383d35175f8a5461

This did it."
"I just started school again so my schedule is a little tight but I can race for a bit on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Maybe a bit during the week but probably not much. 

I'm a rookie with a D road license but really enjoy dirt oval and legends races."
What irating are you looking for ideally?
"I fluctuate anywhere between 1200-1400, other driver is a bit of an alien and I believe close to 2k. Irating doesn’t concern us all that much. We care much more if you’re looking to have fun and are consistant with the times you are managing to put in. For context buddy is hitting low 1:44’s where as I’m hitting high 1:45’s-low 1:46’s"
My kid is looking for a team. He's A licensed with a 2500 irating.  Hmu if you're interested.
Just dm’d you.
Still looking...
"Search for the series in the UI under the Go Racing Series List.

It's under the Series Info tab."
"Week 6: McLaren 570S GT4 (current week)

Week 7: Pontiac Solstice

Week 8: Radical SR8

Week 9: Ligier JS P320

Week 10: Pro Mazda

Week 11: Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport MR

Week 12: Lamborghini Huracan GT3 EVO"
Week 8 looking really good.
"Found it, thanks buddy 🙂"
Thank you!
might sound weird but I hate right hand drive cars :D i wonder how the Pro Mazda drives like though
"Set my fov to be centered since the radicals are made of paper, anything to avoid contact."
"I drive GT4 in iRacing almost exclusively for a league and the difference in the cars handling between sims is quite drastic, GT4's in AMS2 are quite floaty feeling and very oversteery compared to iRacing in my experience."
"There have been multiple GT4 racers that said the gt4 on iracing feel very realistic to the point where sim racers could jump into the real car and set competitive times very quickly. I believe Daniel Morad has a video about it on his YouTube. 

Other sims behave differently but I personally do not know if it’s better or worse. AC feels disconnected to me and ACC is more like how the iracing MX5 drives imo. Can’t speak for AMS, never driven them on there."
Just wait for week 13 to test drive for free if you’re patient enough
"Ok so it seems driving those cars on other sim would not be a good way to chose which one I prefer… 
Thanks for your answers !"
The gt4 Merc is actually quite similar to ACC.
"I prefer GT3s in ACC by a fair margin, but GT4s in iracing are considerably superior. The cars move around so much more than they do in ACC, heaps more lively and the state of bop for GT4s in ACC is pretty poor."
"LMP3 is another car that real drivers have given iRacing praise for how accurately it drives. 

Which then puts a lot more context around the ""dentist moments"" in IMSA when the P3 is (IMO) the most difficult prototype to drive. "
I don't think I'm that patient...
What kind of overlays are you talking about specifically?
"Only steamVR supports overlays.

For openXR the closest method is kneeboard.

https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard"
"I tried them out with ioverlay, but honestly they were so distracting that I took them straight back off. Theres a guide on their discord and it’s fairly easy to do."
"Thank you for your support...

i will try it with steam VR and I will take a look at it.

But generally I use Steam in iracing...where can I choose steam VR? 

Sorry for my noob questions...but to be honest im a kind of noob in that topic :D"
"for overlays im totally open....I have no experience with overlays and if you have something you can recommend, please do it :) 

I only know overlays from Simlab... u/Dellazal"
"I overlay discord has a guide for getting it to work with kneeboard. I have yet to try it, though."
"Check racelabs discord, overlays are working in OpenXR though not without some effort to setup, but they are quite helpful.

Also FYI, steamvr supports both OpenVR and OpenXR runtimes."
oh nice...not even one overlay piece? .can you maybe help me in installing it?
"Not for me no, I could have persevered and got used to it I guess, but I didn’t feel it added enough to be worth it. 

I don’t have a G2, so I’m not sure I’d be much help, but their website has a link to discord and there’s guides on there"
Are you still looking for drivers?
Yes we are! currently with 4 drivers you're more then welcome! You can join via the link to the discord server.
Yeah they should start the fixed 10 minutes later.
"With difficulty, with registration at a pit stop during the race, but possible.

If you like long races in GT4, also take a look at the League: [https://tieracing.net/gtendurance/](https://tieracing.net/gtendurance/)"
Would be nice if the race registration was on an open API. You could at least write some software and hook it up to a streamdeck etc then. Alt-Tabbing during a race is a huge PITA.
"It's possible, you need to alt tab during the race, but it's possible. Watch Casey Kirwan's stream, he does it all the time"
"Baisc Oille on YT

https://youtu.be/wVafFhgMOf8?si=GyE_OuAmxf8p4s6x"
But then you'd have the same overlap now just going from fixed to ope. Instead of open to fixed. Plus all races start only in 15min intervals 
Is it possible to register to an event while racing another one? I didnt know it.
"**Yeah, you need to click Withdraw in the UI when you loaded into a race session, and then register in a new one while you are at the pit stop.**"
I think the status changes to Forfeit since I enter an event. Am I wrong?
"You're right, click on Forfeit, but the point remains the same. The only thing is that you must already be in the session. And if the game crashes, then you won’t be able to return."
I wouldn't do it to be honest.
"If you're worried about getting a DNF due to it, don't. All the forfeit button does is stop you from being able to rejoin if you close the sim. The race itself only ever cares about where your car is, you can forfeit on lap 1 and still win the race, it'll count as a win."
Thats how everyone does it my guy
"It's safe (as long as you don't drop connection). It's been done for ages, primarily by oval drivers but it's fine elsewhere "
"Random spawn.

Sucks though. I hate those careless people."
"Fyi, Snippet Tool (already installed on your PC) has a video screen capture that is very easy to use."
I was watching a streamer in my race and that lmp2 got punted in t1 and then did that but on my screen he just appears out of nowhere
"He got pushed off at turn 1, the way iRacing renders cars it's possible he didn't know anyone was coming onto the oval. (See how he randomly appeared for OP, it was likely the same from the other POV).


Only strange thing in my opinion is why he didn't turn it around, I'm sure the penalty would have been insane if not a dq for cutting the entire infield."
"Ty, will use this for future clips"
"Either way, he's rolling, and it doesn't seem like he's putting on the brakes. Some people act careless once their races get ruined."
"For some reason, over on the iracing forums Charlotte Legends Long gets pooped on as one of the worst Vee tracks. Which is insane, because it’s so great. "
"I’ve stopped running the Vee, but you make me curious maybe I’ll give it a go this week."
"The Vee/ff1600 schedule is a lot of fun.

Sliding those cars around turns is a blast"
Just completed a race on this track for this car after having a hell race at Lime Rock last night this was a breath of fresh air. First podium in road as well.
"the 1600 was a blast - I was just wheeling it around the roval while teaching my buddy iracing. Sold me on the car. Sooo fun. It's actually just a big go kart. I havent tried the vee yet. I was using H pattern and clutch with the 1600, very fun lol."
The legends long road course? It was my absolute favourite rookies track too. A damn shame garbage like Oran Park is in the same schedule
It’s got some corners I’m having a hard time deciding between if I should be in 2nd or 3rd gear. TBH I feel like it’s either I’m redlining 2nd or barely in 3rd and neither feel comfortable. Other than that it’s a blast.
Do it!
Congrats!
I’m having fun with the 1600 on this week’s series track too. Can’t wait to get done with work today and get out there.
"> A damn shame garbage like Oran Park is in the same schedule

Oran Park is one of my favourite tracks on iRacing."
I love oran
"Yea legends RC Long.

Its definitely a course where you are very actively driving nearly the entire time.

I didn't think Oran park was bad. I completely skipped Summit Point - Jefferson Circuit after a handful of practice laps."
"I’m not sure, still a bit new at this hehe"
Rule of thumb is you pretty much never want to be in 2nd in the Vee. It’s only for super tight hairpins really. 
Yeah i can REALLY feel that car. You can turn hard and then catch the slide with some nice gas pedal modulation.. You can really feel how much the brakes effect your turn in. It's actually a super cool car to learn on. Big GO kart.
Hop on the forums as well - thats probably your best bet. Reddit works with decent success but the forums is where its at for finding teams.
Im also looking for a team
"Update via iRacing UI, not steam. As soon as you can, switch off of steam all together."
Check your Anti-Virus. When I downloaded from steam I had two files reported as PUPs that stalled the download.
Disk space?
i didnt know that is possible. i thought you can only play via steam when you sub via steam. i will try this thank you very much
Your current contract carries over if you email iRacing. That’s what I did. I was always a steam user and it’s just a worse experience
thank you so much friend. I am writing an email to iRacing now.
"Have you tried opening the sim with OpenXR instead of Oculus? For me, OpenXR looks 1000x better than the default Oculus. I have no idea why, in fact, I dont even know what OpenXR technically means. All I know is it works lol"
"Id if it's the same on the Q3, but on the Q2 you have to manually set up the resolution to 1.5x and the refresh rate to 90 (or even 120)in the Oculus software.

1x resolution doesn't look that good, 1.5 is crisp though"
"ACC looks like dog water in VR no matter what you do  but I find iracing looks pretty crispy and good.

Depends what gear you have and what settings you’re using. In iracing I just cycled through the presets and made sure I was using the real mirrors till I was happy with how it looks/performs. Using 3090 and 10900k.

Keep in mind that the graphics will always be worse than what you can get on flat screens. I wish I had the space for flat screens but compromised and went for VR."
Are you using it wireless or with a cable? Have a friend who recently started using one and he said the quality difference between airlink and cable is immense.
Virtual desktop and openxr. It's the only way I can play in VR.
"Will be needing more info than this if you would like some help. Anyway yea, specs and your method of playing as in Link, VD etc. ACC has always looked terrible in VR though as the engine doesnt work well for it. Really need to crank the settings up in that along with a beefy GPU. All about the super sampling if your PC can do it."
"How is the quality of the image when you're inside the Quest 3 home, before connecting to your PC? If you find it shit there too, then make sure your IPD is set correctly, and that the headset sits correctly on your face. If it's still shit, then I guess just resell the headset.

If the image is only shit while inside iRacing, then it's either your connection to your PC (especially if you use air Link) or your in-game settings."
"I have the Rift S and I was thinking about buying the quest 3 as I never thought about using a screen after trying VR… I even have a ultra wide 49 inch one

What do u hate and what do you miss?

I do agree that it took some time to set up, with overlays and all but what are your specific pain points?"
"I'll ask you one question: is this the first vr headset you try?
If yes then maybe the VR quality is not just there yet for you.
If no, you're probably blind cause there's not much better than quest3 at the moment (especially at that price point).

Also looking like dog shit is not exactly helpful for people to help you out. 
I'd say if you don't at least see any potential in the thing, just sell it and try again vr in 3 years"
"It's personal. I've had a Reverb G2. They are somewhat comparable: [https://www.pcguide.com/vr/meta-quest-3-vs-hp-reverb-g2/](https://www.pcguide.com/vr/meta-quest-3-vs-hp-reverb-g2/) 

.. so I sold it again after a year. Never liked it. It's a good VR though, I loved playing Half-Life: Alyx. Awesome picture quality. But for simracing, it's nowhere near enough resolution for me. My buddy who also races iRacing, has the same Reverb G2, and he uses it for 3 years now. He loves it.

I guess VR isn't ready enough to your liking yet for simracing. At least that's how I currently see it. I'd love way more resolution, foveated rending at least, and a much more FOV.

I noped out of VR quickly and jumped back to my 32"" triples."
"Try out AMS2, if it looks bad there then there is something really wrong "
"I am using Q3 and its goregous. Took a while to dial in VR settings I could maintain 90FPS on but eventually got smooth 90 on every track (7950XD + 4080) and it looks great. Its not quite as nice as Turismo in VR, but its close."
"To make ACC look good you need a very strong PC, and to do some research how to configure it and openxr toolkit. For iracing it shouldn’t be too much of astruggle, there’s a whole guide for quest on iracing forum that you can follow."
"If you have never used VR before - even Quest 3 will feel as an downgrade in fidelity compared to screens - Until the moment you get used to the depth perception in Racing Games. At that point, lower fidelity is not an issue.

If you have used Quest 2 or similar headset, Quest 3 is massive upgrade!

Edit: I was using Oculus CV1 and upgraded to Quest 2 and it was massive upgrade! I believe going from Q2 to Q3 will be similar jump!"
"Definitely need to use openXR and fine tune the settings along with upping the bitrate in oculus tray tools to at least 500, make sure you have x4 aa at least and sharpening on in iracing, boost your headset res to highest it can go, use ai up scaling to boost it even further, use foviated rendering and move the sweet spot/center upwards

There are YouTube vids that cover all of the above"
"I’ve helped people with vr settings on my old Reddit account, and I’ve been racing in VR with a quest 2 daily on twitch since April. haven’t used a quest 3 yet but I like my quest 2. Different things seem to work for everyone, here’s what works for me: 

Lots of top comments saying to use openxr and modify your oculus settings. for me that’s always made things worse in iracing. I plug in link cable, enable oculus link (not virtual desktop) and then launch the sim through oculus mode (not openxr). Virtual desktop, airlink, openxr, etc all get stutters and blurry for me. 

Aside from that, remember to wipe the lenses with your shirt every once in a while between races because it gets foggy. Hope this helped"
Fuck there's 100s of comments op hasntveven given his spec.lots of busy idiots here.
ACC can look great but you need to go digging in the forums for a config vr file that works for you. Iracing just needs tweaks from the vr forum. With the Q3 I find that the quality is greatly improved upto 1080p monitor standards.  Its come along way
"For me the gamechanger with Iracing was to use it with openxr and download openxr toolkit. Then with the toolkit to push render resolution higher (I use now around 3300-3400px / eye). What else i did was in a) meta quest link set the encode bitrate to 500mb then b) set iracing graphics so that i was not botlenecked by my cpu at 90fps(that is easy to check when you have open xr toolkit metrics). Then raise render resolution with openxr toolkit as high as your graphics card enables you to do. Then set turbo mode on in openxr toolkit just for safety for sudden cpu based frame drops. In that way I can get constant 90 fps and in my opinnion a crisp and good looking game. But as is said, there will be small blurriness in the horizon whatever you do."
Im using a 4090 with 5800X and IR on Quest 3 looks 100% as sharp and nice as on my 3 1440p 32”. Perhaps your PC can’t handle VR at Quest 3 levels or you weren’t patient enough to research on Youtube alone best setups for IR on Quest 3.
"The big questions I have are: 

1. What Gpu are you using?
2. What connection to your PC? Link, Air-link, VirtDesktop?
3. Which runtime when you start the game- OpenXR or Oculus or OpenVR (steam)

IRacing was good for me with a 3080ti. ACC was not so much.

IRacing with OpenXR was a revelation for me. Steam seems to be the least optimized runtime. 

The connection btw the headset and PC can make difference since the picture be sent compressed (a la YouTube). The more bandwidth the less severe the compression artifacts you will see. WiFi (Airlink and virtual desktop)  is like… 1.2Gb/s. A good usb link cable is like 2.3-2.7Gb/s

I am happy with a good link cable every time since it also charges the quest pro."
What GPU do you have? A lot of AMD GPU's don't work well together with the Quest.
"Why do you post about ACC on an iRacing sub? iRacing lacks in terms of graphics compared to other sims in flat screen, but in VR it looks stunning. Don't touch ACC, the engine is not optimized for VR, it looks worse and runs like shit (speaking as a 4090 owner). Just stick to iRacing with OpenXR (not SteamVR!) and modded AC.

I myself use Quest 3 (wireless via Virtual Desktop) in iRacing and won't go back to ultrawide ever."
Poor guy. Probably watched VR YouTube videos with filters and color correction and thought that's what he was going to see.
"Honestly on iRacing I struggle too. I seem to have to make so many compromises to get any kind of framerate, by which time the immersion is lost because it 'looks' like a computer game - actually I find iRacing's graphic to be a bit 'gamey' anyway. Both iRacing and ACC tend to look like everything's really small too, like the scale/proportions are just not like real life.

There are things you can do, but it's not straight forward. Look at using 'Virtual Desktop', make sure you try a quality high speed link cable and definitely look into OpenComposite and OpenXR Tools - these have made it playable for me and with the OpenXR toolkit you can adjust that world scale so everything looks a more realistic size.

OR

Stop struggling with iRacing and ACCJust play AMS2 instead when you fancy some VR - it looks **incredible**. Reiza put a ton of effort into the VR experience and it shows, it really is everything you want it to be and super immersive. You make less compromises on quality and you get a world scale slider in game so you can make those adjustments on the fly. Highly recommend before you give up on it.

Not sure what specs you're rocking, but I'm using a 3080, i9-10850K, 36GB RAM and running it with OpenComposite via 3rd party Link Cable. I squeeze everything out of that 3080 though, a better GPU will surely help.

hmu if you need any help"
"ACC looks fantastic to me on quest pro.  Stable 90fps with pretty decent graphics.   4090/13900.

Iracing looks like a n64 rendered potato no matter what I do or tweak."
"i like IRacing because of Nurburing and ML cars, but last 2 month start work glitchy and i start hate"
Yeah I had a Q3 for exactly one week before I sold it and went back to my triples
This is what I am worried about when G2 stops working with windows..
[removed]
"""I told you so"" lol

As a VR enthusiast, virtual reality while sitting in a simrig and interacting with the game essentially the same way you would with regular simracing isn't what VR was made for

I simrace on monitors, and save my VR for actually room scale VR experiences which is the entire point of VR. Some people don't realize that simracing in VR literally reduces VR to it's absolute worst state lol it becomes a monitor strapped to your head with head tracking. You don't actually interact with the world around you in simracing VR. You're hold the same steering wheel and pressing the same buttons you would be if you played on monitors. It's just a waste of time imo lol 

Lots of VR simracing people think that's the best use for VR and those people are incredibly low IQ objectively. I have grown to literally hate them because they won't stfu about it.

edit: idiots in my replies lol someone just said you NEVER get to walk in VR despite me doing it for the last decade lol you are all old and stupid."
"If you are using AirLink, detailed games like iRacing looks bad.
Just try with a great cable.

Also, there are some settings on debug tool that improves a little bit.

Also, if you have a powerful GPU, turning up upscaling also helps a lot."
Did you have a vr headset before?
"I use a quest 2 and the graphics aren’t great by no means but it gets job done and the gameplay experience is much greater for me personally, I feel like I got my moneys worth."
"My VR settings, i tried to optimize for frame rate, I recently upgraded my CPU upgrade, so can probably turn things up now.

Might help, might not. 

https://i.imgur.com/ibOXFAU.png"
If you use the oculus option it turns all the graphics down to bare bones stuff. If you use open vr it seems to keep some of the graphics turned on. You’ll have to mess with the settings.
"I play ACC in VR and it looks great but you must configure it properly: https://www.reddit.com/r/ACCompetizione/s/hxkrX7n4In

In a nutshell you need to use quest link with a good quality cable, configure the meta app on Windows properly, set up oculus dev tool (extremely important) and set the in game settings accordingly.

Another guide that works well: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2932276145

Just try this and tell us.

I run it at 90Hz on a Quest 3 with a RTX 3080, 5600X and 32GB of ram."
What’s in your PC? It takes some tweaking with all the guides that everyone else posted. If that doesn’t fix it then it’s your computer bottlenecking you.
"ACC needs a NASA grade PC and a lot of tweaking, time and patience to get it looking crisp (for ACC standards).

iRacing is the sharpest looking of all in VR, I use a Reverb, if it's looking like the camera of a DS something must be setup incorrectly."
Make sure your headset has a good connection bandwidth to your pc. True usb 3.0 or full bars wifi 6
"Pass through is great, I can use my phone with my headset on. That's a game changer to me."
"If you are like me, there is nothing you can do. VR definition (Google ""PPI resolution"") is miles away from the quality of a screen. My Pimax 5k super ended on eBay and I am back to triple."
"Are you coming from never trying vr before or is this an upgrade? Unfortunately for pcvr on the quest it’s terrible out of the box and there’s tons of settings you need to charge first before you get the most out of the headset. it depends on how you’re connecting USB, airlink or virtual desktop. But on all of them you need to increase the resolution that step one then there’s 1 million of other little things that you can do to make it look way better but once you have it dialed in it should look pretty good. But again if you are coming from never trying VR before the expectations may be too high."
"The visuals on the quest 3 in iRacing are terrible to me too. Cars are all kinda blurry I guess? Hard to describe, shimmery maybe. No idea what setting to chsnge"
"AMS2 was in my experience the best looking in VR. But VR always looks a bit worse than the fidelity of screens because the resolution of VR just is not yet to the level of 4k or even 1440p displays relative to the viewing distance. 

VR is a sacrifice in raw visual fidelity and resolution in exchange for absolute immersion."
"If you're using the Link cable, make sure you open the OculusDebugTool and set the Encode Bitrate (Mbps) to something like 350-500. It makes a huge difference and basically gets rid of any compression artifacts. I can't believe that at this point it's not a more prominent setting in Oculus software.

Edit: Keep in mind that forcing the encode bitrate this high may make AirLink real laggy and you might need to set it back to 0 for AirLink to behave properly again."
Pimax is the answer.
"What gpu do u have ?

There s a thread guide about vr performance settings guide on the iracing forums , it s pinned in the vr category iirc , its very long pdf but if u follow that i think u ll have a very good time . Also i suggest using virtual desktop over airlink if you re wireless , for wired just use link but i still use virtual desktop cause its much easier to use ."
"Iracing should look fine. But to be honest, for quality vision you need a pimax. I went from quest 2 to pimax, difference is nights and day"
It'll take time but it gets better hahaha make sure you use a USB 3.2x2 cable and play w the oculus debug tool
I appreciate you have a ton of responses but if you see this DM me and I'll help you set it up.
Are you playing through Airlink or virtual desktop? You should be playing theory virtual desktop with VDXR. what type of router do you have?
"If you have a router with WiFi 6E and you can connect your pc with an ethernet cable, go with Virtual Desktop. I can get 120fps without stuttering but the CPU was running a little hot so I turned it down to 90fps. 

Iracing, and AMS2 have been a blast with VD."
"ACC needs a lot of tinkering and it's poorly optimized. I needed an RTX 4090 to get it to look good. iRacing is alright, but needs to be tinkered with quite a bit as well and requires a solid PC too for VR usage. The best looking and best optimized is Automobilista 2 by a landslide. I recommend that you check it out, especially with how much the IA improved with the recent updates. Mind you that I use a Valve Index so the comparison isn't right as your headset has a higher resolution and you need extra tinkering due to the whole Oculus to PC link thing, but still."
"You can make VR look ok with enough power to your hardware, but it’s not going to look mind blowing, no matter what hardware or headset you have.

I have the best of everything and was never really happy with VR."
Try virtual desktop and open XR. With a 4090 and a with 6E router I’m getting reverb G2 level visuals (as far as I can tell) and solid 120 fps and latency of 36 ms sometimes 28 ms. Which is G2 territory
"To start with the disclaimer, these is my personal opinion, great if you like VR, I salute you, even envy you that you can enjoy what is currently on the market. Second I don't know if you have problems with running the game in some OK way or just issues with maturity of VR as tech in general, I assume you are bothered with the second.

If you are used to fidelity of normal screen the VR will be shit. Immersion, nonparallel , first time I raced Spa in AC on Rift DK2 (so where everything was potato quality) I was well that's it, this is the future. Last set I played with was Vive Pro 2, everything is better, but it is just not there (yet?). I can't glance the mirrors, I have to center the view there. And everything 100 meters or so ahead of car is fuzzy. I enjoyed playing and sweating in Beat Saber, getting sick in that climbing game etc, but for racing it just didn't click for me, I returned it after 3 days. And it's not the engine, it's the lenses, the resolution, how inconvenient it was during long stints, the extra steps before I was on the track, the whole VR package.

I don't know when and how will they solve it, but once they do I'm gonna throw away all the screens and VR take my money. For now I just find too big of a step backwards with image quality to justify all the other compromises."
User error bro.  Up your pixel density in the oculus diag tool and put your device on 1.5x resolution.  If your machine doesn't turn into magic smoke then your unit is defective 
"If you are using Oculus as the VR driver (or whatever it's called) go into the device settings and crank up the resolution to 1.5x From what I understand that is the native resolution for the headset, it will look crystal clear after that."
"I also tried it with the quest 2 but the quality and frame rates made it unplayable for me. I was struggling to get 70fps on a 3080 .

I really tried to tinker the settings and used all the tools recommended on some tutorials, just wasn’t sharp enough for me , it’s a shame because the in car experience was amazing."
Following this. I have a quest 3 that is gathering dust. I hated it. Now i will retry with the suggestions
"Yoooo! Have a search for my post asking for help with my quest a week or so ago. There were some great tips in there and I’m now really enjoying mine. Plus, the mixed reality stuff and the mega store is awesome. Some great games in there. 

You need to modify the oculus ini file in iRacing to give it all the ram and vram. You then need to use the debug tool to make a few changes, there’s a couple of good videos on YouTube. There’s also some changes you need to make in steam VR and the oculus app. You also need to make sure you are connected via USB 3."
I know a lot of people that have had this issue and it turns out they had there headset plugged in but hadn’t had the cable link thing turned on in the software and were using airlink instead despite it being plugged in
"As someone who has a Varjo Aero, I’ve gotten to the point where I prefer the Q3. With virtual desktop, this headset is amazing. Way easier to use and it looks very sharp. Not as sharp as the aero, but on balance it’s a better experience."
"My guess is expectations are too high.

If he's coming from ACC with mods and this is his first VR headset, yea, it looks comparatively bad."
Try going to YouTube. A guy did a complete walk through with air link and with the cable as well. He shows how to adjust your resolution as well so that it doesn't look like dog shit.
You still need to plug it into your pc for iracing
I feel the same way with my valve index
"I'm just repeating what others have said, but to add my experience in case others are sitting on the fence with VR: I've been on VR in iRacing for a few days now with a new Quest 3 and I can't ever see myself going back, the immersion and feeling of being ""in the car"" is just too good. With that said, if you ever expected the fidelity of a good monitor through a current consumer VR headset, you've come into this with unreasonable expectations.

For me, the immersion and depth of VR outweighs the fidelity of a monitor(s) multiple times over. Of course, opinions will vary.

My setup in short, pretty standard: connected via cable. 1.5x resolution in the Oculus app at 90Hz. Bitrate 500-700 Mbps in the Oculus Debug Tool (with other setting adjustments as per the pile of recommendations online). Run via OpenXR in iRacing. All graphics settings pretty much maxxed and I maintain a stable 90fps (granted I do have a high end PC).

If it's not for you, it's not for you, but I'm absolutely loving the VR experience in iRacing."
Play Walkabout Minigolf and then try to tell me the Q3 is a letdown LOL
"It's really important to use a link cable, to disable ASW in ODT, up the bitrate in ODT to 450 or more. Set the slider in the Oculus app to Max and 90hz (unless you are comfortable at lower fps, I feel sick below 90 in racing). You can turn down the FOV tangent numbers a little bit to avoid the rendering beyond what the lenses can see, how much varies by IPD, but it can save a few frames.  iRacing looks much cleaner and nicer in VR than ACC. AMS2 is also really good in VR. The oculus driver supports Openxr (it can be enabled if you've disabled it within the Oculus app settings). I find openxr improves performance. "
Make sure you have a PC powerful enough to do VR. Mine don’t look good until I got my 3090 and 5900x. It still lags.
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmIyhl36jI8&t=165s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmIyhl36jI8&t=165s)

I followed this and mine looks amazing"
"Idk about ACC but reg AC I can easily keep bout 75fps looks great, Im picky so Im sure anybody would be happy with this performance, but I did have to fuck around with settings and all that everyones already asked all the questions so just do your research and figure it out"
"ACC I totally understand; that sim is still dogshit optimized for VR. IRacing though? That's a bit strange since it is crazy well-optimized for VR. Do you have an NVidia GPU? If yes make sure to click on the ""SPS"" option as it can DRAMATICALLY increase VR performance (does some sort of wizardry where it only renders one half of the scene then figures out the other side). 

Other than that, I'd make sure you are running in OpenXR and not the Oculus API. It just runs way better in my past testing with the Quest2 and honestly all VR HMDs (G2, Valve Index, and Vive Pro)."
What are your pc specs? Could be more with that than the headset.
With virtual desktop app + openXR and WFi 6E the VR work very well
Can oculus debug tool be run in conjunction with OpenXR?
You can get iracing to look pretty good on those things with the settings. ACC don’t even bother
"When I bought them I had the same feeling, use the debug tool, and render at 1.1 or more (you will need to change this option every time you start the computer), and then the bitrate as high as you can, also disable the aw or something like that (warpening?) Use openxr so you can use foveated rendering and save resources

And yes, it looks like a Nintendo DS camera it's only 4mp per camera, but it goes better with more light"
"I use Quest 3 and moved from a HP Reverb G2, You need to change settings and do some research because for me it's amazing crisp clear and runs solid at 90fps.

Remember you do need a pretty strong PC for VR sim racing with top end resolutions, as for passthrough, don't know where you have been reading but most people don't think much of the pass through, but for the price of the headset its about where the quality should be."
">I dont even know what OpenXR technically means

You can think about it like graphic api Vulcan vs DX. OpenXR is a new, open source standard supported by shitload of companies (amd, ms, meta, valve, htc and many others), it's honestly what we needed from the start instead of closed Oculus that no one else used."
"Idk what magic VD uses, but I can't even play MSFS with the link cable. Looks like shit, studders like crazy. With VD it's much better. The fact that I have a better experience wireless with VD Open XR blows my mind."
"i just used OXR for MSFS. i could not get in an airliner without insane low frames and near vomit nausea. OXR downloaded and setup, can fly even helis in detailed cities with very minor tearing. Still not perfect but from unplayable to borderline perfect. It’s magic"
Do I still need oculus running to use openXR? I had issues today that caused me to miss the start due to the oculus software not wanting to load into the headset
How did I not know this?! Been using a Quest 2 for years and just figured the low resolution was just a hardware limitation... Can't wait to try this out!
Oculus software doesn’t have a setting for 120hz. I recommend Virtual Desktop for that and also the best experience.
Does anyone here happen to know if it is indeed the same for quest 3? I was trying to change the resolution the other day but had no idea what to make it even after looking things up.
How do I do this? Is it a setting in iracing or the oculus app?
"Ever tried a G2? 

The only problem I've ever run into with any games, is lack of video card to make it look better lol. It's a beast of a sim headset. 

I'll tell you what, mini golf has never looked nicer in VR with it, that's for sure haha"
"ACC absolutely doesn't look like dogshit in VR if you know how to set it up, unless you are expecting 4K images."
"Follow the links in my comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/RFB9Fg7PPL

There is no reason for ACC to look rubbish with the proper set up. I run a weaker system and play the game fine. In fact, I now play it exclusively in VR."
I think high settings and heavy dlss made ACC quite nice(relatively speaking)
ACC looks great on my G2 with open composite
"Even though I have a really high end router, I only use the Link cable. Maybe it's because I have an AMD card, but AirLink was very close to unplayable for me. Using the Link cable was literally transformative. I won't use my Quest 3 without it."
Airlink is unplayable. You have to use a cable if you want it playable.
"more upvotes for openXR, its the only way"
I've seen virtual desktop recommended what does it do?
"I just bought a Rfit S a couple weeks (give or take?) ago.

I borrowed it from a coworker originally just to see what iRacing in VR was like. 3 races in I was fully converted. That's even before I got my settings to a place where it actually looks decent. 

I am running a liquid cooled core i5 10600kf and a 2080ti with 32gb of DDR4. It's not the most modern system. 

I'm getting a pretty steady 80fps (that's the Rift S native refresh rate) and it's quite playable. Screen door effect exists but I forget about it by the time I'm 1-2 laps into practicing. 

The resolution is quite low compared to my nearly brand new 27"" 2k monitor. Things way off in the distance are definitely not what I would call crisp. But being able to look to the apex, being able to actually use my mirrors (when you shift your head around the reflection moves just like IRL mirrors), being able to actually look through corners at Okayama and being able to actually look at a car you're going into a corner side by side with, all these things outweigh the reduction in native resolution, imho. 

It did take a while to really dial in super sampling and smoothing and settings in iRacing. I'm sacrificing a little bit of quality settings compared to running my monitor. 

All of the graphical issues, all of the problems inherent with the native resolution, in my opinion, they're all insignificant compared to the increased immersion and situational awareness compared to a single monitor. Then there are little things you can do that you can't even with triples. Like being able to shift slightly left or right to look around your A pillar. Being able to shift your head around slightly to increase the visibility in your side mirrors, being able to look out your rear windows when trying to gage if a rejoin is safe. 

Sorry for the novel. I'm just huge into VR."
"I’m a quest 3 owner here as well and had a rift and rift s a couple years ago and loved them and sadly took a break from VR. So over all at least from what I remember, tracking is improved on the quest 3 in comparison to the rift s. I feel like I have less issues reaching over the shoulder for things and so on. Display is fine. It’s hard to remember since it’s been so long, but it feels similar to my rift s. I thought I would I be playing the quest without a cable more often, but the games don’t look nearly as good not connected than with a cable so I end up playing with a cable 99% of the time since I can’t do airlink with my internet restrictions. It does make me wish I had considered a wired headset instead sometimes but it’s still is pretty nice to me overall. Graphics are decent in a lot of games and honestly most of my gripes and mostly cause I don’t remember definitively what my rift s looked and felt like"
"I upgraded from rift S to q3. It’s way better imo. The only downside is that it’s slightly more cumbersome to setup before using it each time(need to open tray tool etc). You also need to buy a special cable to keep the battery charged while using it. 

The image is better and I feel like the headset is also lighter."
I use ioverlay and keep having a hard time getting them to stay when I jump back into iracing on another day. Any suggestions?
"I’m not op but I’ve been playing on an original HTC Vive for over 5 years. It looks and plays fine. I expected the Quest 3 to be a major upgrade. It looks and performs way worse to me. I spent a couple hours tweaking settings and messing with debug tools, VD, and oculus settings, and I just gave up. You shouldn’t have to make those compromises imo. Driving wirelessly stutters. People on the forums suggest a special kind of router and to use it exclusively for VR. Again, you shouldn’t have to do that. The old og vive plays and looks ten times better without any of that. It’s very frustrating."
Ah yeah to me VR for racing is amazing but I can totally see why some can’t do it as well. Tech is in a amazing yet meh spot right now for VR
100% this AMS2 runs so well in VR and doesn't need some NASA PC to look good like ACC.
"For ACC, OpenXR toolkit looks worse than properly set up with Meta and Oculus Dev Tool. See the links in my commebt for proper guides: https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/RFB9Fg7PPL"
You can increase the worldscale in VR. I set mine to 120% using ToolkitXR and that looks a ton better for me.
Try virtual desktop on VDXR mode godlike with a WiFi 6E router
"OP hate to burst your bubble but VR aint plug in and play…


Setting up Vr takes time, the quality of VR in iRacing is absolutely fantastic. My Quest 2 looks brilliant. For example my oculous ini file is what I have spent time on and if I switch to openVR or OpenXR theres a lot of configeration required to get to the same sweat spot.

VR is a PC performance hog, more taxing than tripples. I’m on 13600k 32gbddr5 and 3080ti (but used to run low settings with my 6700k 2070 build)

Basically:

 if you have space for tripples then the bonus is less fatigue in long sessions and great ease of use for overlays.

If not then Vr is incredibly emersive on a small footprint, much more tiring but cool as fuck"
Properly setup vr is more than playable and very competitive. I have a 2070 super 12400f i5 and the quest 2. If you can't get it working on anything next to my specs or above you are doing it wrong.
"lol. Everyone else must have low IQ cos i had the worst experience setting up my VR.

Sounds like your the one with low IQ buddy, lots of people doing absolutely fine in VR.  It aint perfect, but you sound proper butt hurt that you couldn't get yours working."
"Simracing is actually one of the best usecases for VR. You're static, which means you never have to worry about limited amount of space, but you are INSIDE of the world you're in. It's the most life-like VR. experience you're going to get.

And I say that as a triple screen enjoyer."
"That’s personal. For me, simracing and flight sim are the best experience I ever had in vr."
Wow.. just wow.
You might want to turn off HDR in those settings. There is a great guide in the VR section on the Iracing forum explaining all these settings.
"How does pass through work? I’m considering getting a quest 3 but saw windows is discontinuing mixed reality support. Will that affect it?

Being able to see my button boxes, phone, wheel… would be amazing"
See I can't. The phone is super overexposed and with enough squinting i might be able to make out some text but mostly its just a grainy mess.
Is it the textures on the cars or are the lines all jagged? If it's the textures then maybe increasing the dedicated memory use will fix that.
"Couldn’t have explained it any better myself. I think the technology is amazing and the immersion is not even comparable to any triple screen or large wrapped screen setup. And though it’s come a long way, it just hasn’t advanced to the point where I’d throw away all of my monitors and daily the vr setup. Especially for competitive racing.

But if buying it for standalone use, I think that it’s amazing."
"I've been doing VR on bare minimum settings, would openxr allow me to bump that up to something nice while keeping a good frame rate?"
Have you tweaked settings in the oculus debug tool? I would say wireless and link cable are about on par.
It's because the oculus PCVR software is dogshit and written ten years ago for the CV1. the oculus software that runs in the background with airlink or cable link is huge resource hog and meta hates their PCVR users so they will never fix it.
I am also shocked at how well it works for me
"Yes. You still need it. If you have issues getting into vr, a quick fix is to restart the oculus server (not just the app). Install oculus tray tool - you can use it via right click to quickly restart the server. You can also use it to automate settings like disable ASW and set FOV tangent. "
Let me know if you see a difference :)
"It does for Quest 2

https://imgur.com/a/JkXATFo

Maybe not for the 3 but it would be surprising for the latest one to not have it"
In the Oculus software on your pc
"Yes.  ACC still looks like dogshit.  And, despite looking awful, also performs awfully too.  Hitting 90FPS is a pipe dream outside of the menus."
"I got a Quest3 for Christmas, if I stick with the VR thing, I’m 100% getting a dedicated PCVR headset"
"I’m a G2 user and love it for most things. VR is always a compromise compared to a flat screen but ACC looks truly terrible
In comparison to other racing games. That’s including using OpenXR and shenanigans with the ini file."
"Agreed. ACC, in fairness, was the most difficult sim for VR optimization but I got it not only looking great but running smooth. And this is on a Rift S with a 2080 card. 

iRacing was a walk in the park in comparison. I would suggest OP use the VR software for upscaling if performance isn’t limiting, or look at some YouTube videos on in game settings otherwise. I know the Quest 3 has become a very popular sim racing headset, surely there’s setup content out there."
"It looks OK, not good, absolutely not great. Compare it to other sims and you see what actually looks great.

ACC post processing and anti-aliasing just fucks up in VR. Popping shadows, blurry edges, etc. It's very immersion breaking compared to the rest of the sims."
It most certainly doesn't look great.  There's fundemental issues with ACCs entire rendering approach that makes it incompatible with good looking and good performing VR.
"*for some people

My experience has also been that link cable is the only way for me, but that's not to say airlink or virtual desktop can't work for others"
"Everything runs smoother, clearer and i dont get motion sickness with it. I can also run much better graphic settings so everything looks better."
Spot on. I feel the same way. I'll be racing in VR for a long time to come.
"Exactly my same feeling so I'm trying to understand what OP means by ""Iracing and acc looks like dog shit"" cause if we are both SO HAPPY with something like the Rift s (which is WAY WORSE in resolution) I can't understand what's happening here...

&#x200B;

Maybe they have a shit PC? (I have a 5800X3D and a 3070Ti) [https://www.3dmark.com/spy/44724126](https://www.3dmark.com/spy/44724126) so maybe indeed if the computer is worse I can see how it could be bad FPS or bad res..."
"Man I finally got my rift s setup and I'm struggling getting some footing. Lol.

Don't get me wrong it works perfectly in iracing minus crashing sometimes when trying to load but restarting steam vr and making sure the oculus vr server is closed before trying again fixes it I think.

I was kind of shocked it all just plugged in and worked. No fps dip at all. What's the easiest/minimalist way to at least maybe get better settings? Lol.

I'm in a rtx 4070 13700k and 32gb ddr5 just want to make sure I'm not missing in anything with this setup.

It's also annoying as it seems like I have to get 3 programs to work together. Oculus, steamvr, and iracing."
"How's your experience with the original Rift (not S)?

I have that and the Quest but I'm not sure which would be better"
What's the experience in Iracing? or you did just play other kind of games?
"Interesting. Someone buys a wireless-first headset, doesn’t take the time to set it up properly (once!) and complains about it not being perfect out of the box.

I did take the time to set it up and the difference between no settings VS proper setup is night and day. Love my Q3.

I admit there was a bit more of upfront configuration compared to my Rift S and G2, but the final experience is miles better than any of the older ones could deliver for me."
"I don’t play ACC anymore, but I used to use both together. I would push bitrate 850mbps, and reduce a bit the vertical fov with the Oculus Dubug Tools (I think that’s what you mean by dev tools), alongside of making use of some settings of openxr toolkit. You are not limited to one or another."
I get stable 90fps w/ most high settings in iracing .. the graphics are trash and in desperate need of modernization .  It is what it is.
Thia guy is an island boi🍟
Do you mind sharing how you set up your .ini file? I run a Quest 3 and I have performance headroom that I'm probably not fully utilizing.

literally zero competitive racers use VR
"imagine thinking what you just read mean I couldn't get mine working lol I started simracing in VR and have owned VR headsets since the DV1

you're just stupid and easily impressed by a monitor strapped to your face, if I'm not touching things in VR and interacting with the world then I'll just enjoy 4k 240hz on my monitors instead."
Being static is why it sucks lol
"Yuck lol I do both in 4k on a 240hz super ultra with mini LEDs 

Try playing roomsdale experiences in VR. Careful you might accidentally exercise lol"
You should try thrill of the fight lol
"Thanks, will give it a read and a go."
"Mixed reality support is needed for the G2, which is a big reason why I bought a quest 3 instead. It's also better in so many ways than the G2. 

Pass through doesn't work like you describe. Pass through lets you see the world through the cameras on your headset. You can't see the game at the same time.

Some games do work that way, but for now racing sims do not."
"I'm guessing you need glasses. Even -1 made a huge difference in vr clarity for me.

I don't wear glasses for anything in my daily life except for driving.

I had a very similar experience with every VR headset I tried until I got prescription inserts.

When gaming in a monitor things look sharper without my glasses so it really doesn't make any sense."
"It depends on specific games and headsets and pcs. 
Give it a try, it can’t hurt"
"It shouldn't, but maybe. OpenXR was developed to be a standard that every headset could share. So instead of having code that would only run on an Oculus, they have the same code for every headset and each manufacturer defines what that code means for their specific device.

The reason that's so powerful is that instead of a developer implementing code for every headset they only need to write it for OpenXR. In theory this makes it so every headset, including ones that don't yet exist, will work in their game.

Any gains in performance from this are a happy accident."
Unfortunately you need to check it urself. Its still early stage and only game that i use that support it is iRacing.
"id say yes, i used it on MSFS and went from unplayable to near perfect, upped a few settings for quality over a few frames and it’s amazing, some tiny tearing on high load sceneries but otherwise actually helped me get more detail"
"Foveated rendering will help important picture quality (center of screen) by reducing resolution of your peripheral vision. It gave me more quality AND more frames with a 3090 and a ryzen 7 3700X. Definitely check out the forum thread for VR settings on the iRacing forums (dont have a link, but google will help you)."
Yes I was able to up graphics some when I stepped from oculus to openXR on quest 3. See my recent post about it
"I did, probably not as much as I should have. I haven't tried iRacing with the link cable yet. I started PCVR with MSFS and spent several hours trying things to get it to run with the Link Cable. The MSFS community mostly uses VD, from what I gather most people have much better performance with it over anything else."
"So if i just select open xr in the dropdown on iracing thats it? 

How do you stop the oculus program in the background or will that run anyway? 
I'm currently using cable 3060 ti"
I will have to do that. I’ve been having to end tasks in the task manager and restart it praying it works. I want to switch away from oculus all together it pisses me off but I want a new rig first so I’m suffering
"It doesn’t, it’s complained about a lot. I also find it even more strange since the Q2 supports it."
"I also really loved the clarity of the G2 but I found I couldn’t hit it consistently enough to be happy with it because of the small sweet spot. 

And yea, ACC in VR is just not possible unless you are okay with muddy everything."
"Gotcha, I never bought it because I heard about the terrible performance and didn't want to deal with that."
"atm there isn’t really a better option than the Quest 3. 

Big Screen Beyond, Valve Index, etc are definitely contenders but wireless is the next step"
"It's not the worst idea. My BIL has a Q2, he's forever running into the problem of having the headset die partway through playing a game. The cord doesn't charge faster than the headset dies apparently.

I used to use VR way more, but I moved and my computer room is smaller now. Just something to consider before spending a ton of money on a headset. I preordered the G2 and it was like a grand at the time. I don't regret it, but I am currently annoyed that I can't use it as well as I used to lol. I'm stuck with games that don't require a ton of quick movement, or sims."
"I passed on ACC because of the performance issues, was mostly asking to see if it was a ACC related or headset related"
Yeah I would agree but without open composite it’s no contest. I’m an AC nut 🥜
This is a pretty obvious troll post if you look at his claims in his responses.
"I'm planning to upgrade to something like a meta quest 3 in a couple years, so don't tell me it's actually worse than the rift s!

What's he got going on that such a higher resolution, higher fov headset looks so much worse?"
"I don't play iRacing through steam, so for me it's just oculus VR and the oculus tray tool. 

Don't ask me why this works, but I have super sampling in Nvidia control panel set to 1.73 and super sampling in oculus tray tool set to 2.5, and then I adjust my in sim GUI scale to 150 or 200% I forget which. 

Using absurd amounts of super sampling is what's gotten me the good graphics with the high frame rates. 

I also had had a failed water cooling AIO set up go bad and I didn't know it for a little while. At one point I had so many iRacing settings turned down to get good fps. My cpu was idling at 100c and thermal throttling me in games and I just didn't know it because the whole system kept to run pretty stably. 

Since I replaced the old 1x120 AIO with a 2x120 AIO that actually works, I've been slowly cranking iRacing settings back up."
"If I can remember, between now and when the kids go to bed, I will snap a screen shot of all my settings, OTT, Nvidia drivers, and iRacing. And share them here."
The difference wiht the original rift is like night and day... (at least it was for me with the rift to rift-s change..
"Did you miss the part where I said I’ve spent hours tinkering with it? That doesn’t count the time I’ve spent reading Reddit threads, and iracing forums, and cross referencing all the suggestions. Debug tool, side quest, tool bar, oculus settings, virtual desktop settings, iracing settings, and on and on. Some people say they use air link. Other say they prefer cable link. Other say they use a dedicated router and virtual desktop. Some say they use openvr, others openxr. I can’t find a definitive setup guide. The main thread on the forums is 24 pages long with people offering their own mish-mash of settings. Is it really a one time setup? When I open the oculus debug tool, the settings are often reset to default. I’m looking forward to getting it setup. But don’t you think it should be easier? After reading this thread, I got out of bed determined to dial it in some more. Fired it up and was getting 44fps."
No. Link just sucks if you come from proper PCVR.
Man of culture
"Sure no problem:

"Simplified mate = 
VR is complex to setup and a dumb dumb can’t just turn it on."
Have a nice day 👍
"Ill admit VR isn't as crisp as screens.  however to say it isn't competitive is rubbish.  I and many other people are racing in VR, competitively and having no issue.  If you can't get yours working then its a skill or patience issue."
Your doing something wrong if this is your answer lol I also have used 4k but in vr with the right settings etc it's also crisp as and can't see pixels at all image is sharp and runs smooth not our fault you don't know what your doing lol
Do you own a Rift S or something?
So you haven’t tried VR for some years I take it?
"What on earth does have have to do with anything… lol 

I’ve seen pros win on logitech G29s but that doesnt mean that a direct drive wheel is a bas purchase"
"i mean.. there is at least one who is faster than you. Or someone faster than you could easily practice for a day and beat you while they use vr.

It's really not something that impacts competitive play. If anything, way more comfortable to be looking into corners with proper depth perception"
I guess you have raced with everyone. Have a nice day 👍
So you usually run around in VR? Must be nice to have an Olympic Stadium for a house.
"Ive been playing vr roomscale games for over 3 years, way before I started simming. I’m quite aware of how it is."
How do you swap back and forth?
Gotcha thanks! Just need new hardware then 😭
"If they have to port OpenXR code to the Oculus code, I wouldn't call it a ""happy accident."" It would depend greatly on how much effort the studio puts into the port."
How did you change the API that MSFS uses? I can't find an option anywhere.
I'll give it a try
"Yup I got vrperfkit set up. My hardware sucks though. 

Ryzen9 3900XT

RADEON 5600XT"
"If you have some recommendations on what I can turn up, I'll be willing to try. I really did have to take every option to the basement, but it looks like I have some overhead with my CPU to enable some things. Here's a pastebin of my log I ran of doing a practice session with 10 or so people. I opened in megalogviewer, but you can use any csv viewer. GPU seems to get up to 62% but CPU seems to peak at 30%

https://pastebin.com/jFBSCq4y"
"FWIW, I only use VD wireless, and pretty much always have. I used the cable a bit at the start before I got a good router, but being wireless is far better, even if visual performance is on par, which I think my cable was worse with things like elite dangerous. Being able to have my race rig away from my computer is great, I can be plugged into a proper QC charger and not run out of headset battery after a while and generally it's just easier to open VD, hit connect and then start game. Oculus always needed extra menus then getting it working was harder too."
I'd love the big screen beyond but too much money. I wish the Q3 had a display port connection. 
"Ah yeah my bad then, thanks for the correction.

Super weird indeed"
"It's funny because I really haven't noticed the ""small sweet spot"" everyone talks about. Either I have it phenomenally adjusted or the sweet spot is just better suited for my head shape"
"Oh yeah, they still haven’t fixed that on the Q3. It’s easily the most frustrating thing, my internet isn’t *quite* good enough to use the AirLink, but I’m still tethered to my PC AND it won’t charge?"
"Which is a bummer, if I could get ACC sounds in to iracing I’d be a happy man."
"open composite does nothing to the graphics, the picture is the same mate. it might give more fps but it still looks as bad."
"That's what I'm trying to figure out, cause in my head it doesn't make sense that something with more res, and better pixel density looks worse.."
Yeah I have standalone iracing too but steamvr opens no matter which option I pick when launching a race. Whether openxr or openvr.
"🙏

I'm also new to VR and modern hardware lol. Back in the day we just had some really basic stuff and used in game settings for 99% of it.

My old old pc was from 2010 with a 2015 GPU lol."
I agree with this. The rift to the rift s was a night and day change. I wasn’t in sim racing until late into rift s owning so i can’t compare to that extent
"That sound like capping, as your rig / settings can’t hit 90fps, so it halves the fps. Download oculus tray tool, it holds the settings. Try bitrate 200-300mbps over cable or airlink and work up from there.

Wifi 6 router is a must IMO, on Wifi 5 I’d go 200-250mbps max. Also try H.264 encoder, dynamic bitrate off or if you have a 4080+ card, use Virtualdesktop with AV1. Both of those options work on my 4080, previously used H264 on 3080"
"Before tuning? Yes.

After tuning? On par (for me)."

"He said that it's competitive, I didn't just make the claim outta no where

Pros can use bad hardware, but not VR."
Being faster than me isn't what I was talking about lol
"yes literally every single person on the planet lol thats what I need to do to tell you that zero high level iracers play in VR

only people who are bad are faster in VR"
"Garage, living room and bedroom all have more than enough space for room scale VR lol you don't need an Olympic stadium"
Super easy. Just double tap the side of your head. It's seamless.
I recently found out about that and it looks cool. I would’ve thought it would have been more than $1k though
"Yea man thats one thing that is always a variable in VR and what might work for you won’t for others and vice versa. I’d argue it’s one of the bigger barriers of entry for this hobby, just finding something that fits and works comfortably."
"Yeah def a downside. Sweet for shorter sessions though, pure freedom"
"I don’t think you set yours up correctly, changed everything for me. I followed this https://youtu.be/TVqW-DJsivc?si=GVMToWPmvV0di8k9"
" I have CV1, quest 2, quest 3.  Each one is a big leap over the previuos. Only one ive never used is the S.  Its lesser than the q2 from what i know about it."
"I run it through oculus rather than open xr or open VR. I was running it through open XR with a configuration tool, but I just found better success using the oculus sim option and setting up oculus tray tool."
My just previous PC was a 3rd Gen i7 with 16 GB of DDR3 and and I don't even remember the graphics card but it was a GTX something. Running windows off of a physical hard disk.

These are my current settings and a screen shot to show what it looks like. get a stable 80FPS even during the start with everyone on screen at once."
"I’ve had it running 90fps with previous configurations. I gotta figure out which of the settings I need to reconfigure. 3080ti, 7800x3d, fast ram."
"Nah.  There's no guide or tuning that overcomes it.

I couldn’t agree more :) mate
"Bro woke up and chose violence, haha."
"lmao, tell that to my first place league trophy and my second place team trophy from late last year... clearly not competitive at all!"
"Ah, so you set everything up wrong, got mad and now you hate VR?"
"Pretty wild statement to say Pros can’t use VR. No way to argue how many of them have even  tried it 🤣🤣 Any change of hardware is avoided at a pro level. You’ll see FPS players in 4:3 just because their muscle memory is used to it.

Someone I race with daily hit and maintained 6k on Vr. He changed to triples a month ago for ease of use reasons. He hasn’t gotten faster or slower because of the visual change didn’t matter."
competitive csgo players play at 800x600 resolution. That doesn't mean modern resolutions are less competitive. It's simply a tangential factor that pros aren't used to
👍
"You'll never be able to do what you'd do in real life (read ""walk""). So you're always static, the only difference: you're supposed to be static in a car."
It adds up once you get the required valve index base stations for outside in tracking.
"Yes, it still subpar to iRacing, AC and AMS2

Just watched that video, settings about the same but you can see how non-smooth it runs just in the video alone"
"Cool! Thanks for the info!! If this is right then probably moving to the Q3 could be huge for me 🤞🏻🤞🏻

Out of curiosity, how many fps u get with the Q3 and what’s your computer?"
"Thanks! ill play aorund with that and it gives me an idea of what to look for.

I've never messed with oculus tools or anything.

How does rudskogan work for you? That's the only track the out of the box settings drop in GPS I've found so far."
"There is. Trust me, I’ve tried (with success)."

"I heavily disagree. And don't get me wrong, I own a quest, so I am familiar with room scale VR, but you'll NEVER walk around care free, there will ALWAYS be a wall within 3 to 4 steps."
Ok cool. I'll play with my settings to match yours more. Apparently a lot of people have issues with fps on that track.
"I sold my G2 once getting a Quest 3 due to the quest 3 being a better experience (Mainly due to the lenses) than the G2 in iracing.

&#x200B;

Also never having to use WMR software which is just abandon ware no has been great.

&#x200B;

They are on par with each other now with my PC at least."

I plan on doing a full multi class race there tonight. If I remember I'll provide an update after that.
"Having to launch Link in the headset before launching the sim automatically makes it an awful experience for me.  Never mind the unreliability of Link.  Having a black screen due to Oculus encoder crashing mid Schumacher-S during a broadcasted official was the last straw for me, and wasn't the first time it happened.

It's very freeing to be able to just launch iRacing, go grab a drink and sit down and just drive.

I don't give WMR software a single thought.  It launches automatically when needed and just sits there otherwise.  If anything, any updates to it would make it worse.

And having had a Quest 2 before, there's absolutely no amount of visual improvements that would make me go back to a non-native PCVR headset.  G2 looks good enough (and I can make it look even better with GPU upgrades) and Link was just non stop issues. 

At this point as well, Link is also abandonware.  It exists for developers to develop Quest software so they don't need to constantly redeploy APKs to the device.  It's why features like Eyetracking and handtracking which could just be exposed as OpenXR features are locked behind a developer flag.   

Additionally, in the last 2~ years, Oculus has managed to push updates that completely break PCVR to the release build.  Issues that would have been caught if someone spent exactly 5 seconds trying to launch Link during QA.  It's so low priority that it's not even part of their QA processes."
"Badass, man. I seriously appreciate this. I'll compare my file to this when I get on later."
"Explain please because I'd love to know how you walk around in VR without headbutting a wall.

(I know about setting up virtual walls, my point is that your space will never be big enough)"
"Low horsepower races often give you the most exciting racing. The '34s are super grippy cars. Very race-y. Same with the oval street stocks. The grip levels are so high and the horsepower so low, there's no real gap from managing anything. Everybody just goes lol."
When I'm in a funk with road racing I go straight into dirt road. Driving the big ol tank trucks is just so much fun for me. Im not really focused on hitting an apex the right way. I'm focusing on how much speed can I jump this hump into another Truck and pass him in the corner.
I wish they would do more Legends car road races. Or even a road series. Would've made more sense prior to the Vee/1600 but regardless.
"Vee and Street Stock for me! I agree as well, less work and much more fun than the faster classes."
"Shame they rarely go to road tracks, best fun I've ever had with iracing was drifting them around Oulton Park with a mate.

&#x200B;

Even had the pleasure of pulling them out of tyre barriers at Croft Circuit last year (I hope they tour with the BTCC Again!)"
Try out the Spec Ford for some slower but very tight racing.
"It is phenomenal racing on the service and it is phenomenal racing in real life. If you have any kind of short track culture near you, go check out some Legends racing! It’s a blast!"
I would love a larger d class open setup formula vee series myself. Luckily I’ve found a league but the low hp cars make some amazing racing and reminds me of my karting days so I always come back.
"Absolutely agree!
Just want to add that I’ve added this mod to Assetto Corsa and had ton of fun racing canyons or other touge with AI. This cars looks so stylish outside the track! I’ve imagined I were there in the mountains and it was just amazing feeling to ride among 20 other ‘34s"
the only car I can circle track race in at all.
"Yeah, both the legends and rookie ovals are great."
"See even street stock is ""a lot"" for me as I haven't really done it that much, which after playing this game I have a ton more respect for oval in general."
">Same with the oval street stocks

Me spinning out in the pits has entered the chat"
"Dude how do you even steer the trucks lol! Going from F4 to the truck is the weirdest feeling, but your right it's a blast when you're in a funk and need a break."
"It's hard to go back to the Vee or 1600 after driving F4 for the most part. I forget there is no aero and usually bomb way to fast into corners, plus the sliding around just makes me so nervous."
"Advanced legends are at Lime Rock this week, it's amazing."
Those beasts are all throttle turned
"The sliding is what makes it so fun lol.

Just whipping the 1600 through corners with tires screaming."
It’s crazy that the F4 is so much easier to drive than the Vee lol. Same with the GT3/GT4 cars and the MX5. Every time I feel like jumping into a rookie road race for fun I turn into Nikita Mazepin
"I really really need to get my oval license up, for this series specs lol"
Yeah that's what I'm learning after about 20 laps thats I just did. I'm probably going to stick with dirt oval as I'm finally figuring out unwinding the drift. So much more wheel work then road lol. Feels like my wheels is gonna come off my desk with how much I'm using it in these tracks.
"Yeah it just takes me awhile to get used to it, which makes me want to join less races because I'm scared in gonna fuck it up for someone lol I'll get over it, and irl it would be a blast! It's just game specific for me idk"
"Weird parents, huh?"
"It's either a huge coincidence or 72FPS is expected, as I and many videos/guides for Quest 3 and iRacing settle on 71-72FPS, seemingly regardless of resolution, refresh rate, graphics settings etc. (i9 with 3080).

VR has transformed how I use iRacing, previously on a 43"" Samsung I could only see my mirrors (open wheel) but nothing really beside me, relying on CrewChief or mapped buttons for blind spots. Now I can see everything more naturally, it feels faster and more precise.

Interface-wise, previously I would have many widgets open from RaceLabApps, now I have only the standard iRacing relative black box, partly because I couldn't get RaceLabApps to work, but mostly I don't need them. It's transformed iRacing for me from feeling like  I'm participating in some race strategy game where I'm studying the stats and panels for relative times, fuel calculators, lap timing, now it's raw racing, head down and focus.

Graphically it's a slight step down compared to a good monitor(s) but offset that with the immersion. Quest 3 is great value if you don't have the ability to go triples but want to see/experience more than a single monitor!"
"After a few hours of adjustments I was able to run 90fps at 1.3 graphical setting with a quite a few visuals in iRacing graphical at summit. Rudskogen took 1.2 at 90fps and most of the visual eye candy turned off though. 
Still a massive improvement from the oculus launcher though"

Going to the series it shows no timr trials for this series. What you can do thought is if you get to above 4.0 you can do mpr in the b class series. Also road is mostly less than 10laps in tts
"Ah okey, I'm at work at the moment and thought of this so I couldn't go to the client and check it out. I forgot that you could do the series with C class at >4.0 SR. Thanks for reminding me."
"Something very similar used to exist with simracingstats but is no longer functional. I would like another website like the one you described though. I’m sure it would get plenty of traffic. 

For your first problem, could you pull the track temps from each session and then average those? So you get average times on average track temp"
I usually just go to https://iracingdata.com/
I am always wondering what is a time that my irating range should be aiming for at a new track.
"You’re in luck, a hero (not me) stepped up to replace it:

https://www.iracingstats.net/"
"Of course I could do something like that. Thanks for the feedback. If I release the app, I will add information about the average track temp"
Thank you for sharing. I used to rely on simracingstats.com but it went down long ago. I'm glad to see the expected times by IR.
Super great!!! Saves me...
"Data doesn't look right. I am a 1800 irating driver and I ran a 1:21:1 last night in quali (which would have placed me top split, 5 tenths faster than anyone else in my SOF). The fastest time on that graph is like 1:21:6 for my irating?  
Do they remove outliers?"
It doesn't clear until you leave pitlane. So it wouldn't have cleared
"I had a black flag for entering a closed pit while I had to serve my meatball flag. I ended the race with it and I was still fine.

At Talladega the line is after the pit exit so you could have served it and finished the race with it cleared. Although, I do believe you have 2 laps to serve the black flag once it is displayed. You would be fine either way"
That’s what I kind of figured. So either way I was screwed. Thanks
"I ended up finishing the race 19th, but my race labs showed 5th at the end of the race and then dropped me all the way down."
"Interesting. I haven’t gotten a black flag for incidents before but that is good to know.

I suppose had you served the penalty on the last lap you wouldn’t have been relegated that far down. I wouldn’t have guessed that would have happened."
Man I bet he was angry when he missed
"I love racing with children. Squeezes you until he pit maneuvers himself. Then tries to take you out and fails. 

Rule #1 in intentional wrecking: if you're going to get protested at least hit the other car.

Had a week 13 race where they had gt3 cars at Phoenix oval. Same thing. He pit maneuvered himself on me. He came out of pits and tried to bait me into passing him over comms. Finally went for a gap because he was basically stopping on track.  He tried to hit me and instead put himself into the wall (again)."
Please file a protest
hahaha he tries to push you off track and fails - tries to INT you later and fails even harder. I just know he was punching his rim hahaha
"I had this happen to me a few weeks ago.  The other driver pushed me off the track, causing bent steering on my car.  He threatened me over comms, and tried to punt me in the last corner.  I filed a protest, and I’m pretty sure he was banned for a few days.  I made sure that I submitted a screenshot of his threats to retaliate."
i appreciate you showing both drivers' view of the initial incident.
Nice awareness man. I love it when someone avoids an intentional ram like this. Poetic.
"As someone just starting to get into sim racing, I hope the number of troll driver videos on here are the outliers and not the norm"
I’ve been a couple of (rookie) races like this where people just pit maneuver and torpedo on corners rather than race fair. It’s sucks.
"Blatantly intentional wrecks seem so dumb. 

Not only does it show a tremendous lack of emotional maturity but it’s damn risky if you care at all about your future on iRacing. If it doesn’t lead to a ban, it’ll at least lead to a notation on your account that won’t be helpful the next time someone protests you for something a bit more questionable. 

It just doesn’t make any sense. The other person potentially loses some make believe internet points; and you potentially get banned from a service you’re paying for and won’t be refunded for."
I hope you protested this
lol so he tries to squeeze you off the track and ends up crashing him self out because of being stupidly aggressive.  Than is mad at YOU for it and tries to crash you out again but fails.  Hopefully you report him and send both those clips
"The initial incident is fully your fault. Vortex of danger, you've gotta accept that people aren't gonna see you there when you stick a nose up the inside from several lengths back. Did he squeeze you? Sure. Still, it's on the car doing the passing to do it safely. OP's at fault for initial incident. 

However, his response of trying to snipe you on the last corner should be protested. Previous incidents are no excuse to cause future ones. This isn't Hockey."
Send a protest.
There should be a subreddit just for these
Nice job watching your mirrors lol
Maybe he came from Forza Motorsport
I recognize a seasoned Forza player when I see one.  Nice dodge sir.
"Ya know, these replays are missing such a huge portion of the truth without those rear view mirrors"
"What an absolute moron, and shit driver"
Excellent situational awareness!!
Unpopular opinion but that contact is your fault. Plenty of room for that pass even where you went.
"Ah yes, better known as being Scott Speed'ed"
"That’s a GT7 move if I ever seen one, protest please 😂"
Looks like karma did its job twice
"Great situational awareness, glad he didn't get you. I never understand why people get mad when they wreck themselves when trying to wreck someone else."
Oh i like situations like this ! Well done !
I had a good laugh watching him go off
Hopefully he’s even angrier when he gets banned
Good.
I bet he was even angrier when he tried to push OP off the track
Just happened to see him in the mirror before turning in
"in iRacing, yes. At least once you're out of rookies.

Mistakes, unforced-errors, poor judgement, poor awareness, poor driving... all there, but the trolls are few and far between thanks to safety rating and protest filing systems."
I've been playing for a month now and have not seen a single incident like this one. It's a whole different world from Forza and Gran Turismo lol
You see them on here *because* they're unusual. No-one posts videos of the hundreds of races that happen every day where everything just proceeds normally.
It's been a couple months for me and this is the first time I've seen anything like it
"They are the outliers. When they happen, people just tend to post them. I've been on iRacing for two years off and on, I think I've seen maybe 2 or 3 very clear intentional wrecking incidents.

That's not to say there aren't people racing beyond their abilities, making mistakes, or the occasional blocking, but clear trolls intentionally wrecking or ramming are pretty rare, and the reporting system does actually deal with them."
In rookies outside of top split you’ll see things like this. Once you climb out of rookies and get to around a C license this doesn’t really happen anymore. Some low rated lobbies will see it but overall this is not common. I never see stuff like this in my races. I race mostly IMSA and VRS. Occasionally PCC.
Its very rare.  I have been on iracing for 7 years and can't think of anytime I have seen someone driving like that
I think its happen to me once in over a hundred races. The person that took me out was retaliating for something someone else did. They mistook me for another car with a  similar color.
Eh I'll accept half the blame for sure. It's a dangerous spot for sure but I was on his butt for a while so he absolutely should've known I was there. Hell he may have known considering how he drives
"Nah, not fully their fault. Closer to 50/50. It wasn't a lunge in a breaking zone.  It was a kink in the road. OP was clearly behind the other driver and made a move. The front car should've been aware."
"Fully his fault? wtf

&#x200B;

Yeah vortex of danger but there is a spotter..."
You are massively misunderstanding what the vortex of danger is. It isn't a get out of jail free card for any incident with you being oblivious to the car behind. OP made his move to the inside very early and the other car 100% would have been able to see him make it in the mirrors.
Lol no. You would never be able to pass if you can't ever enter the vortex of danger. He made his move way too early to have any blame here.
"Driver was *clearly* alongside well before the corner. They left the door open, and OP took it. Even when you're squeezing,  you still have to leave room."
3 times actually. He spun off at another point while blocking and break checking me
"Yeah. Was playing last night, noticed ~16k players online. Get a few of these posts now and then, but in reality it's such a small part of the experience. 

Of those 16k, a handful might be griefers, and they get identified and called out by the community, or banned quick enough that it's not a concern for the most part."
I'd have gone for that gap... but I also would have noped out when he started drifting over. Nice job on the hilarious takeout dodge.
"Agree. This isn't vortex of danger at all. Vortex of danger is in sharper corners with one car going from outside to the apex, and one car going inside. The outside car is at such an angle that they can't see the position of the car behind after they start their turn.

In this case, leading car can see the car behind the whole time, or at least nearly the whole time"
I might not be around your irating but I can definitely put some laps in for you guys
Does anyone need a team for Daytona? Friend and I are looking for a third for BMW GTP
Hey mate add my discord prjmee
I don't think there will be a downtime for that. I've certainly not seen one announced 
"I may have misunderstood. It mentions severing connections with the legacy website.

There isn’t downtime every Tuesday is there?"
"No there isn't a downtime every tuesday.
I reckon it's just that no more launching etc of the sim from members.iracing.com"
☹️😞
"Personally i'm not bothered by it. But i also never really used the website to launch really since the ui is out, at least for the functionality that is being removed. And for me it's like it was clear that this was going to happen at some point"
I just use fov calculators. Given that is what they are for
I just plugged the info into iRacing and moved the seat and monitor height until it felt good enough. It’s not worth overthinking beyond that since it’s a purely mathematical calculation.
"I have a 49 inch ultrawide.  I use the correct FOV from the FOV calculator and move the cockpit camera to where it looks somewhat right.  For example I try to have the dash in correct proportion to my physical wheel on my rig and I try to place the left side mirror so that I turn my head about as much as I would in a real car to look at it.  Obviously it’s never going to be 1:1 perfect to a real car since because the monitor is much smaller than your entire field of vision you have sitting in an actual car.

The really important part is to get the proper FOV, and camera placement is personal preference."
"Something to try…  After setting proper FOV, I’d suggest changing P in the cam settings to a negative value to where it’s nice and flat but doesn’t cause the world to look like it’s tilting away from you. Your lollipop man is a good reference for this. Then, use X to move forward or backward until the visual plane in the monitor matches up with what would be at the plane in the physical world where your monitor is. Finally, use Z to adjust up/down a bit if necessary. 

Bear in mind that this’ll make the antenna pretty large depending on monitor distance. I personally don’t notice once I’m driving. The one thing you can’t do anything about, of course, is depth. In F3 or any other open wheeler, the front tires will always look too close unless you go with a wider FOV."
Watch some YouTube
"My FOV is correct at 58, all feels good except I dont know how to exactly get the feel in camera settings. Like where should the ingame wheel be next to my real wheel? Since ingame it's bigger because of FOV and stuff."
An FOV of 58 degrees sounds absurd. Human eyes have an FOV of 135° each
"If you can, the best in my opinion is to place the screen right behind your wheel and disable the in-game one."
I play on a 55in tv and have my FOV set to 110-120° with the horizon +1.5 so that it is looking slightly higher/above my dash and in car wheel. Seems to do the trick
It's what the sim calculated :/
Can't best I can do is 65cm from the screen and right on top of my base :/
"Post a picture of your setup, someone might have a solution. I’m 51cm from my 34” UW, sitting on top of my base, I am barely 1cm of the screen with my knuckles when turning, can get to 78-79’ of FOV like that. Had to mess around with my seating position, pedals, etc to get a good position though. But totally worth the initial hassle."
"The *best*? Hell, who knows what the criteria for comparison are?! It will be impossible to agree even only on that.

iRacing’s FFB works well for me, that’s what counts at the end of the day - it’s fine! It’s not the most entertaining, though, that’s for sure. rF2 wins in that regard, in fact most other sims are more entertaining (not necessarily useful of course, but entertaining)."
Probably not but its very good and intuitive
"IMO iRacing is not the best sim in nothing but matchmaking. I'm a very happy iRacing customer, but I acknowledge that we don't have the better graphics, sound and FFB, but that doesn't matter to make iRacing the best sim to race against people.

edit: lol, downvoting started sooner than I expected. All of you guys who downvote this comment hasn't tryed other sims. It's not even debatable that iRacing is not the best in FFB. rFactor 2 which I hate with all my heart has a very good FFB, same for AMS2, ACC and AC."
"No, I do not think it does. But it's good non the less."
"rfactor 2 has the best FFB, its better with a belt driven wheel (T300) also better with a high end DD (SC2 pro). And its not even close, the road feel is incredible, the bumps, the kerbs (iRacing literally doesn’t have any FFB over some kerbs on some tracks where it clearly should), lockups, flatspots, ABS, you can feel the load going to the fronts under braking then unloading as you release, the way it communicates weight transfer in general is just better then anything else. Some of this is for sure effects that wouldnt be there irl, or at least not as pronounced but we are talking about sim games, you need that to compensate for the lack of forces on your body.

iRacing FFB is not as bad as some people make it out to be but its way behind rf2 in this."
"Since i've got my Moza R9, i retried AC and ACC after iracing and it's another world. 

AC ffb is really trash in comparison
ACC a bit better but still so much inferior to iracing"
"For some reason iRacing is the only sim where I have my ffb settings really dialled in. Other sims just don't feel good anymore😢

using a moza r5"
"Not really. Force feedback on curbs is non-existant plus you only feel what the front tyres are doing. Also don't like the spongey FFB effect when tyres overheating

rFactor 2 has the best FFB and it's not even close."
"I do agree.  I used to rave about AMS2 FFB, especially for the HF8 and buttkicker haptics.  But this weekend I played the new endurance content quite a bit and was severely disappointed after months of iRacing.  There was so much detail lacking that I have become used to in iRacing."
"Agreed. Definitely leaps ahead of all I’ve tried. AC, ACC, AMS2, Dirt rally, PCars2, Forzas, GT6, you name it."
"Have not yet tried out AMS2, but out of all the sims I have tried iRacing has the best FFB. I have the same wheel and we get 360hz feedback too through the API that replaces direct input (I think I read that in iRacing's / Simucube's official forum confirmed by staff, would have to look it up again), and also TrueForce feels superb in iRacing.

ACC I think that creates false FFB for more things that you would feel directly through the wheel, so it feels unnatural to me.

Edit: Source to take it from there:

https://www.reddit.com/r/iRacing/s/EAJDbLWG09

Not strictly 360hz, but ends up being that at the wheel minimal/practically no latency. See the top voted comment."
I think so too. I'm not sure if my settings in acc and ac are wrong but I can't seem to feel the rear in either of those games.
Easiest to get right. Others are better but the window is much smaller and if you get it wrong it feels horrible.
RBR feels better to me
"RF2 is superior in FFB and handling model, but that's only a dtep up you'll notice on a wheel even capable of showing thag detail. With the cheap wheels, it's not such a big difference, ACC being the outlier because it adds unrealistic forces to make it feel more real, even if it isn't"
Did iR ever get an FFB update? I went from default irFFB 2-3 years ago and it was much better for me. Not sure if I should get rid of it by now.
I think the traction models are too slick. In iracing.
"Oh no, here we go…

"It lacks all vibrations which travel through the front wheels into the driveshaft. Minus the Kerbs and ABS.  Otherwise, it is pretty good."
I use my wheel software to produce feedback using game telemetry. I'll gain a second or two by not using game ffb.
"For me RF2, Raceroom and AC have better FFB than iRacing, never got ACC feeling good for me, but i dont think any is bad just because other is better"
"I have just started Iracing with the logitech DD PRO wheel, only played a couple of test runs last night after I got it all set up. 

But I agree the ffb quality is awesome , you can really feel alot of detail. 

This group is just starting to gather some following come join and see others experiences and settings with this wheel 

https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechProWheel/s/h8UOEMztj3"
I actually think that maxed out with the latest content it looks very good
I don't understand how you can say that acc and ac have better ffb than iracing
lol ACC FFB is processed to shit it doesn’t even feel real. If that’s your baseline for good FFB I can’t take anything else you say seriously😂
anyone that thinks acc is good gets downvotes.
"I’m totally agree. I haven’t missed an iRacing subscription payment since February 2009

If real cars drove like iRacing cars, nobody would have the balls to drive real race cars."
"I've been playing a lot of Assetto Corsa recently. I don't think the FFB is any better necessarily, it's just different. After playing nothing but iRacing for a year and a half, AC's FFB annoyed me because it's not like iRacing where it's just communicating the forces through the steering column, it's giving you fake information about the body roll. This is confusing because on turn in especially iRacing has much more feel. Also iRacing's FFB really does feel like the tires are connected to the road whereas AC and ACC's feel floaty. It's possible to get used to it, but it doesn't feel as intuitive as iRacing to me at least."
"I think there's a couple things going on. Firstly there's the actual FFB output. Which is pretty clean in iRacing, but really slow. David Tucker has confirmed that 60 Hz is too slow to be stable for a DD wheel. While rF2 has some high frequency noise, but is fast. 400 Hz. So in comparison it is far more stable and also has the resolution to convey bumps at a far higher speed than iRacing. 

Then there's the physics. I think iRacing and rFactor both have good physics, but they have focused in different areas. Also the core physics runs at 2,400 Hz in rF2 instead of the pseudo 360 Hz rate used by iRacing. I think iRacing is ahead in some ways and behind in others. rF2 obviously has the edge, but it's not huge these days I don't think. Though it is significant in the areas that I value. Like tyre flex, dynamic track and slick tyre feel. iRacing is catching up though."
"The kerbs are being renewed, drive a lap at Okayama or Mugello"
"ayyy i have a moza r5 and TM TLCM petals on the way to my door :D petals tomorrow, and hopefully a week or so for the wheel"
"I don’t really have this problem as I’m using the recommended settings for each game right off the Logitech site, which Logitech provides these settings on a per game basis, including a screenshot of the actual game settings. 

Why does Logitech do this? Because Logitech loves us bro. And we love them 😌"
Honestly it's probably down to the hard efforts of iRacing dev David Tucker. He's gone in and made sure damn near every wheel you can buy off the shelf has accurate data by default. 
To be fair I haven’t played RF2 on my DD setup. I bought the game like 10 years ago…wonder if I can somehow reinstall it lol. Is it still pretty popular? Is it still supported? I just don’t see anyone ever talking about it.
Yeah AMS2 doesn’t have quite the good feel of iRacing but I do like it more than ACC. AMS2 is still a fun game as far as AI racing is concerned. iRacing would be a fun game if doing it with more than 3 AI cars didn’t tank your framerate so hard. Try to setup an AI race of 22 GTE cars at Zandvoort and see what I mean. It’s pretty sad. It could be that Zandvoort is just poorly optimized. I’ve run AI races of 42 1987 stockcars at Daytona oval and I don’t remember the framerate being shit there.
"That's true, the AMS2 endurance content feels very off to what we are used in iRacing, any of the LMDH felt likely iRacing ones, I was even taking the corners in different gears than in iRacing, that felt a bit off."
"You should def try out AMS2, as someone who mainly enjoys AI racing and hotlapping, it’s great. 

And dude I feel like Trueforce is a game changer in immersion. Feeling the vibration through the wheel every time I start the engine puts a smile on my face."
RBR for sure has the best dirt physics out there. The FFB on tarmac is a little weird but it's so hard to make a single system that does both tarmac and dirt really well.
"I haven’t played RF2 in probably 10 years. I wonder if I’d be able to access my old account and download it again. Is the game still supported by the devs? 

Also, I wouldn’t call the Logitech G-Pro a cheap wheel. It’s their direct drive wheel capable of 11nm of force and the wheel/base alone is $1000. With games that support Logitech Trueforce, I’d put this wheel up against anything out there. The only game I’ve played on it that doesn’t support Trueforce is the new Forza."
"I get that vibration information through Logitech Trueforce. It also gives engine vibration, which is very immersive."
What wheel software is this?
"Don't get me wrong, iRacing looks good and the way the cars move is the most realistic out there, but IMO is a step under some sims when it comes to graphics only."
"It’s simple, they just got used to it."
I dokt understand it either. To me iRacing has much higher resolution.
"100% wrong. Your mind is telling you that because you’re used to the “processed to shit” FFB of all other sims. That’s not to say they’re bad, but they do FFB differently (and the more traditional way) by adding SOP effects in to help out the fact that the only forces you’re feeling from the car are through your steering wheel (if you don’t have a motion rig, which of course most people don’t). ACC feels as it does because it’s the only sim out there trying to feel as close to what the real GT3 cars feel like through the wheel and the wheel only.

We as gamers sit at home in a chair. We don’t experience the G’s, we don’t experience that feeling through the seat of our pants. We have a wheel with highly detailed FFB to go with, that’s it (again, outside of a full motion rig.) 

So this doesn’t suit everyone and is why ACC’s FFB is so divisive, but just had to point out that the fact it feels the way it does is the exact opposite of what you’re saying."
"It’s wild to me because I went into ACC thinking it was the best. Not realizing that many people think AC is the best, not ACC. I haven’t played AC in a long time, and not once on my DD wheel."
"yea there really is grip until there just is none out of nowhere. You have to know the limit instead of feeling it, kinda... Wish they could acquire the RF tire model."
Is it not that iracing only simulates the actual steering column of any given car whereas ACC and a few others simulate the ffb as if it were coming from the track/wheels of the car??
"Isnt 60hz effectively updating at 60 times per second. I have a hard time believing its noticeable. I suppose if you were driving at 1000mph, which would mean you are traveling many many feet per second and maybe it would matter but.. this is just based on intuition.. i have no actual knowledge on the subject."
"Pretty sure 3D kerbs were a thing in other (much cheaper) games for a very long time though, and I am not even sure that will fix these weird skips in iRacing, but time will tell. I did like a good 100-150 laps on Mugello but thats just not enough of a sample size for me. And I will also always lean towards criticism because thats what will move things forward.

iRacing has too many fanboys already who will make excuses for every problem there is, even when its legit an issue."
"I can't, they aren't optimized and run like shit"
"For sure mate, fully agree.  AMS2 is still my No.1 game for pure racing fun!  iRacing is for the slightly more serious stuff."
"RF2 has had a resurgence recently with an integrated online system, it still lacks in variety and playerbase compared to iracing, but it's a fabulous alternative for some. I'd absolutely give it a go.

And I know about the wheel, I said cheap meaning the g29 or a t150, I believe that the logitech is good, but I doubt it's anywhere as good as those from the brands who've been making DD wheels for years now"
Sim commander
"But you just said it’s the best at nothing but matchmaking, not it’s the best with car movement"
True
"I’m 100% wrong, but then you proceed to tell me 10 sentences about how it is processed to shit, but that’s it’s okay.

Even you can’t deny it lol. It’s fake effects filling the steering rack.

It feels awful, nothing like driving a real car. You don’t feel G’s through your steering rack when you’re on track the way AC/ACC tries to fake.

And yeah, it is even more awful with a motion rig.

Don’t get me started on AC having the spongiest brakes known to mankind on any sim."
No need to buy the rF model. They've literally hired some of the people fundamental to building it over the past 2 years and it does show in the newer cars how they feel at the limit 
"The tracks are just as bad. The tracks have an imaginary/invisible grip strip, if you can’t feel it or find it, you’re destined to burn up tire."
"iRacing only simulates the forces that come through the steering column and ACC adds in or takes away forces that wouldn't be normally acting on the steering column to give you more of a sense of G forces because you lack them in a sim. So it makes the steering lighter on turn-in to the simulate the body roll whereas iRacing is heavy as soon as you start to turn the steering because it's just simulating the forces from the road, through the tires and wheels, through the suspension, the steering rack and then through the column to your hands."
"Yes, at 60 mph we are only talking a foot. 2 foot at 120 mph. Vs 3 inches at that speed in rF2. So there is an argument for detail. Particularly as drivers in rFpro have noticed differences beyond 1000 Hz. Which is then less than 2mm. 

But for most of us regular chumps we notice the slow rate if we have a DD wheel. Ticks that need smoothing are fairly easily handled by firmware smoothing. But oscillations are a big problem. Instead of the wheel wanting to go straight unless you push it off center, with a DD wheel you can find yourself working just to keep it straight. The opposite of reality. David Tucker is a developer who's worked for iRacing since they were a start-up. He's confirmed that it takes more than 60 Hz to control the wheel. 

Because what happens is a bump in the road tells the wheel to go one way. Then the self aligning torque from the caster tells it to go to center again. But the wheel doesn't hear center, it hears ""go the other way"". So it does until 16.7ms later it reports back that it is now pointing the opposite way and the sim tells it to turn harder back to center. Which is now the original direction from the bump again. Rinse and repeat and it is like feedback through a microphone.

Only the delays between corrections don't actually happen every 16.7ms. Because of the smoothing we added above we are now waiting for the next frame in order to interpolate between them. So it's more like 34 ms + any processing time. The fixes are creating new problems. 

Compare that to any driving sim (the rest run at 400 Hz) and those reactions happen every 2.5ms. Or 5 ms with smoothing. Though less smoothing is needed too as we already have many more data points per second. 

iRacing are working on their FFB. But in the meantime it's silly to say they have the best when they are literally the only sim that's a decade behind all the competition. Again, I'm not talking physics here only that slow loop it runs in."
"With a proper DD you absolutely feel it. Like it was mentioned earlier, in rF2 you can get this high frequency noise but I usually turn the filtering up to get rid of it. It's sort of a rattling vibration."
100 mph is 147 feet per second.
"I’m just saying it’s already a known issue, and there’s already a fix being worked on, we just need to wait for the rest of the tracks to get it. I don’t know if other games had it first but I would have assumed so🐸"
"That’s not it, they just upped the requirements for their new tracks, the trees in both of those tracks are way more high res than before."
if you can't run iracing its about time to buy a new toaster
I just started playing it over the past weekend. I love the GT1 cars man. Driving the CLK GTR at Spa last night was truly fantastic. And that was just a practice session. Gonna do an AI race weekend this evening.
"Ok I get it, I’m in the iRacing thread. You’re an iRacing fan boy. I’ll just reiterate if you read my reply properly… I am not referring to ACC as “processed to shit”. I’m referring to every other sim as “processed to shit”. ACC is the only one that tries to replicate as much as possible what you feel through the wheel and the wheel only. All others (iRacing, ams2 etc) are “processed to shit” to compensate for the fact you don’t feel all those other forces at home on a rig."
"That's exciting to hear. I am a week and a half into being back after only really doing oval stuff back in 2018. I have no complaints - Game seems to be in a great spot and that is great news.

Having a blast in GT4. All i did before this was hot lap the nords in assetto or AMS2 so I came back and knew how to road race and learn any track after racing nords so much lol. Really really enjoying road racing."
Fair enough - i suspected i didn’t know what i didn’t know
"Yes, I consider that a problem in the rF2 FFB. But like iRacing you can dial it out in software and you're still left with heaps of detail. 

David Tucker has done some investigation and he found he is constrained by innacuracies in windows timing. Like at millisecond precision the clock can jitter between 1-2ms. So going 400 Hz can fall foul of this and introduce noise. So he's thinking they will go more like 200 or 250 Hz in iRacing. To stay above the noise floor of windows timing jitter.

That said, rFpro can run above 1000 Hz and a developer has shared a trace that showed absolutely no jitter. Less than iRacing even has at 60 Hz. Also Marcel has his Last Garage engine running at 1000 Hz and I believe that is jitter free too. The trouble is I'm sure they are not going to share how they achieved this and iRacing might never figure it out."
Thank you lol. I was like “I know you travel more than 1 foot per second at 60mph”
Sorry I meant at 60 mph you'd see about a foot between each FFB tick.
I don't agree with you
"You genuinely don’t know what you are talking about. How is IRacing “processed to shit” when it is ONLY simulating the actual feedback being received through the steering rack?

Please explain how proper steering rack simulation is “processed to shit”, meanwhile all the added simulation that ACC is doing to try and make up for lack of feeling in other areas isn’t processed. You don’t feel G’s on your body through the steering rack. That just doesn’t make sense. 

I’d love to hear the hoops you jump through. Clueless about how these games are fundamentally working it seems lmao."
"A note on the 60 Hz thing. Everything in iRacing currently runs against this 60 Hz rate. The physics actually has granularity at 360 Hz. But that can't be accessed at realtime. Effectively every 16.7 ms it runs through a loop and will calculate 6 points of physics data. Then the latest one is taken for the FFB. 

They've tried in the past to run the outer loop more quickly, but it wasn't feasible as EVERYTHING (audio, network, physics, FFB, graphics etc) runs on it. Processors just couldn't handle it. But they've recently announced that since expanding the team (including hiring Terence Groening from rFactor and rFpro) they are now working on better multithreading. Which should open up some performance headroom on the CPU. And they are also working on increasing the physics rate. Likely linked to the multithreading. 

Which means they can also increase the FFB rate. Because though we have 360 Hz physics now, it's really pseudo 360 Hz. In that we have 360 datapoints per second, but they are only calculated 60 times per second. But the thought that has gone into how to use this extra performance looks to be very well considered. It's likely we might get a wheel that is maybe not as detailed as rF2 or ACC, but without the high frequency noise. And more importantly it will no longer oscillate so easily."
iRacing has probably peaked in terms of what they can do with their engine. The weather system will be impressive but I hope they are constantly modernizing their code to catch up with the others.
"yeah, at 60hz, going 100mph, you would get an update every 2.45ft, which seems to compute to about a 16ms delay from when you hit a bump with a car, until it is reproduced on the wheel - of course this is  without adding in all the additional overhead.

Seems to make sense... in iracing, it SEEMS like when im going 100mph and hit a bump, i feel it immediately. In reality, i probably feeling it 4 feet later, but my brain is none the wiser."
1.47 feet.
"There’s going to be a graphics overhaul sooner than later now, time to upgrade your rig mate. I’m now running 4k @60fps with full graphics settings on a RTX 2080 and I’m even considering to upgrade my GPU"
"Holy fucking shit, how many times do I have to explain to you!? When I’m referring to a sim that simulates the steering rack feel and nothing else, I am referring to ACC! Contrary to your original comment that iRacing is the purest FFB and ACC is processed to shit, it is the complete opposite!

Each one has its merits and I enjoy both. I get why some don’t like ACC’s FFB and find it lacking detail, but that’s because it doesn’t have all this “processed shit” on top. I’d personally never call it “processed shit” as I enjoy iRacing too, just quoting yourself and your description of it."
"Yes, but they look to be taking things apart and breaking through these limits now. I also hope they continue modernising. Some people on the forums seem to wish there were no other sims. But without competition I feel like iRacing would be crap compared to what we have now. Then we'd have a single sim and it would be lacklustre. iRacing's future plans look pretty exciting at the moment though."
Ohhh I see what you mean now. My bad.
It's not just delay in when you feel the bump. It's whether you can even feel it in the first place. Bumps can be shorter than 3 feet long. This will also come into play as we see more 3D kerbs. It might feel a bit off compared to the fake ones in places because the length of the sawtooth profiles can be less than the length between FFB ticks.
[removed]
"How many times do I need to tell you, you are wrong. Fundamentally, you don’t understand what you are talking about.

IRacing stimulates the steering rack. ACC stimulates additional forces including the G forces a driver would feel in a real car."
Agreed.
"I cant say im an expert but im not sure thats 100% accurate. If that were the case, and there was a 2ft long bump on the track, some laps you would likely feel it, and some you wouldnt.. simply depending on where you are in the ffb oscillation. Maybe one lap it happens to pole right before the bump and you wouldnt feel it. But this doesnt seem to be the case. Some tracks have small bumps, likely several feet and i can feel them in the same spot, consistently, lap after lap.

Asked GPT and it came up with: 

""If the bumps in the track on iRacing feel consistent, there are a few possible explanations:

Bump Size Larger Than Update Interval: As you suggested, it's possible that the bumps on the tracks in iRacing are designed to be longer than the distance the car travels between force feedback updates. This would ensure that no matter when the system polls for data, part of the bump is always included within the polling interval, allowing it to be consistently felt.

Track Design Consistency: Most racing tracks, even in simulations, are designed with realism in mind. It's uncommon for real-world tracks to have very sharp, short bumps that are less than 2.5 feet in length. Therefore, the design of tracks in iRacing might inherently avoid features that are too short for the FFB system to consistently detect.""

It likely since they designed the FFB system, they understand this short coming and would account for it."
You want to buy it? I’m sure my moms boyfriend wouldn’t mind If I took it and gave it to you
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
"Yeah also the suspension does take more than 17 ms to settle after a bump. So you do get some of it regardless of where it falls. I disagree with the consistency thing though. I've been practicing Daytona a fair bit ahead of the 24 on the weekend. Then last week I did some rF2 online races there in the BMW M4 Class 1. I was hitting this bump at the exit of T1 every time and thinking ""wait, I never knew there was a bump here"". Next time I was in iRacing I did notice it more or less some laps and not at all others. But even when felt, it was muted in comparison.

They designed the FFB system a long way back as an improvement to the NR2003 FFB. Since then we're seeing DD wheels which can react extremely quickly. For a long time they were adamant 60 Hz is all you need, but they seem to have come around and are now looking into raising the rate."
Pretty sure the discounts on steam are only for new accounts
"No. 

Only new accounts are eligible for the Steam discount. Existing accounts are not eligible."
idk it seems like you are wrong
"It used to be that if you had originally signed up with iRacing.com and just got a steam key, that your first purchase on steam would be considered 'new' even tho you weren't new to iRacing (it would overwrite any remaining iRacing.com subscription length tho, so worth doing at the end of subscription term). You could then sign in to iRacing using your steam credentials and it would update your iRacing.com subscription to match. You could then remove iRacing from your steam library and when your subscription ended you'd be eligible for new pricing sales again, but I'm not sure if it still works that way."
"Lol. Go ahead, waste your money. This has been covered thoroughly."
Are you guys still searching for
Me and my teammate would be keen but we drive the Porsche GT3
What’s the average lap time you guys are looking for?
Would love to join. Been paying on and off for a couple of years. Never done endurance but always wanted to. Let me know if u still have any spots I'm also EST
"Yep, I can DM you a server link if you like, we are keeping this all pretty casual"
"Well, let us know if anything changes, though I'm not sure how that would be 😅.  Good luck regardless!"
"Not really an expected lap time, just consistency , we've currently got 4 people and a very wide range of IR."
write me on discord :drakkarleon
"Go to iracing forums, lots of guys like searching for teammates, or teams recruiting."
"Hey, send me a DM, we have guys running Daytona and we are planning to do every enduro this year"
"I'd recommend adding some more details about you. What's your irating? (I'd describe a 2k person as ""average"", some people say 4 or 5k is ""average"", the true average is just over 1.3k)
Where are you from? What class/car are you hoping to race?"
"https://discord.com/invite/43CTtvKj
Come join us. Endurance racing for all levels."
Sent you a DM .
"I wonder where those inflated ""average"" numbers come from. Makes me laugh, but it's not unique to iRacing. I've seen it in every ""game"" that uses some sort of competition with a ranking system. The higher people are ranted, often the higher they think the average is."
"Ohh yess. Well 
Ir: 1360
SR: 3.05
License class : B

I am from India.

I would like to race mostly on gt3 and gtp.
I use Ferrari 296 and cadillac GTP."
"The average of active players will always be higher than the ""true"" average, simply because how many people will get their irating higher, then quit? Most of the quitters will be those who don't get on with the game, which means a lower irating. They will add their irating to the true average but won't be included in the average of active players, which is far more representative in this scenario.

I agree that 5k or 6k is high, but I'd suggest that the average of active players is around 2k."
"If you take a look at [this distribution](https://iracingreports.com/stats/23s4-Road.html#irating_chart) from Last season You'll see that There were \~116k unique drivers on iRacing. Even if you totally get rid of people who are in the Rookie Division (26.9k), meaning everyone essentially in their first season (and where most of the quitters are likely to be), you still have 89k drivers. There are 14962 drivers above 2000ir. this leaves  \~74k drivers below 2k. You have \~38.4k drivers above 15k, which is just below half of our 89k drivers. That means the median (exact middle IR) is still under 1500. 

Someone well versed in stats would likely tear apart my chose of analyzing the data, but I think it still paints a picture that the average active player is still likely lower than 1500, even accounting for a higher ""true average."""
How many hateful DMs are you sending so that you don't even remember which hateful DM it was?
Only messages you should be sending to people is positive. Dont waste your energy on angry messages
"If you can’t remember what you DM’d to people who you’ve had incidents with, you should probably just stop DM’ing people"
"If you were protested for DM'ing, and you can't remember *which* DM it was, you probably need to stop DM'ing people entirely and just race. People mess up, and you berating someone just makes them feel worse."
"Respond to the email and ask for the messages, they’d have to be included for the protest to be upheld."
I’m sitting here not knowing how to even check my DM’s 😂
Any chance you ran IMSA last night in a green/yellow Porsche GT3?
So you're prodding for the limits of an acceptable abuse level toward other drivers? Just don't be a jerk or harass other people and you wont be protested for it. It's truly that simple.
[removed]
Protest system is terrible. Always has been. How can you learn from your mistake if they don't show you the mistake?
"Good question.
I can't believe people still do this?! The race itself can already be toxic enough. Must be a very good reason. But you can't remember."
"Not many, that was the only person I did hateful DMs with.  I do friendly DMs a lot tho."
"Well I DM a fair bit in fits and spurts, sometimes I recognize names before a race and say hi nice to see you again.  Sometimes I tell the people I'm starting around that I plan to take it easy the first lap.  As far as DMs after an incident, sometimes we have a constructive discussion and they say ""yeah sorry"" and I say please try to be more careful in the future.  Sometimes people drive like there aren't real human beings behind all the other cars and I reach out to express my displeasure.  Though that's rarely the goal of DMing."
This actually worked!  Thank you.
They won’t send them back
Unfortunately they don’t care.
The messages that show up in text chat in blue are private just to you.
Bold of you to assume a protest would be resolved so quickly!  Nope this was a PROTO/GT Race on Sunday.
"You're putting words in my mouth.  I have not, and do not seek to abuse people.  I'm looking at the limits of expressing my displeasure appropriately (which, yeah, I get it, don't do that)."
![gif](giphy|krhW9yWEI0x0Y)
Your post was removed because it breaks the rules by being rude vulgar or toxic.
So the protest was warranted.
">Also I have no problem making someone feel worse if they ruined my race. 

This is the problem, and it is against the sporting code."
">  Sometimes I tell the people I'm starting around that I plan to take it easy the first lap 

Oh, so you're the guy causing incidents at T1."
"No problem, I had been protest against before for intentional wrecking (it wasn’t upheld), but since I called the other driver a bitch for brake checking me in the pit lane, after a netcode crash, they gave me a ban of two week for voice communication, they were very understanding and said that the other driver had a small citation for his actions as they weren’t sportsmanship like. There was some back and forward about it, I knew it was the correct thing not being an intentional wrecking (the other car parked right before the cones in the pit entry instead of going to his pit stall when I was right behind him with damage), but they would not let a bad word slide either in the open voice chat where it is expected some standards."
"Well, I ask because I protested someone late last night for verbally harassing me in chat after he self-spun and blamed me. It was resolved when I woke up this morning.

Edit: Just double checked. I got the confirmation email at 3:22am, and the resolution email at 7:31am."
I highly doubt that the protest was apprived over a friendly exchange.
"It was 100% warranted of course, no one is arguing that, I don't understand if you think you just did a gotcha or what."
This is a good point.  Thank you.
Also who tf looks at dms between the grid option and race start? Idk how people type during races 😂
"Well there were a lot of people going HAM on the first lap of a 30 minute race which took me out multiple races in a row.  I prefer to drive to my pace and see how the race plays out.  I've also been around long enough to know that the people who say something like ""hey everyone let's hope for a clean race, no dive bombing on t1 OK"" are the ones to watch out for.  This is why I chose to message two individuals privately."
"Thanks for the context, man.  One thing I noticed is that lots of the dangerous drivers are quick to protest you if you react to their dangerous driving.  Like they are really good at using the system and turning it against you if you react.   We all know people in real life who do something out of pocket, and when someone reacts negatively, they play the victim.  This behavior is everywhere, even iRacing.

It's a really interesting social experiment and I find it's not only a test of driving skill, but a test of staying calm (which I also fail, obviously this whole post is testament to that).

Either way thanks for the idea.  A nice oasis of good advice in this sea of negativity.  See  you on track!"
"Yep, I’ve had a “Driver notified of outcome” response within 15 minutes of filing a protest before. They do a great job when not overloaded."
Well first of all this report was for text chat.  Second of all I wait until after I watch the replay to call people out.  :)
Wow did you figure that out all on your own?  Of course.
"Well I mean, if it’s warranted then why this silly post?"
Yeah for a while there they were on top of it.  It's back to 2-3 days again now unfortunately.
I did put words in your mouth but what other practical purpose does it serve to know precisely what you said deserved the warning? You knew the race and you knew you got successfully reported for your bad conduct. The only practical purpose to knowing specifically what made it a successful protest is figuring out where the line is.
"So why are you bitching on reddit about protesting? You obviously know you did something wrong, so own up to it."
Because I don't remember what I typed in a race two days ago.
I don't deny anything you said. In the message to which I'm replying here.
I don't understand how you're conflating what I said with not owning up to it?  If you reread the post maybe you'll understand better?
Then I didn't put words in your mouth. I said your quiet part out loud.
I’m not conflating anything. Your messages are saved. Go read and reflect on your life.
"It's not quiet.  I'll type it here for the world to see: I wanted to know where the line is!  I wanted to know what I can say and how I can say it when I'm displeased with the behavior of others in iRacing.  And you DID put words in my mouth.  You used the word ""abuse,"" which does not apply in this case.  I don't abuse people."
Bro you are too funny.  I've gotten closure.  How about yourself?
You're clearly abusing people if you're trying to find the limit of precisely how shitty you can treat someone without it resulting in a successful protest.
"Hey man, whatever is inside you that is automatically assuming the worst, I hope you explore that and get better."
What car do you drive?
I mostly Lamborghini but I'm open to any car.
We're going to be doing either the Saturday 1200 GMT or 1600 GMT race (probably the former). If you're interested dm me.
Dm me
If you’d like to join a team of 4 send me a DM
Also looking. A license. Lots of experience. Please DM if anyone has a seat
"That was nice. Not gon’ lie tho, I’m more jealous of the considerate, etiquette following other driver you battle’d with. lol. 

Almost every guy I passed at seca this past weekend absolutely infuriated them, & drives like every line on the track is theirs by blood. Or just goes full road rage & punts me from behind @ the next brake spot. 🤣"
Nice squeeze.
"Great pass! And props to the other guy aswell for taking it like a champ, these battles are the reason I have the 20 pieces perma-discount"
"Nice!  
So many bad attempts there this week (Forza style passing...)"
"Semi-related question - how do you get the text window at the bottom right to show incident counts on replays? Like at the start of your video where it pops up with the 0x for the slight contact?

I've seen this on a few videos but have never been able to work it out myself. My text window always just holds on to the text data from when it appeared live during the race."
"Seca is a dangerous track though. Even more if driving side by side. I just hopped back to the service, I've driven the Simlab production challenge and now the advanced mx-5 cup. Racing in both series has been elegant and enjoyable."
Many thanks!
I have no idea. This was a saved replay though. Maybe they don't show just after race has ended?
"Ahh yeah, maybe it's just enabled like that for saved replays. Thanks."
"BMW's fault obviously, but it looks like if you weren't there, he would have still made the corner. He shouldn't be able to catch you anywhere near that much in that turn."
"In his defense, you were going insanely slow through that corner.  Probably caught him off guard."
Its a practice session these things happen
"&#x200B;

"I guess my original comment didn't get posted. 

The guy who hit me was former IndyCar driver Oriol Servia.  That was the reason I put this up."
"Ahh ok, i guess he wasn’t expecting you to be slow, he can probably carry a lot more speed around the corner"
"make sense- hes expecting perfection. You definitely took that corner mad slow, but you are not an indycar driver lmaoo"
Yeah this was my advice for someone wanting to learn how to drive I mentioned this feature and said drive along with them to practice corners and when and when not to try and overtake instead of dive bombing lol
"Well now, how does this work? Are you in ghost mode, can you even be seen by the drivers actually in the race? I assume you can't collide with anyone."
Hold on … how do you do this?? That’s awesome
I wonder if we were in the same F4 race lol. Tsukuba with 22 F4 cars is fucking insane. I hate that it’s the car that I’m the quickest in because it’s a given that half the grid can’t keep the car on the track.
I haven't found the test drive during a race very helpful.  First you can't take the gride with the rest of the cars so you come out of the pits already behind.  Also because your not really racing the other driver's have no idea you are there and it's not so much a issue because your a ghost car. It can be very hard to see through the cars as you are trying to drive
Wait this is awesome

Racing in *the spirit world*! Almost as good a crossover of racing sims and RPGs as using chronomancy magic to win races in forza
I have been using this to learn from top split before my own race for a while. great feature honestly.
Only 2 weeks? Pretty sure I went about a year before someone told me about that FML 😂
[deleted]
Wild! I had no idea! Haha
this is gonna help me practice B class road on new tracks without the line
"I found out by loading a race just to watch top split once. Noticed the drive button, hit it and it obviously loaded me in. Thought it was like a bug or something and panicked and exited thinking I was gonna fuck someone's race."
"I wish you could test drive while part of a multiclass race instead of having to back out. For my first Daytona 24 last year, I joined and had no issue practicing before the race. First stint was later approaching, so I backed out to warm up in a test session with no issue. Rejoined, got in the car, and pulled out of the pits to realize I didn't have FFB. Managed to survive the stint thankfully with only one spin exiting back out into NASCAR T1 from the infield."
Dude.. No.. way.. I gotta try this..  This sounds like I’d be amazing for practicing..
No one sees you. You're not on track with them. They ghost through you from your perspective.
"It’s a normal test drive but every people in the race is a ghost, they can’t see you, you pass through them. 

Pretty cool if you’re not confident with a car/track combo yet and want to learn a bit from the guys in top splits"
You're a ghost but you still get a tow and dirty air as if you were there.
"Register for a race that's already started, once it loads click Test Drive on the top like you normally would. It's amazing."
"Watch a race, you'll see you can drive up top after the actual race starts"
"Go to the registration page after the race has started, you will see all the splits with WATCH beside it. Click watch, and then enter your car. Also, the LOWEST number is top split."
"Yeah I practiced for hours both alone and in AI races before jumping into a race. Luckily I managed to only spin it once, but I was fucking pooped after the race"
I'm sure there is someth8ng else I'm unfamiliar with lol
Uhhhh what's that now?
I’ve been playing for a little over a week or some.. so yeah learning features like this is awesome.. go easy on me in the comments please.. I’m just a new guy.. I keep it safe at least as well.. already B class.
"Can’t wait to try that out tomorrow, thank you!"
"I’m definitely going to run some AI races each week until I’m comfortable. My SR got really screwed up last night because of it lol. My main issue was people braking way too early and me inevitably eating shit, which is my fault for sure"
I'm sure I'm in that same boat 😂
"here mate :)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEshzTvMQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEshzTvMQ4)"
Yeah I'm probably one of those folks braking too early. I'm still bad at trail braking so I have to take a lit of the hairpins as late apex to make the corner in any sense of speed.
Thats the active reset he is talking about in his opening post?
"My problem with the F4 car is locking up my brakes, I’m hoping my load cell pedal that’s coming in helps a bit"
hahah wow thats right
Dude same! Even with the bias dialed down to 58.2% I still lock them up constantly. I don't think the elevation changes in the hairpins help either
"I got my “load cell” last week from MOZA. Disappointed to the max

https://preview.redd.it/0vhj3aes3pcc1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=79fa2a22293f78975f6121d84ce43b02b940ee84

The spring is single rate and is not progressive, the rubber is just a solid block of rubber. Compressed, maybe 1/4” with all I could put on the pedal without pushing the whole  pedal/floor through the wall. IOW: MOZA; le suck gran !"
"Damn that sucks, I got the load cell upgrade from fanatec. Hoping it’s pretty good"
Don’t forget to reset the brake in the settings like I did.
"Good advice, practice is not only there for you to beat your best lap in optimal conditions, you should also practice actual racing"
"Even without damage, the tires are likely overheated, which is good to practice with as well. It takes a different mindset to take whatever pace you can get without overdriving to bring the tires back into range over a lap or two. It’s different from bringing the tires up to temp from cold, and it’s so easy to fall into the trap of sliding too much trying to go fast and just make it progressively worse."
I learned the quickest by doing AI races. It forces you to learn how the track and car respond to different lines off of the ideal racing line. Plus it was great fun and no waiting on scheduled times.
"And if you're hotlapping and you spin out, yeah your lap is shot but you can still work on sector times."
"I'd say the same about races. Some people immediately leave races after crash. I understand if it's 20 mins of repairs in 25 mins race – makes no sense, but if it's 2 mins repair then why leave? In both cases iRating is lost but one can have nice fights still with another unlucky mates and someone can crash so the final position can improve.  


I did this on Saturday in the Roar. I got killed on lap 7 being 8th or so, had 5 minutes of repairs, 3 laps down, 47th. Spent nice next 2 hours driving in a group, practicing the lines, off-lines and so on. Once I'm already there and allocated 3 hrs of my time it's way more interesting then just hotlapping alone. Finished 32th btw."
"Great advice! This is something I learned and carried with me from my competitive Pokémon days. During unranked matches as practice, people would often quit if their strategy is ruined in the first few turns. They would never learn how to recover and turn the match around"
If you have damage that makes it difficult to drive the car you should tow anyway. It would likely be faster and you wouldn't risk wrecking other people.
"This works for oval too, but at a less frequent rate.

If you didn't hit the wall, continue on."
"Yes!, Friend of mine used to constantly do this in practices, every little spin, partial slide, hell if the back end broke loose in a corner a little too much..Pull over and reset. Then he'd wonder why his car would drive like shit the further it got into a run. I'm pretty sure the first 2 years he was on, he never ran a car below 3/4 of a tank of fuel in a practice session."
"Big yes, i only reset if its damaged"
"Also— take advantage of racing around other people. Be aggressive. Be safe, don’t intentionally wreck people; but yeah, make the moves, see if they stick. Defend. All the things. That’s what open practice is far. 


I so often see people in practice sessions who will move way over and slow down for a person when they come up on them, or who will slow down to create big gaps between them and other cars. Do private testing if you’re needing to learn the track or can’t complete a clean lap. Open practice is for racing with other people! And following behind someone can be great practice too, if they’re fast!"
"Maybe a taboo activity but I like to practice overtaking in open practice too. Always very clean and no dive bombs. Just trial different lines and ol’ switcheroos, drafting etc. 
Obviously this is sometimes not possible or just plain unsafe but you should always practice weird lines before the race. Pretend you are two wide and are on the inside of the corner or leave car widths gap on each apex. 

Original Post is also about practicing entering the pit. Entering at speed is difficult and I guarantee there’s people that don’t even know where the entrance is!"
I like to see if others in the practice session of a similar ir want to go around together and do some close racing and see where overtaking is possible. Most people won't but it's great when one or two do.
Tyres are cooked after a spin
"Another point in practice: you can safely exit pits without destroying others' lap times. I think 1/5 driver exit pits with checking mirrors and slowing down, not more.
If there are more than 10 drivers on practice servers it's hardly useful to lap there, because people think T1 needs to be taken full speed out of pits. Afterwards, the outlap blocking devil is on his way.."
"I took some damage in a race. I felt the car was driving well enough to continue. I was doing pretty well until a few laps later I was Black flagged for not pitting to get repaired. So, it is not up to the driver if the car is in drivable shape or not. I drive in VR and the flags are not in view unless I look up and to the left. Lost 78 points for that."
Active Reset is also a thing so you don't have to start from the pits to practice turn one on cold tires.
"Great advice, also if there is time run a dozen laps and try right sides only, some places it’s as fast (or faster) as 4 and 3-4 seconds faster in the pits! Useful in long green flag races"
Usually I will zap out if I end up back on the track when braking. I'm pretty decent of clearing the track in practice when I fumble. I'm not trying to surprise a hotlapper around a bend and get creamed.
"I understand your point but You cant just say that as an absolute every situation. Lets say youre new to the sim, track, and car, yea, do that til you make 5 laps without a spin, but lets say youve got a good handle now your pushing the limits and have an incident, even a wall scrub, or a quick spin and go. You immediately knock off percentage on whichever corner tire had the most scrub, and the damage from even a scrub on the wall can change how the entire car handles, and you will waste your time trying to improve with the car like that. Obviously endurances races etc youll have to stay out, but practice is to practice the car as its supposed to be setup... no two damaged set of tires or cars drive the same."
"Agree, practice rejoins and also practice taking the next corner or two at differing speed. missing a brake point and overshooting a corner, might cause the next straight to have an extra bit of speed, you should adjust to counter that or you might over shoot the next turn too. Similarly, if your slower, later braking and being able to adjust to that difference is good too.

Should also practice alternate lines, how would you drive if a car got along side you, or you got along side another car?"
So we should just practice with overheated tires?
"Practice is for pushing absolute the hardest, I’ve grown to not reset unless I’m completely destroyed and I’ve been practicing only on full tank"
Can’t stress this enough for all racing but especially ovals. Your tires will be so cooked and it’s good to feel what it’s like afterwards and how it affects the rest of your run. AI races are great for this too.
"Word 👍
I only exit when the car isn't driving anymore 🤣"
I had someone faster than me continually pass and then let me pass them so they could do it again.  Was actually fun trying to block him and got to practice different racing lines and ways of blocking.
Probably noob question but could you explain what you consider when driving with cold vs overheated tyres ?
I did a ton of AI races with the F4 till I felt comfortable around other cars in a real race. Ended up grading 18 and placing 15th my first race
"I agree, staying in the race even after a short repair saves SR and you can even get places back.

In my Roar race I was 7th in class (TCR) on lap 30 and taken out by a LMP3. Was kind of annoying because I was starting to get faster times than those in front so was hoping to make up some spots. 

Limped back to the pits, had 30 sec required repairs and 4 mins optional. At this point there was already 1-2 that dropped out and another guy 2L back. Was in 12th. Completed 2 mins of optional repairs and got back out there, and just managed the traffic coming through. Picked up a couple incidents but just hammered through the laps. 

About 60 laps in 3 cars must have had a big accident and they all dropped off. Up to 9th, then another guy DNF'd 5 laps from the end and I ended up 8th. Gained SR, got 5 iR and got to experience my first enduro.

Always better to finish the race if you can."
Because driving around alone at the back is not fun. I race to have fun. Some things are just that simple.
"Ditto with chess, lots of people quit if you catch them out early on - especially if you trick them into losing their Queen without realising it. Playing the match down material is important experience as it forces you to get better at forming your own traps to try and equalise"
"Honestly when practicing oval I just carry on if I spin and didn't hit the wall since it's often gonna take me just as long, if not longer, to get back up to speed from the pits. May as well just keep going from where I am"
Which is also good practice
You don't instantly get new tires if you spin in a race.
"If you haven't changed the key bind, `alt+K` will let you move the UI elements to be more visible. In your app ini, I also suggest setting in `forceVisibleWhenMove=1`, which will make every UI element visible when you do the `alt-K` command."
"Good point, need to watch for the meatball flag. I also use VR, I recommend moving the UI so you can see the flags, it's alt+k I'm pretty sure."
This literally just happened to me and I'm pretty upset because I was still lapping faster than the two cars in front of me.
Does the spotter not tell you?
"Also best way to learn any track or car is mentally think if you wreck it, you got to pay for it, just like real life. Suddenly youll take bout 5 percent throttle off on entry and exit for the first few laps, then push to the edge, like youd do in a real life first ever test."
"I enjoy both sides of that scenario. I’ve had fast guys pull up behind me and hound me for several laps, which is great for practicing staying focused under pressure. Slower guys often seem to jump out of the way, and while I appreciate them being considerate, I love it when they try to hang in there and make me work to get by and stay by."
"I was actually in a practice session like 2 hours before the ROAR this weekend doing the same thing. Dude was running close behind forcing me to defend into T1 every lap and it was really beneficial as I hadn’t had much practice running defensive lines prior to this. It really helped me get the most out of the defensive line into 1 and ended up being incredibly useful in my race. 

I rarely win races but I put it on pole in the LMP3 and won the race after this. I had to defend a lot in the opening laps and the closing laps and I credit my defense to the guy racing me in the public lobby. It helped a lot."
Just remember blocking is illegal in iRacing in most circumstances.
"I kind of do the same thing on Superspeedway Ovals. Find someone to tandem draft with and practice being pushed and also being the pusher, get used to when to pull out of line to make a move. Better than just riding as a single car for 2.5 miles"
"Both respond similarly in that they lack grip, but there’s a little more margin on cold tires vs overheated tires, especially after a bad spin. More importantly, a little sliding on cold tires may throw your front/back balance off for a bit, but it’s not bad. Slipping overheated tires though will make those tires even more prone to sliding, and the more worn they are, the there greater the drop in grip if you keep sliding them. It can quickly become a downward spiral that brings on additional spins if you don’t give them time to cool down."
overheated tires = less grip
"Exactly. Racing is not only about door-to-door fights. Ppl say ""It iS SiMulAtOR"" but prefer to simulate only till the moment they got out. What about also simulating dealing with frustration, anger while trying to make some good pace?  


When you do local go-kart events and someone pushes you out or you make a mistake you don't get out and say ""I'm done here. When is the next time slot?"" but race till the end."
"Ovals are much more forgiving and fun when it comes to wrecks. You never spend more than 5 minutes without being door to door, even on the super speedways."
"The only times I don't would be if there's too many cars in the practice session for me to find an opening, or if I was making a full run and I'd already passed the number of laps I needed to make and was just testing where I completely lost my tires."
"Thanks, great idea!"
"I had a lot of this in some practice sessons, dunno if they're being jerks or actually trying to help, but it prepaired me for the real deal, which i was able to hold steady. And the faster guy behind me made a mistake and soun himself."
I’d hope that by ‘blocking’ they really mean more like ‘keeping the door closed and running a defensive line’.
[deleted]
cold tyres have less grip too? Im asking about the difference
"Ovals with yellows can actually be fun trying to strategize after a wreck. If I have optional repairs at a track that is often wrecked on (which is like all of them, lol), repairing as much as I can without going a lap down can be a fun and stressful strategy. I’ve gone from wrecked early on to finishing top 10 with the pack before."
"Yeah thats what I meant, I wasnt swerving in braking zones or anything like that.   He did it 4 or 5 times, we never made contact."
"Same, that is legal, but what most do is simply not."
"have you tried reading the sporting code? because ""one defensive move"" is not in it."
Same mentality that races on the weekend 🤣. Amazing how few people know the actual code of conduct.
"I would say cold and overheated tires drive about the same. 

Overheated tires are real slippery, have to drive a few laps calmly to get them to cool down. 

If you have the Ferrari, or LMP2, they have live tire temps on the dash, you can hop in one of those, do a big burnout with some donuts and try it out."
"Yes. Grip-wise they're both about the same. Physics-wise, cold rubber isn't elastic enough and overheated is too much so"
"Not sure if you're pointing out that the person you are responding to is wrong or if you're agreeing with them, so let's be clear for others: you are not allowed to move in reaction to the person behind you. You are not allowed to block. You may move as many times as you like as long as you move first. But as  soon as that move is reactionary, that's against the sporting code."

"Congrats mate, IMSA is great fun"
"Well fuck that shit bro, congratulations to you and savour it !!!  Post a finish line clip man, damn sure you will have saved the replay right??? ;)"
"Yea yeahhh!! That’s an amazing feeling! Congrats man! I feel like a lot of us are in similar positions. Insanely fun race, but when it’s over - we can only give ourselves high fives lol 

Here’s a 🖐️"
Awesome job. 👏
Congratulations!
Good shit man
That’s awesome man! Congrats!
Congrats on the podium! Here's to moving on to 45min and longer races soon. I write little 1-2 paragraph summaries of my races and text to my dad. He gets a kick out of it and I've got someone (although not immediately around) to share my passion with.
"Well done mate, I'm sure lots of us sim racers have the same issue :D when I get a good result and tell my wife she looks at me as if I was crazy lol 

We have your back ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"
"Like many of us on iRacing… you turn to Reddit for praise, haha. Congrats! 🎉"
Good job.  I have to laugh though because every time someone talks about racing in VR they always mention how miserable they were.
Nice work man.  That's super exciting.  A license race@  WOw
Hell yeah. It's races like that that keep you coming back. There really isn't much like it.
I believe I may have been in your race as a GT3. You two running for first were racing hard all race! Congrats on the podium!
Congratulations on the podium!! 🥳
"Nice! Just a week ago I was proudly bragging to my wife about my first IMSA GT3 win. 

I couldn’t have picked a worse audience."
"Congrats! I know how it is. You work hard. Learn the track. Learn the car. Put tons of time and effort in. Win a huge win. Log off. Back to nothing. 

It hurts."
"I also race in VR, and read it more as he was sweating because when you're racing in VR (in my opinion) every race, every turn feels like such high stakes. Because you feel like you're actually in the car at the track. 

My heart rate is always higher after a VR race than after a monitor race. Without fail."
Biggest problem with my driving is the loose nut behind the wheel.
"Congrats!

Got my first win tonight also and had similar stress lol.

Led for 10 laps and built a 12s gap on p2 but was still anxious something was going to go wrong until I crossed the finish line.

Longest 10 laps of my life including having a car exit in front of me from the pits on the last lap - yikes. Fortunately the guy crashed two turns later."
Such a long winded post and you don’t mention the series or track?!
“I hope your sacrifice will fuel the flame of racists worldwide” AYOOO
"Super cool. I am at 130  races and got my first win 2 days ago...  I have been ""farming SR"" more than you as I am A class so I could race IMSA (which I am not good at but improving, lots of crashes due to multi-class but after the first one I have been able to survive clean).   I think every class can have shit show races.  But some series like VRS Endurance (B class) are generally super clean even at the bottom split.   Mazda Advanced (c class) seems fairly reasonable but I only raced it 4 times at Daytona.  Lots of off tracks but not so many crashes."
"Wow you must be good to get your first win vut how good

https://preview.redd.it/thgwwn7jmjcc1.png?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac4937b769ca8fff619bde9edfccfbebaa4c41b5"
Where the hell did the shout out to all the racists worldwide come from? Did you mean to type “racers”?
For real. Trying to know which series to avoid this week.

I believe it’s called a joke
"Calling it progression is a bit of a misstatement since while you need license class to drive faster cars; there is no requirement to drive those cars nor is it inherently better racing.

You can do very competitive racing in the rookie cars if you race in the higher splits."
"when you click on a series in the UI the window that pops up will have a bunch of tabs at the top (sessions, entries, etc). Click the one that says ""Schedule"" and it'll show a list of all of the past and upcoming tracks. You can click the blue thing on the right of each entry to test drive that track."
"Laguna is fun, but has a lot of difficult corners that can make identifying issues and improving difficult, with the delta bouncing everywhere.

I’d give Lime Rock a go in MX5 or one of the junior formulas. It’s very good at teaching you the importance of being really precise and under control as there’s basically 2-3 opportunities per lap to gain time and you then get rewarded or punished. Once you’ve learned the track you’ll set a time close to your optimum- and then you’ll hit bit of a ceiling and to improve further you’ll need to improve your understanding of cornering or feel by a couple of hundredths at a time to improve."
"GT4 would be a logical step between MX-5 and GT3, maybe try one of those? You'll be able to race them in D"
"You can buy the  Nordschliefe now, buy the Porsche GT3 and race the track against AI straight away or just Test on the track. The only thing you can't do is race in competion until you get the required ratings. But it's super fun and you need to drive the track a lot to get used to it.

Do it, have fun! it's the first two purchases I ever made as a rookie."
I think road America is the best track for learning driving fundamentals
Are you connected to wifi or via Ethernet cable?
Packet loss is the biggest factor in blinking. If you're on WiFi try connecting using Ethernet and see if that helps. You need to be wired all the way from your PC to the modem; using switches is okay.
It’s more about your modem and router than pc specs.
"That download latency is really high, no? The upload isn't great either."
"If you aren’t running straight into the router then you’re going to blink. WiFi isn’t really acceptable for any gaming these days, much less something high speed like racing. Run a cable to the router"
I used to run on WiFi and would blink.  Ethernet removed all those issues
it’s a little weird - i’m connected through an ethernet cable which is connected to a wifi amplifier
Yeah iracing seems to really hate WiFi
I think I’ve found your problem. You need to connect it directly to the router
"Connecting it directly to the router may be a problem considering that I still live with my parents and they probably won’t move it just so I have the better-than-average internet connection, but I’ll try to convince them and update you with the results."
Don’t have to move the router. Run a cable
"1. Watch Suellio's video on brake rotation.  Move the brake bias back.
2. Watch Suellio's long video Tire Surface Temperature with Alberto Naska

The two of those videos will transform your experience in the Ferrari 296."
"tbf the ferrari is just not that good at hock. Trail braking is key for the Ferrari, you must use it for rotation. Good thing is you don't have to drive it. I try to avoid it as well."
"You're not the only one that struggles with this car.

I'm at 4.4k iR and can get most cars quite close to topsplit pole- pace. But with the 296, I feel like I did a great lap only to find out I'm 1.1 second off pole time and slower than drivers with sub 3k iR. 

Charlotte has been horrendous this week for me...

Interesstingly with the 488 GT3 on the older tire model, I had no issue at all. Then when they updated the tires (2-3 seasons ago) it got worse and with the 296 even more.

If I don't trail brake enough, the car understeers crazy and if I do trailbrake a bit, the car always wants to step out on the rear. And if I manage to get the rotation really well for a whole lap, I'm still that 1s off the pace...

Looked at VRS data and they can just maintain a smooth slip angle on entry and exit over the rear without it actually stepping out. When I try the same, I just loose the rear on entry or TC kills my exit.

I just think the car has a very narrow sweetspot wih just a bit of slip.  And at least I can't find that spot."
This car is inherently understeery which sucks. Trail braking is important.
"The Ferrari has been way off the pace against the other GT3 cars based on what I’ve seen. 

There’s a reason all the others were pegged back on power for the Daytona 24 BOP."
Have you thought about driving it faster?
"I'm in the same boat, I wanted to like the 296 but I'm just natively slower in it so why bother."
"I know how you feel, I wanted to love the merc AMG but I just can’t get on with it, I jump in the Porsche and I’m over 1s faster"
"This, every car has different Characteristics and some require you point and enter turns differently as well as the brake bias as you mention. It’s why verstappen drives what he does he feels the car is a bit “pointier”"
"Came here to say something similar.
Once you start to understand how to rotate the cars more with pedal inputs time just starts dropping off"
Is there a car for which trail braking is not the key?
I thought about it but ultimately decided against it.
"Race cars are set up with a crazy amount of toe out at the front which makes them turn much tighter (oversteer) when you compress the front suspension by braking. It also makes it easier to spin.  

Street cars are set up with toe in, so they will straighten up and resist turning or spinning (understeer) if you jump on the brakes. 

With the Ferrari, being rear engined, and very little travel on the front suspension, to get the best turning performance, you often need to make brake balance adjustments for particular corners. Sometimes a tap or two, forward or rear can make all the difference on a troublesome corner. On some tracks, you'll be adjusting the brake balance forward and back every lap.

With the Porsche, you tend to just keep adjusting the brake balance to the rear as the race progresses, because the Porsche fuel tank is in the front. As you use fuel, you need to move the brake balance to the rear to compensate.

I don't know about the other GT3's, but I bet they all have their little quirks when it comes to brake balance."
"I was talking about visualisation or imagery Many pros use it for various sports but it’s become very popular in elite motorsports over the last decade. 

I’ve found it useful for driving the more tricky cars.

"I guess I meant, is there a road course car in iracing that doesn't require trail braking to be fast? Because pretty much every post in this sub that is to the effect of ""why am I slow in x car"" has comments saying ""this specific car needs trail braking"", which implies that other cars don't. I have never driven a car on iracing or otherwise that didn't need it. The closest I can think of was the formula vee, just because the engine braking and massive weight transfer did most of the work for you"
Still looking for someone?
"I’m GMT timezone and 2k irating, looking to drive the caddy and can do a couple of stints"
Does anyone need a team for Daytona? Friend and I are looking for a third for BMW GTP
Still looking for driver ? My irating is 1360 b class. Need someone to race with. Cadillac gtp
Yeh what’s your irating?
How available are you can how many stints can you do
952
Also what lap times are you getting
"Running in the 33’s on the long runs, I can double stint but can’t run during the night."
Recalibrate in your pedals software then recalibrate in game.
that worked. i tried to recalibrate in game and that didnt work. I didnt try to recalibrate the wheel/pedal set up because it was fine in AC. Thanks
Raced this morning. Zero issues with the UI. T1 on the other hand…
"*Sometimes* it will take a minute or so to register,  but that's usually when I forget to and join in the last 90 seconds."
Did you try turning your computer off and then turning it back on?
UI sucks period but tomorrow iracing is going to force us to use it
I just raced IndyCar at 1:15 EST and had zero issues with iracing
Uninstall and reinstall and seems to be fine. Weird.
Having the same issue and restarting does not seem to help. Hopefully they fix this in the next update.
Only had this for the ROAR.  Registering was chaos.  But nothing else since.
Prob your computer dude. If a uninstall and reinstall fixed it. You might have some bad sectors or or sectors going bad if it’s a disk drive
The thing I notice is I'm getting on average 16% lower FPS with the new UI. It's  very repeatable.
"My issues weren’t just registering, it was every option in UI. Paint booth, schedules, etc."
"Yes, this has been noticeable for a few days. I shut the pc down after each use."
"I have some different issues with iRacing and I’m also considering reinstalling it. Since you just did it, can I ask you if it’s a painless process?"
"Yikes, that's rough. I'm really not too sure, but hope someone who knows more than me can get you sorted out."
"It doesn’t seem to be any different for me.

The iRacing software is quirky. Last season, for the entire season I couldn’t see the server location for each session listed in the ui. I didn’t change anything. I asked here and like your situation, everyone that responded was like “idk, works for me.”

I just dealt with it, and with the build change for this season, it was back to normal. I did nothing to try to fix it, it just came back when the season changed. I don’t know if there are system specific changes or what.

Best thing to do if you want to try to fix it is to just do a fresh install."
"Sorry man I used to work at help desk you got to ask these things 

Did you try reinstalling it?"
"It was easy. Uninstall, then redownload from the website.  Only took a few minutes. The lagging got a good bit better, but not completely gone. There were probably 60-70 D24 servers in hosted along with everything else going, I’m guessing high traffic is bottling it down some."
"There was an update that hid columns depending on screen width. You could have gotten the column back if you made sure your screen was maximized or lowered the UI zoom. 

People didn’t like the change so it was changed again to show more columns."
I'm trying to improve my laptimes but I cannot seem to find the last 2 seconds. Please help!
"You can be quick without knowing the little tips on track limits. You can't be quick if you can't drive with the right techniques.

Good news is you can teach yourself both with free resources and time spent in the seat."
"First rule of finding lap times: learn to control your inputs, especially when typing lol"
I think if you post your telemetry link here people would be willing to help. Would be better than the “who’s at fault” and “should I protest this” posts
Suellio almeda
Ask me anything about driving. I will give free info that no one can tell. Trust me.
"As a minimum, watch the fastest lap of the race winner after you finish every race. Free, and will probably expose differences in lines, track boundary exploits, and brake zones."
"Watch the fastest guys in your split. I'll spectate a few races in my split range and ride along with the fast folks on their qualifying and race lines. The real trick is to try and get incrementally faster don't go for folks that are 5+ seconds faster find someone who is slightly faster and build pace that way. 

When all else fails try coaching. Find someone who offers lessons specifically in the car you wanna learn"
"I bought the Suellio course and it's helped me figure out what and where I am deficient in driving. I was consistently 2 seconds off the leaders in any split I ended up in. And after going thru the course, I was half a second off  a 9k driver in the GT3s at Mugello on my fastest lap in a race.

I still have a lot to work on. Mainly my consistency and controlling my off tracks. But it has helped a lot, where I am happy with the results even if I'm not winning, I can keep up with the leaders. At least for now, that's all I've really wanted to be able to do

That said, Suellio's YouTube videos are free, and you can still get a lot from them; nearly every subject in the paid course is there. The course offers more detail and further explanation."
Both things can be learned way more effective in Garage61 for free
3k driver here currently focusing on f4. I’m about 0.5 - 0.8 second slower than top guy various track
"Coaching. If you actually want to get better, you need someone who knows. You don't know what you don't know. You can't see what's wrong because you don't know what you're looking for.

Find someone like Suellio Almeida and get them to analyze your driving and give you drills to improve it.

Then you have to intentionally practice ... but we'll get to that. :)"
"G61 and compare your lap data, free and easy."
"Most guys are practicing all wrong. 
Don’t practice to be fast over a single lap. 

Really practice braking. 
Really practice corner exits. 
Really practice perfect lines. 

Etc. Practice certain skills and then you’ll be better over time. 

If you play soccer i.e., you don’t train a match. You train certain skills which you use in a match. 

I personally can not do this. I get bored to fast and I’m not talented enough. I will always be mid range good and that’s perfectly fine for me now."
"I already pay for iracing, the last thing I would do is pay for a “coach”…."
I know it’s a meme but those who want to go faster. Watch fast guys race and slowly adapt there inputs then adjust as you see fit to have it fit your style. That’s what I do. Also watching racing IRL helps too in a way. At least for me
I have tried 1 month of cda it was my worst 10 dollars spent. I hope I would have lost that money instead. so whomever find he would have done more useful things.
They guys! Racing is hard.
I have been stuck here for YEARS. Its always the same shit no matter how much i practice i end up 2 seconds off pace in top split from lead guys. I cant really tell if im improving and lead guys also find extra time or am i just stuck in personal skill sealing.
Go back in time and tell your dad to marry max verstappan's mom instead of yours.
"Some tracks, you're going to be few tenths down unless you really know the quirks, even if your technique is flawless. e.g. Watkins Glen this week in IMSA, if you don't put your right side tire between the curb and the barrier on the entry to the bus stop, you're either losing a tenth+ or dead, if you don't carry enough speed so you go beyond the curb at the exit of turn 8 (heel of the boot) you lose another tenth+, and if you don't go beyond the curb at the exit of turn 10, another tenth there."
Thyping*
"I love checking my telemetry.

""Oh, look at that, this alien two seconds faster than me is doing exactly what I'm doing. Just better."""
Tbf he does give some good advice in his free vids at times.
"I’ve done coaching session with him he has a PhD in simracing 
His free YouTube (specifically recorded coaching sessions) stuff is really really good too"
"If I drive 26mph in a 20mph zone (the entire country), where do I live?"
Why did she leave me
how I press break if no feet
"But as far as coaching, Suellio Almeda’s YT content is really good considering it’s free"
How do you ride along people on their qualifying lap ?
"Imagine getting an expensive guitar and then saying ""the last thing I would do is pay for lessons"". Feel free to be self-taught, but nothing weird about paying for coaching."
compensating for something?
At least you understood it was a meme
It’s because you need more expensive equipment and a cooler livery from TradingPaints. Duh.
What are you practicing exactly? Just turning laps over and over or focusing on improving specific parts of your driving?
"If you’re 2 seconds off top split, before you beat yourself up too much, you should know that the pros oftentimes use pro setups that are OP or their own setups that they’ve spent literally 10s of hours on. Suellio Almeida mentioned this in his most recent livestream - he was the F3 champion 3 seasons in a row and credits his wins to all his setup work. “I was slower on paper than my opponents but my setups were so good I ended up being faster.”"
"\> personal skill sealing.

It's definitely just this. And probably an order of magnitude more practice from the top guys. It's not as though everyone else is getting faster...lap times would trend to 0:00 and they, obviously, do not."
Wait are you implying Max doesn't get his talent from Jos? 🤔
80% is just the racing line and braking
I bought the course and found that it is very helpful especially for iracing. There is a section about tire temps that gave me great insight into why iracing is so punishing at times. His methods of explaining can be helpful depending on how you learn.
His free video coaching he did with a pro on trail braking led to me winning my first race the same day.
Wales
That would be Wales
England for sure
Wales
You are so much better for her
Use legs
"Join a race as a spectator not a participant

When the race registration ends clock the series and the. Click watch on the split you want, lower numbers are higher splits"
"I hired a guy one time for 15 bucks off fiverr and it changed my braking so much, for the better . Like I spend hundreds of hours on this sim, hundreds on equipment and content, wtf is 15-30 bucks to get some coaching every now and then"
This 100%.
I don't know how people didn't understand the joke? Did they not read past the header? It's quite clearly a joke about the different learning resources that exist and not actually a cry for help lmao
"Red Bull livery: -0.3s/lap

And -2.0 SR"
Trading paints pro is worth -.5s
"Lol, those setups are not worth 2 seconds or a whole 1 second. They will clap you with a fixed set too. Some of the sets are so difficult to drive the average driver would be slower with them. 90% of the time is in using all the track, being smooth with your inputs and carrying more speed through corners.

Source: I'm 8k and have access to ""pro"" setups."
"For someone who is 3k and is about a 5-8 tenths off the pace, do you think I’ll get value in the course? I feel like I understand technique at a fairly deep level, but I obviously am not applying it correctly. The other option is coaching, but just wanted to understand how much going through the course can help me in terms of finding those last few tenths"
Which one is that?
Ye I would say England too cause he used mph instead of kmh
Nope wales
"“I’m just like my hero Max Verstappen!”

“You’re really really fast and adaptable?”

“What? No. I’m a psychopath the second any other car is within murdering distance.”"
You say -0.3s/lap as if Red Bull livery guys were able to complete more than one lap.
"tbh in really specific tracks, the pro setups for goofy cars like the IR01 can give you that time lol"
"Obviously OP just needs some coaching because he’s banging his head against the wall, but in the hands of a driver who knows how to drive them, those setups are worth like half a second. I’ve been in plenty of top split races where the top 2 or 3 guys are 8 and 9k and are half a second or more ahead of the next drivers."
"I tried changing setups for the first ever time over the weekend. I just grabbed the fastest free setup from the list of lap times on Garage 61, and ended up 1.6 seconds faster than my previous PB.

This was for the Advanced Mazdas at Spa so it's a long lap with a lot of time available, but prior to that I was pretty consistently at that slower pace.

TL;DR - there's obviously a lot more that goes into being quick, but setups seem to make a bigger difference than I ever gave them credit for (for me, at least)."
That's tough to answer. The course is quite long and extensive so you never know what you might be just missing. I will say that he mentions several times during the course that you can ask for a refund no questions asked. He only claims to want to help. At the very least you could try it.
"Im in the same boat as you, and i would say theyre complementary.

I found the course helpful though imo it wont find you time immediately but more explains some things that seemed like magic before and gives you new ideas.

Coaching is far better and quicker at finding laptime in the short term imo."
"I'm pushing 4k iRating. Usually .25-.3 off pace, the course is well worth it.  I find that I better understand why I'm doing things, most of it is stuff I already do, but it changes how I think about my approach more often. 

Also worth mentioning, great info on how the sim works and how to be faster on iRacing.  

Some things in iRacing are different from real life, and I struggle more on sim than in the real car, his course has helped me understand the sim side of racing a lot better, highly recommend it."
https://youtu.be/yHFTdVj-L3w?si=an900-fPJuUb1ZTV
No. I watched so many driving instructor videos on YouTube and saw that most of people in traffic were exceeding speed limit in Britain
Nope it's Wales

"![gif](giphy|FAavjYJVev88aCorNY)

Me after wrecking half the field in turn 1"
"Yeah, because they're 9k lol, not because of the setup. People underestimate the gap between a good driver and a *great* driver. They do little things that are worth less than half a tenth every corner and it just adds up. I'm also 3 tenths faster than 6k drivers, using a random VRS set. I get beaten by teammates on the same set because they're just better than me at simracing."
No.
"there's a difference between jumping from baseline to any custom setup and from any custom setup to a 'pro setup' - it is also a matter of what car we're talking about. The mx5 has no iracing support on setups so if there is a small trick to make the car faster, most custom setups will use that and be much faster. A car with downforce will have to be setup with the right wings and rake for the track or it could be way off. The more complicated the car, the more room for pro setups to make a difference. The more recent the car, the less likely to allow for setup exploits."
"Thank you, appreciate the reply"
"Thank you, appreciate the reply. I think it’s well worth getting and going through, if nothing else I find the material very interesting to read"
"Appreciate it, thank you. From a money perspective I think it’s well worth it then especially considering how much I’ve already spent on hardware. 

I think I have a common problem of not consistently using the grip of all 4 tyres on entry. Neutral steer I think is what he calls it. I tend to use more steering angle than most VRS coaches which makes me believe that I’m below the grip threshold at the rear (not applying enough real braking to rotate the car), and over the limit at the fronts"
What do you mean?
Yep I don’t disagree with you.
Uh yes.
"This is one of the things that it really helps with. You know you should be doing it, but consistently doing it safely is another thing.

The course helps develop a better method to get it right consistently imo."
[deleted]
No setup is worth half a second over something like a generic VRS setup. Maybe 2 tenths in a pretty uncommon scenario where the pros found some weird behavior that happens to work.
"Makes sense, thank you. Also, if you don’t mind me asking - what element of your driving improved the most when you went from 3k to 4k?

Did you see a significant step up in terms of raw pace (and if so, in what part of your driving), or was it more things like race craft and consistency? 

Just trying to create a roadmap of what I need to work on to get to 4k, which is kind of my end goal for now"
Wales and England are different countries
I never said it’s worth half a second over a VRS setup.
"
*
It's mostly just consistency in neutral steer for me.  My opt would always be right about where the top irating guys would qualify, my issue was consistently nailing it.

I also just swapped from 49"" to triples, and I can already tell I'm driving more naturally.  Looking ahead vs reference fixation. That's the big thing for me!

My race craft, imo is still lacking from where it needs to be, I took a lot of time off of iracing while I moved and I'm just getting serious again and built a new rig all last week.  So I'm excited to really practice a bit more.  (Ignore the wires I haven't addressed them yet...)"
"You said an 8k/9k driver is half a second up on the next fastest driver, then later said ""those setups are worth like half a second"". Those ""next fastest"" drivers are mostly using VRS or some other paid setup. So, through the transitive property (lol, I just really wanted to say that), your statement is saying that a pro setup is half a second faster than a VRS setup."
"Thanks! I guess I need to learn the feeling of neutral steer and gentle controlled rotation that I can do consistently without spinning out. 

Rig upgrades are always exciting. May it serve you well!"
"You can either go right next to the wall, or you can stay off the curb. There's no in between. (This is true for most cars in that corner.)

Bonus points if you manage an off-track there without hitting the wall lol"
"That corner has 2 correct paths. I say it that way because if you go in between then, there's a high chance of losing the car.

You're probably experiencing it correctly.

Need to either learn the safe inside path or the riskier but faster outside path."
"I had the same problem last time with the 296. Never had those issues before with the 488.

You have either to play ist save and go left of the curb or u go directly beneath the wall, what is quicker but more risky. Never hit that bump though"
"Was the same for everyone, I gained so much IR this week by taking the safe line and just waited for those ahead to crash out."
Just go play the yakuza games
I dont know about Japanese but i moved to italy and am learning italian and my spotter is italian
Just got to 2k this week as well. Started in October!
Congrats! It's all about the mindset. I was hovering around 1800-2000 and when I changed my mindset I jumped to 2300 like it was nothing.
Perfect for the screenshot that you landed exactly on 2k!!
"Congrats on the 2k, remember to to enjoy the racing and not focus on the irating. Not that your doing it but I made that mistake and ended up going backwards. As soon I forgot about the irating and was just in the moment of the race my irating went back up. Now I'm knocking on the door of 3k."
"Haha same for me, after being stuck in 1600-1700 this weekend i finally went to 2071 ir racing the radical cup, so happy hehe"
"Congrats on reaching 2k! 

Out of curiosity, how many race starts before you hit 2k? that's to all you 2k+ers out there"
Now you just need to learn how to make screenshots
"Congrats dude.  I just hit 1500, the week of my 1yr anniversary with iRacing. I know that’s a dogshit iRating for being in it for a year, but I’m going to use being a quad/para as an excuse, at least partially, not having a comparable option to a load cell brake, does suck, but I’m sure there are other disabled sim racers that would blow my doors off, so I can’t put it all on that. But getting to and being able to maintain a 2-2.5K iRating is my goal by the end of year 2.  I do think the window from 1.5-2, has gotta be tough to do, so congrats to you for getting there, and may the pace be with you on your way to 3k."
Congratulations 👏
Well done not easy
Never races again 😂
![gif](giphy|xxPKxNm5Srvna)
"Congrats. I'm trying very, very hard to get back to 2000. Currently it's not going well. I've gotten as high as 1925 and then every time I get fairly close I get taken out back down to 1600 or so. 2000 is my minimum goal. Once I hit it again I don't even want to be back below."
"Congrats, I'm up to 1600 this week which is fine for me now that I got promoted to B tonight. I'm sure I'll level off a bit until I improve on the shorter oval tracks."
Congrats man!
In Oval Racjng tho
"What was the mindset lol?

Been stuck at 1800-1900 for weeks, got up to 1966 and was on for 2k last night before I got sent to the shadow realm by an idiot at turn 4"
"'Finally made it it 2k! I was so close with 2.1k and even 2.03k before, but I finally did it'"
"Hell yeah man. I only ever use it as a motivator when shit goes sideways and I’m on a recovery drive, find it helps more than hurts there. Looking forward to Spa next week in F4."
"Sitting at 129 starts right now, mainly open wheel. Started sim racing in late July and try my best to at least practice daily."
80 starts and 2.2k but if I go to open wheel I’ll certainly drop loads of ir
"I hit 2k for the first time in June 2023 after about 150 races. Before then I was hovering around 1.8k for 6 months. 

I went up and down a few times since, as low as 1.8k again in late November.

Now I'm in my third attempt at maintaining 2k. I'm currently in my all-time high of 2,087 after a successful Roar race (P3 in my split) last weekend. It will be tough as it is Daytona week in the IMSA series which I will probably exclusively run until we do the 24hr race with the team this weekend."
"Respect to you, man. You can probably blow my doors off and I'm not disabled.

Keep it up, brother."
Still have a lot to learn tho haha
"Stop trying to win, stop trying to pass.

Generally finishing in the top half-ish will earn you iRating and that's your goal. Focus on you, focus on your pace, focus on surviving. Watch and anticipate sends, work with drivers ahead to close the gap to the front pack, and attack in a way that mind punts the driver ahead."
🤘🏼
"Yea suposse good way to think, sometimes too desperate to win you throw away a 2nd/3rd

Just sat back tonight and let 2 people spin themselves out for an easy 4th, one positive result from the 2k barrier again. Fingers crossed dont get sent to the shadow realm on my next race lol

Only thing is the jump from 2nd split to top split f4 seems absolutely massive, goal is just to be able to hold my own mid pack in the top split"
"Exactly, it's so easy to lose it all because you wanted to push. If you don't have one already get an app like RaceLabs or Kapps and when you see where you need to finish to gain rating make that your goal, anything above that is just icing on the cake."
"It will get better once you start returning to tracks you’re already familiar with. But if you enjoy oval more, just do that. That’s the beauty of iRacing, you can always find something you’ll enjoy"
Road just takes more focus in general. A 45-50 minute session isn’t very long though. You probably just need to run more races of that length to build yourself up to where it’s not a big deal anymore. I don’t even consider races that are shorter than 30 minutes. There’s too much desperation in the driving in short races so guys will take more risk to gain positions. I just find the racing to be a lot worse in shorter races.
"I would consider myself to be a road enthusiast and btw here's my [selfie](https://microfilums.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/2260894625_ea1feecb2a.jpg).  


Honestly, just race whatever you enjoy more. Maybe you're just not in the right headspace for road right now and it'll come back to you later."
"Man I feel this. I got myself to C class rating to drive the GT3's and left the rest. It's a sweaty job.

Then I discovered IRX Rally Cross, the one that uses the VW Beetle. I'm absolutely loving it. Podium, finish on Saturday and got my first win last night. The mix of road and handbraking on the dirt is great fun."
GT3 road racing is one of the hardest and most competitive series in iRacing. Use it to challenge yourself. 😀
"This is why lots of people focus on one series only.


I am going through something similar.


The answer is practice, and don't take it too seriously.

I recently bought a whole batch of new tracks and a new car in one of those discount bundle permissions, and let me tell you, the mental load of learning those new tracks and that new car is pretty steep.

I also recently bought the HPD which happens to be going to a lot of the tracks in the batch I just bought and even though it's really really difficult to learn such a fast car and the track, I find that going back to a slower car is so much easier.


So what I've been doing lately is focusing on the HPD which is super fast so your brain just needs to process faster, and the Porsche cup which is super twitchy and slidey and it feels like you're driving on soap instead of rubber.

I'm pretty much at a level where I gain a little bit of irating sometimes and lose it other times in those series, but what that allows me to do is a it llows me to jump into a random gr Cup race or an advanced Mazda race with very little practice and I can just have fun.  I'm not going to lose a ton of irating, in fact in most cases I gain a little bit even though I finish like midish pack or 7th or whatever

The other thing I've noticed is it gets easier.   After learning Road America, Road Atlanta, Spa really well, Daytona was easier.


The track that has been fucking with me is Interlagos but that's next.   


The other thing I do is if I know I eventually want to participate in an official race on a track, I jump into a test drive session with no intention of joining a race that day.   I just kind of drive around and don't really try to set a good lap time but just sort of learn where all the edges of the track are and you know make all the mistakes that a new person learning a track is going to make.  Then I go to bed.   I have heard that getting a good night's sleep after learning something always helps solidify the lesson."
"I think as far as learning a track, you are correct that road is more difficult. I’m primarily an oval guy and have been to basically every oval track, so I can jump in and be up to pace relatively quickly. Road I dabble, and it takes much more time to get up to speed.

However, for the race, I feel oval required much more focus. Road I feel like if you get through the first few laps, everyone spreads out and you just gotta hit your marks. Oval can be white knuckle driving in traffic the entire time and 1 slip can end your race and several other guys. Caution comes out, bunch em back up and run it again. Controlled chaos for 100 laps is more taxing in my opinion"
"For me they are just completely different. i am like 95% Road. 

Oval is too simple but WAY to complex at the same time. Sure turning left seems simple but they race on eggs for tires. there is soo much into being fast for a whole stint that i have never put in the effort to master it. Indycar tire is more forgiving so i tend to run that more when they are at smaller tracks. Cautions in oval are just straight garbage IMO. they just kill the mood.

Road is more complex to learn a track but is more forgiving about not being absolutely perfect on your line. The tires are way better. you can run a 30min race full out and not pay anywhere near as hard of a price for killing your tires. especially in ABS cars.  Road, especially in multiclass, has more excitement and chaos IMO. 

i do not feel one is more tiring than the other though."
"I swear every time someone discusses VR all they talk about is how worn out they are. 

I ran the 2.4 hour roar on triples and wasn't phased at all. I get why people like VR but if it's that difficult to race with it is it really worth it?

To answer your question, after a while you get a road racing mindset. I've been sim racing 3 years (after racing IRL for 10 years) and I can go into a brand new track and be up to a decent pace and have the track memorized and set braking and turn in points in about 30 minutes. I can also switch from one car to another and be on pace pretty quickly too. I'm just 2.2k so I'm definitely not an alien. I've just developed my brain to remember this stuff and be adaptable."
I understand how you feel. I gave up GT3 and the faster classes that run the long tracks more or less for this reason. Also love Street Stock. It's the most fun I have on Iracing.
"The way me and my buddies do it is the first time we race a track on roads, it’s all in preparation for the next season when it’s back, sometimes tracks just rlly mesh with your style, for me it was interlagos and zandvoort and you’ll instantly be able to race for wins and contend, but others it’s just do ur best to learn the track and overtaking opportunities and hope to have a better go the next season. Just have fun and don’t blame everyone else for ur mistakes if they happen."
I feel this a lot.  As a dad I get 2-3hours of iracing time a week because that is all the free time I have.  The time to master a road course at a high level here is so much longer than an oval.  You can just knock out so many more laps!
"Enjoy practice as much as racing, or more even."
When you’re stuck pacing around the 9th caution in a C-fixed race then you’ll wish you were doing a road race 😂
You’re doing bare minimum prep work.
Driving left and right with dozens of different lines and braking points is more taxing on the brain than going left?  Mind Blown.
"You've explained exactly why most of the world laughs at American oval racing. It's simply easier. Calm down, I didn't say easy. And it has some fun unique skills, but objectively, there are less skills to master."
I enjoy the GT3 but prefer the GT4. Lately though the F4 series I finally tried has been my go to. Those cars are a damn blast to drive.
"I enjoy road races, they're less stressful to me than oval but oval is just more fun in my opinion. It's simple. Hit your marks, be patient, make your move when it presents itself. 

A lot of people think they'll hate oval until they try it."
"I can second that, however it's my first season on iRacing. We're racing against people who drove the cars and tracks for years. Of course we need to practice to get up to speed."
"Oh my god I was going to make an identical post to this. I feel the exact same way. My brain feels absolutely exhausted after each long road race, and I usually stick to the 20-30 minute races as I usually go into like airplane mode during longer races or just can't fully focus. I do love oval and have so much fun in oval races."
"I raced in 2017, did majority oval racing. Took a few years off because my kids were still 1 & 3 at the time. Now that they're older and they chill I got back into iRacing with focus primarly on road. 

Tanked my iR getting back into it, went from about 1k down to 500s, worked back up to almost 1k again. Steep learning curve but it was worth it now 3 seasons back. 

Ran my first ROAR over the weekend, was P1 majority of the race until an incident around L50 and had to pit a few laps early for fuel and repairs. Finished the race P5 with 1 lap of fuel to spare.

Road is rewarding once you get the hang of it, can put the laps in and seat time. I prefer road now to oval, but still have a place in oval in my heart. I grew up watching NASCAR, my wife and I are big nascar fans, hell we even had a tastefully done nascar theme wedding."
"I've practically quit road racing in its entirety. I've done strictly road for the last 5 years and lately I find myself in the 87 NASCAR's and the Truck series a lot, and lately I've been doing a handful of late model dirt as well. It's just more fun and the racing is much more wheel to wheel."
"> take more risk to gain positions

Also lower level splits are more about survival than clean fun racing. I'm finally almost a 1k iR driver and I have noticed the quality of racing has improved a bunch as my iR has improved. 

I was in the 500s for a bit and lap times were all over the place from people as long as you kept your nose clean it was usually a Top 3 finish"
I started iRacing with iRX. I stopped when I got to C Class and nobody was running it.
"Funny you mention that. I stepped away from pcup as I gained hella ir in interlagos and zand, 2 tracks I have hundreds almost thousand laps (from gt4, abs and tc helped a ton to learn at the beginning) 

But first month on the service I was practicing maybe 2hrs before the first race.
Now Im trying f4 and mx5 every week (dont wanna pay for more tracks these few months)

Went back this morning on the cup car and man… i realized I got used to that car SOMEHOW?! It was such a knife edge feel until I stepped away and came  back and now I feel comfortable driving it"
"Interesting.

I'm new to sim racing and definitely find races tiring - but in a good way.

A race requires a lot of focus from me and I need a break after. But that's likely because I'm new so there is so much in trying to put together.

Brake here. Get car rotation, but not to much, don't lose control. Hit the apex there, accelerate now and get ready for the next turn.

It's definitely getting more subconscious.

I actually enjoy how I cannot just run race after race because it prevents me from accidentally blowing 3+ hours on the game in one sitting lol."
"VR isn’t exhausting to race with for most. You only hear about the ones who do find it exhausting, not the ones they don’t."
I’ve sat in VR for endurance races for 8 hours no issue. Everyone is different though. Some people can’t handle it. Some can.
I can do 6hrs in a single stint with my VR and its not my eyes/face that get tired first its my ankle muscles for my brake pedal.
"Thought I was built different but as I keep racing, it gets more and more tiring on the eyes compared to say last month or even last week.

Weekends I'm bing chilling though, road or ovals, just monday-thursdays road is very taxing

 Wish I had the space currently for triples though."
"It’s why I stopped using my headset and switched to triple. Not only is it a lot more comfortable, but you actually have more spatial awareness because triples can give you much wider field of view for peripheral vision. 

Roar was fantastic, my first endurance race. Couldn’t imagine doing it in VR."
"Lmao yepp, zand interlagos - almost instantly on pace. Everything else was hard practice. But yea i made up my mind im going to just stick to ovals and enjoy it while doing tracks i already know + 1-2 new tracks per season max

Seems like less burnout feeling from constant new track learning in my case"
"Exactly the same for me. Started with the idea that I can get 10 laps of practice in 2 minutes on an oval, so I could get more out of my limited time.

Turns out I love racing ovals."
"Shhhh, you'll anger the Americans! (I should know, I am one)"
For sure. I’m 2.3k so it’s not so much about survival anymore for me but you’re definitely right.
"If you stick to the same car for a few seasons and revisit the same tracks, you can drive at 90% pace on auto pilot, really."
[deleted]
"Oval is def nice to mix in with the constant wheel to wheel fighting, have u tried warming up to a road race with an oval race? Ik it sounds odd but I promise u it’ll help get ur braking foot ready for the road race, me n all my friends agree that for some reason it just gets u ready to rock for road, I am also considering switching to Indy car from road this or next season, just bought the Dallara 18 for the C class Indy and man oh man it is a DIFFERENT beast from the F4 car 😂 gonna be lots of practice on the road courses and lots of speed on the ovals"
"haha, in my defence I love oval racing.  The excitement of the racing is unmatched.  Very rarely in road racing do you have side by side battles that go on for any more than a few seconds at a time.  On ovals it can go on for lap after lap after lap."
"Oh for sure. I start to feel it towards the end of the week where running the laps themselves start to get easy and the exhausting part is just navigating traffic and actual racing since experience there is limited.

Just shy of 200 total race laps on the FF1600 so I'm a complete noob lol.

It's always the initial races that are really exhausting, if I run over 3-4 on a track in a week the later ones always feel a lot calmer."
"Except I race regularly with about 30 people that I race with IRL and 90% use VR, with basically no “physically taxing” issues."
I race VR and do not find it physically taxing
I always did 3 hour stints in VR no problem.
"Probably because the most popular and inexpensive headsets also happen to be ergonomic nightmares. 

Most people use Quest 2/3 which has all the weight sitting at the front of their face which sucks.  And the default strap is a bit small for some people, causing a lot of pressure on the head.  And it has a fairly narrow IPD support so people outside of that range will have issues too. 

The discomfort never stopped me from doing 3-4 hour races in it, but it was a noted improvement when I got my Reverb G2 which is far lighter and is basically unnoticeable.  Did a 6h stint in the mooncar 24 and had no issues. "
"Okay, I can be one of those voices from the other side of the camp (we probably just don't have anything to vent about, so don't really post about it): I switched to VR, and race in VR exclusively now, and have zero problems with long stints even on cheap WMR headset. I too did the recent road 2.4h without any problems, and some years ago whole day sessions in LFS cruise servers.

I also just built the triple setup, used it for some time, and decided to dig out the VR headset to compare, since now I have luxury of owning both. And now triples are semi-disassembled :)"
"Add me to the (apparently) very short list of people you've talked to about VR who does not think it's really physically taxing. Running a Rift S.

I feel exactly the same level of tired after X# of races with VR as I did with one monitor. Altho my heart rate is usually a bit higher at the end of a really tight VR race because the stakes feel higher and I actually know that I'm racing wheel to wheel before I'm crashed out by the car next to me that I couldn't see was there on my single monitor.

&#x200B;

(Edit: removed an extra word.)"
"Won by being the only car to stay under 6x, 3rd place was easily the fastest on the track but had 50x and had at least 2-3 penalties to serve."
"Started 28th in GT4, finished 28th. First long run, so I'd say I did well."
"My Roar in meme form.

You know what really grinds my gears. When I’m coming in for a pit stop and the spotter tells me the guy in second just set a 1:53 instead of where my pit stall is. Get your priorities straight.

If you pick a cone as your breaking marker, you’re going to have a bad time."
"I don’t win often at all (11 total in 4 years), but I put it on pole and won the race in the LMP3. SoF was 2.3k in my split. I was shocked I got pole and was really nervous throughout the race. I lead 72 of 83 laps. 

In the final stint I got jumped by the P2 car in the pits. He did a better job fuel saving and didn’t take tires so he jumped me. He pulled about a 7 second gap on me after I had some bad luck behind slower traffic and thought I’d finish P2 or P3 after I was being hunted by the P3 car. 

The car who overtook me in the pits crashed 11 laps into his stint at the bus stop and I managed to barely defend my position from the car behind to win by 3.8 seconds. 

It was amazing and such a good and clean race."
Glad to say I got my first podium in a special event. P3 in GT4 class. It was a tough split I probably was only the 7th/8th fastest in our lobby but managed to survive with no mistakes. Other drivers weren't as clean/lucky.
"Did two GT4 races that were unfortunately single class.

Started 32nd, was sideswiped just before pit lane and ended up with 58 mins of repairs.  Finished 38th.

Started 24th and worked my way to finish 6th.  Only one minor spin, otherwise I was very pleased.

Really wanted some multi class action though."
"I got into lap 1 contact, got spun out, and lost my front on my LMP3. Was then forced to fight my way to the front of bunched up GT4's and had to do half the race missing my front. Then to top things off after my final pit stop I forgot the end of the pit lane isn't the pit exit so I turned off my pit limiter and got a 40 second stop and go penalty.

I finished the entire race and didn't take anyone out so you know what I was just happy to be there"
"Started 14th in TCR, got nailed by a Liger who started in the pits and just flat ran into the back of me in T4. Went in for 10 minutes of repairs. Methodically picked my way through and finished 7th.

First road endurance race, first race at all in about 9 months. So I am happy with the results."
"Not great. Plenty of pace and practice. But lap nine of the final time slot which was the only time slot I could race, I have a car with much lower downforce come by me on the outside of turn one. I gave him too much space, dipped my left tires into the dirt. Car begin to spin and I ended up in the pit exit lane. I had a bunch of damage and an unsafe pit exit penalty. I was done."
"5th in my first try. 

Second race: Pole, led the first 20 laps, then made a stupid mistake lapping the GT4s at the bus stop and spun, luckily not ruining a GT4s race (as it was 100% my mistake), put me back to 8th, then I got punted by a LMP3 in the kink when I lifted for GT4 as I couldn't get passed before the apex, ended up 2 laps down but did get the fastest lap. Really annoying but 100% my fault for making the mistake that put me in the pack."
"Started 7th in GT4, made my way up to 3rd about .3sec behind second with about an hour left then iRacing crashed on me in the middle of the busstop. 

Second year in a row with a win/podium chance taken from me due to circumstances out of my control. Ill channel my inner Ferrari F1...next year is my year lol"
I have to work 6 days a week and iRacing doesn’t provide enough time slots for the working class to participate.
"Time slot 1: P7 

Time slot 4: P7

Time slot 5: P7

Time to buy a lotto ticket :p"
"Gt4 only split, started p40, lap 6 p28.  Get rear ended in the bus stop, 1min 30 repairs, finished p28 a lap down."
"Started p17, worked my way up to p6. was one of the few cars in the lmp3 class that didn’t get lapped. overall it was a ton of fun!"
"Similar, most I got was the bus stop for tires off and one spin. Ran two races and no incident with another driver."
3rd place in GT4. Got the podium on the last lap. LMP3s did their best to try to kill me but I was onto their game!
23rd to 4th in my first and 3rd to 2nd in my second. Drove lmp3 both times.
Started 13th in the 0:00 UTC race last night and finished 10th. Hail Greg!
"Started 7th in a tcr, battled my way up to 4th, and was having a really clean, fun race. Then I lost the rear going into turn 1 about 45 minutes into the race, and I went nose first into the pointy part of the pit wall. I had an hour of repairs and tried coming out without doing the optional repairs but the tire damage was too bad to deal with so I retired.

I don’t know if I was just too hard on the brakes and started turning in, or if I adjusted the brake bias too much that lap. I’ve been really bummed out about it since, though. I’m super glad I didn’t kill anyone else with my stupid mistake, though. If I could have saved it even a bit more in either direction I would have been so much better off."
"I missed the roar sadly. I am looking for a team to join or to partner with for the big race. I have an A license and a lot of experience. So if anyone is looking, please hit me up. Thanks!"
"I came first in LMP3 in two races, finishing 1 minute above 2nd place. 

turns out a lot of people didn't practice."
Finished mid pack with a 0x.
"7th in my first race, and I got a win in my second - driving the Audi TCR."
"P4 in GT4 from qualifying 7th, two class split. Pretty happy with the result since the iR spread in GT4s was around 100, so great result against a very evenly matched field. 

Basically just kept my nose clean and did a good job managing the LMP3s who were spinning out everywhere. Only made one on track pass for position against the pole sitter. They had great single lap pace but ran too much wing so they dropped like a rock when anyone else got in their draft."
"I think I may have been in one of your races. I think I recognise the paint scheme.

I finished P4 in GT4. Started in P5, and was battling for P3 half way through my first stint when two LMP3's made it three wide out of the Bus stop. The outside one hit the middle one, which then sent me into the infield. Luckily no damage, and I only lost 15 seconds. So spent the rest of the race recovering back from P11 to P4.

I did see some very silly moves. Such as the then P4 and P5 GT4 going two wide into the Bus stop. Neither made it out. Had a GT4 back marker ram me off road at Pit Exit as he blindly moved over on me. Same one spun in the bus stop and decided to start moving just as got there (with 4 cars right behind me). Some how we all made it through."
I got taken out by the leader at 2:10/2:20 lapping me after a few half spins/close calls on my own. First time doing a special event too. We were lapping traffic and just plowed into me :/
"Started 15th in a GT4 only split, avoided turn 2/3 carnage and had a clean race for p8."
"First endurance race for me. Qualified on Pole, (GT4 only split,) self spun the first lap and was dead last. Worked my way back up to P12 with 10x total for the race. Could've been a bit better but i screwed up my first pit stop and lost some time since i overshot my pit box. Still had a blast. Probably more fun working through the field than getting p1-p3 being up front the whole time. Still pain. Can't wait for next years."
"Timeslot 1 - 2nd Split LMP3 - P4.

Timeslot 5 - Top Split LMP3 - P1!!!!

Had a belter of a weekend and stoked to grab my first top split special event win, Albeit not the main timeslot. Timeslot 5 still had a 5k SOF for LMP3 so really happy :)"
"22nd and then 5th in gt4. 5th place race was fun. Started 4th spun turn 2, fell to 36th. Slowly got back to 5th over the whole race time."
How do you rack up 50x. Thats absurd.
"50x 💀.

I think I had 5, and they all happened at the damn bus stop."
Standard low split shenanigans.
Should have gone for Plan Q.
You prioritize sleep over racing? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
There were 5 time slots across 3 days. I’m sorry you couldn’t compete but they can’t please everyone. I’m also working class and found the time.
"I mean, I routinely see people DQ’d with 17 in 15-20 minute races, so apply that skill level over a longer race…"
I had 20x from contact in one of my 2 races this weekend. 16 of which were ghost contacts because GTP drivers can't FATHOM not trying to take your mirror while overtaking.
It’s a combination of lack of practice and lack of racecraft.
There's a big difference between being fast and being able to race. There were a few of those people in my race too. They were fast but screwed up every 20 minutes or so.
"I’m getting old, friend."
"If you work 9-5 on the East Coast theres 1 timeslot across 3 days. 

There should be a Sunday morning slot."
"The only one remotely feasible is 0600 Saturday morning but I work 8-6 so it wouldn’t have worked out. Having just one mid day on Sunday would allow a lot of people more opportunity, but the “Sunday” time slot is 18:00 Saturday, which makes no sense."
"I guess, just seems wild to me to rack up that many incidents as a single driver lol"
I work a bit earlier so I guess it suits me better. I work 6-3 M-F so the only slot I normally can’t run is Session 1.
"Those are hotlappers who clearly dont see the other cars on track, because pace wise they just cant keep up. They cant race, they can qualify very fast but cant race"
Kinda easy in what split exactly?
Humblebrag lol
"Your always going to have tracks and cars that click and your naturally fast at. Enjoy the weeks when it feels easy for you. 

For some reason for me it’s Bathurst and Long Beach Island. I’m rapid in anything with downforce and will get a week of feeling like a driving god…..and then the track changes and I remember I’m not a driving god and my skill vanishes. 

Enjoy the good tracks and do your best on the ones that don’t suit your style as much. Everyone’s different and has different tracks they do well and struggle at, even real F1 drivers"
As long as you're having fun and racing clean then you're doing it right.
"The top split in FF is usually with a few 4-8k drivers. Until you're constantly winning those races, I wouldn't worry too much."
"Take advantage of what exactly? Your exclusive Jedi training for lime park?

Anyone can train the same car and track when it’s available. If you are always winning the top split race you are just capitalizing on your skill.

If it were illegal the game would block you from repeating races or something.

Now take some time off the humblebragging and go for the world record fastest lap

Take top #1 in every race

Show them the track is yours as long as you are not sleeping

I look forward to reading the im #1 on Lime Park FF1600 AMA"
"Is it easy or is it boring?

The Ferrari 296 at the Roval is easy for me - in the middle/lower-mid split. Unless you're handily getting podiums in the top split, there's room to improve. And unless the races are unfolding in the exact same way, it's something different each time.

Race the cars/tracks you like. If the track is boring, then don't race it."
"if it’s fun, go for it"
"Yeah, I've seen Alonso there, smooooooth driving"
That makes sense. I just wanted to get your guys take on it since it's a combo that doesn't seem too challenging but is fun. My irating is nowhere close to those numbers so I'll just keep at it when the opportunity arrises
"Hahaha thanks man. I understand, just wanted to get some input"
"Probably more on the boring side. The Ray is fun to race but I feel like I have this track down pretty well with it, so it's a bit boring"
"different time slots, same account, yes

same time slot, same account, no

same time slot, different accounts, yes"
Thank you!!!
"Yep, and yet I can't stay away.."
The series was specifically made to keep the shitty Superspeedway races away from the other series lol
Hug the inside line for dear life lol
There is just no incentive to drive without reckless abandon. Let off and lose the draft and it's game over. The series is designed that way.
"Mann i was about to try it, thanks for letting me know im a perfect fit"
"I love it however I know I'm lacking in skill which is what keeps me away from most oval racing. The superspeedways are fun for a pleab like me and has had my ir up to 2.5 and low as 1.8 recently so I'll call it a win

Singed BooBear"
I just started this series a few days ago and couldn’t agree more.
"If you qualify up front you can generally avoid the madness, but I agree it's pure chaos. Not a place for gaining SR."
Feel you there but I like to join just to make have nice code brown moments that will inevitably shorten my life span
Close. Any race that includes GR86 drivers. Always slower than the MX-5s and fight tooth and nail to assert their 4s lap time slower dominance.
But it’s soooooo much fun.  I love the super speedways
This is Talladega/Daytona in general. It always amazes me that half the people on the bottom lane (including the lead car) can't hold their car right above the line in a smooth fashion.
"100% agree. Played for a weekend and ended up sending in a protest against a guy. He was 1st place being bump drafted by 2nd right on his tail. In an effort to stay consistent, I literally drove the inside line along the entire track anticipating the two of them catching up to me that lap. 

Finally he comes around turn 3 of the oval, and flies all the way down the inside and slams me. And I’m telling you, I watched his cockpit replay, and from the entrance to T2 all the way down that straight, buddy could see exactly where I was the whole time lol.

He proceeds to tear into me with some of the most vulgar shit I’ve ever heard on iRacing lmfao for an easy report. Never went back to the series after that. And this was after always having to toss a coin to see if I’d make it through lap 1 no matter where I was in the pack. Out of 30 drivers, 28th and 29th would almost always scrap like they’re going for the lead and inevitably crash out. Backmarkers and lead lappers had zero respect or understanding for each other. Anytime you lost the lead pack the whole group would just draft around the track like they were king shit of turd island, and anyone they came upon deemed to be “in their way” was a bad driver."
"I’ve only done one draft masters race, but it was 10x cleaner than any of the nascar trucks races I did last season. I’ll never drive that truck again."
The lap cars that wrecked earlier in the race and then run slow in the middle lane and get in the way because they don't care anymore seems to be getting worse lately. And I'm talking top split even so I can only imagine how some of the lower splits are playing out.
"10000% .. just went 5 laps at the start with no wrecks, someone mentions it over the radio and then some genius gets froggy and tries to go 3 wide and ruined a race for a bunch of folks."
You've obviously never raced dirt sprints
"Especially in gen 4 where bumpers don’t line up and fast Af. That and bad drivers is a ticking time bomb 
."
"Lost about 300 oratong due to being in a bad spot at the wrong time, because. It's rough but damn do I enjoy it. I almost won last week until I got aero loose on T4 and spun around on the final lap, finished 9th. Luckily I finally got a win last night in the truck series"
"You just nailed down the Draft Masters experience. I've been run over on the grid several times. Also in the first lap, there are always those sunshine soldiers who think it's a one lap race and plow up the middle 3-4 wide into turn one. I've been in the rare Draft Masters race where there are no wrecks in the first few laps, packs separate a bit and drivers are keeping their line.


I've also qualified near up front and that reduces the carnage, but 7-25 is usually the sweet spot for mayhem. I've actually taken a week off from iRacing. Maybe I'll jump on there tonight. Draft Masters is like digital Cocaine."
You must be a draft master great publicity stunt.
"Ok, go run arca at any of those tracks in mid to bottom splits. #mindchanged"
"Idk the races I’ve been in this week have been fantastic. Albeit that’s upper splits, somewhat surprisingly"
I haven't dared to touch that series. SR/IR killer.
"I won starting from 13th the other night. Had an awesome last 6 lap battle with the guy on the inside in the lead. Was a complete shit show behind us, but damn it was fun"
Me at ARCA Daytona lmao! I have never seen such sloppy lines from some drivers. Not saying Daytona is easy. But cmon figure out how to stay steady. Then I hate to say it but noobs don’t realize they need to lift in the corner or the draft is gonna cause them to slam into the guy in front!!
"I ran one race.  Qualified pole, led 15 if 16 laps....car gets bump draft, drops in front of me...then just parks it.....after 16 laps....then gets mad at me, id never gotten off the bottom other than to pass lappers the entire time.  

Dumb racing."
"Won one race of this in a super clean race by 0.02, then got rammed by the loser after the line and got an 8x as I got pinballed. Second race idiot goes 3 wide and spins me out, I rejoin and as the leaders come round to lap me, one guy rams another who just drives into me…it’s fun but also some folk in this have 0 idea how to race, and yeah agree folk have no idea that you are going to have to lift in the draft, so very good chance of being rear ended…."
"I did my first the other day, finished 2nd with a 0x so I’ve retired 🤣"
Needs a rename to CrashMasters
"I think it is more consistent with bad drawn split and time of day. :D-Like yesterday's F3 Silverstone where after putting a lot of energy to not crash into blocking \*\*\*\*, I finally pull alongside after beckets, get slightly ahead just so the dude straight out decides to bump test me.  (He just ran into me on straight for P3 on lap 4.) In F3 I have had race where dude wanted to crash me, get me upside down on lap 2 and I still ended up 6th, but my god, I have to do - so many reports -.

The same with brake testers (in reality I would immediately remove license from brake testers, these are super dangerous nasty people.)

So like it is everywhere, DraftMasters is just special as it is promoted and you get a lot of ""tourists""."
"I have had fun with the races I have done.  Some horrible driving and some really fun, close races.  I always go into them with the mind set that I will be wrecked and totry and not get to pissy when it happens.  

I had a chance at my first win at a superspeedway last season in the 87 car.  With one lap to go a lapped car couldn't make up it's mind of going high or low and hit the leader.  I tried my best to avoid but there was not much I could do.   Ended up finishing 5th"
"Hey, I don't disagree. Qualied pole and led the race halfway yesterday only to get f-ed by a douche with more testosterone than brains. Last time I'm doing that crap, at least in A class there's a minimum of driving skill and respect (usually)."
For me it’s carb cup. At least in that the stakes are lower tho
I dunno my ratings shot up with the series despite the crazy stuff. Must be the sweet-ass Monte Carlo.
"I agree, but I’ve done a lot of DM and I gained my C license by starting at the back and avoiding the wrecks. Even got a few wins."
"I always seem to have good races once it hits a certain time of night, no matter what series it is. I know the first draft masters I ran was with the gen 4/arca car and we had like 2 cars wreck early and then they all held it together until a lapped car made it complicated on the last lap, leaders were 3 wide to the line, all of them kept it straight"
Why do people make posts that say “change my mind”? It’s so stupid. Why is it our job to do that? We don’t know you or care about who you are.
I feel this way about a lot of DraftMasters races. Then I get in one that goes smooth — and I forget about the 3 where I was just wrecked by a guy 3L back on me.
Tell me about it
They definitely succeeded in their quest lol
"Still doesn't help when officials get there. Those are still shit, sadly"
Was that not the point of Carb Cup / PickUp Cup?
Yes designed to keep all the people using controllers in one place haha.
Super short races with no cautions. Might as well have called the series Arca brakes.
It's pretty easy to fall back and still get SR and IR. Half the field crashes anyways.
"Definitely not going for SR, just trying to have fun lol"
"That's wild man, 9 put 10 races I do in truck series have maybe 2 cautions in the back of the field and stay green for the rest, last week I think I ran my first 40 lap caution free race, which sucks because I went in for tires and banked on a potential caution lmao"
Yea I’ve gained 1000IR since this series started. I start from the back and just drive 20 laps like ms daisy. Have yet to lose iR in any of these races
"Crazy cuz I’ve while I’ve had the usual shenanigans, it usually isn’t that bad in the trucks for me"
"Difference IMO is sprints require skill to race competently. Racing at Talladega and Daytona only requires holding a line and having a pair of eyes that don't have input lag, but people still struggle lol"
I want to be good at dirt so bad.
I think Steven Crowder is to blame for that.
Lost my 7k because I ran a few DraftMasters races as the 1 car.
At least with officials there are yellows
"My theory: since it’s official and counts for iRating, it draws in the “wreckers or checkers” reckless drivers even more than unofficial Carb/PickUp which counts for nothing."
Then why even drive in the series? Or drive at all? There are way better tracks you can do this on seeing as iRacing uses the amount of turns to calculate SR. A short track hanging back with a few instances will be better for SR than a clean superspeedway.
Damn 7k! Nothing to gain if you’re that high. Usually filled with farmers trying to inflate their irating. Could be fun if they were actually good drivers filling the fields.
"Submit this to iRacing, I bet they'll use it. Great racing!"
Love seeing these vids! Great racing from both!
Dude started “blinking” after that block. Good racing on a great track.
hell ya
Door to door awesomeness
Just some good old racin
Still there guy having to work for his paycheck
"That BMW asked for a report.Blocking the Porsche on the straight and then flashing you for no reason or maybe for himself not giving you enough space in the chicane.  


But this 2 Minute side by side is gorgeous!"
I had one similar at LeMans in the GTP in a fight for second. Almost the whole last lap we swapped positions. Wasn't even mad he beat me I had an absolute blast doing it.
Gaht damn that made me COOM
Even though for every one of a situation like this compared to the hundred times I'd get punted is the reason I do iRacing over every other sim.
"Already done, weeks ago. No answer so far :("

I’m using simhub with this 5” monitor as an extended display

"Ah this is good news then, I’ll look into that for sure! Thank you so so much"
"Because Americans count turns weirdly, look at the mess Sonoma is"
"I honestly had no idea that the number of turns on a track affects your SR. It makes sense, just never thought of it"
"Are you sure that the Track Info numbering matches what iRacing uses for SR through? Cause I figured they're just using the real-life tracks' corner numbering for those maps.

I definitely wouldn't expect Road America to count as exactly 14 corners for the sake of SR, given that turns 2 and 4 aren't really corners, but 13a is one that you have to lift for in many cars."
"I think it does get counted. While the track map doesn't show a corner number it shows the last corner as 11 on the boot layout and 7 on the cup layout. But while inside the sim at the top it says turns 12 for boot and 8 for cup. Which is 1 more than the track map shows,.


Also classic shows 7 which lines up with the track map and the only difference between classic and cup is the busstop"
"It is (or used to be?) that a single track had a single 'data description' with it that stayed the same even if the layouts changed. For example, if you spin (spun?) into the infield at Daytona oval and stop there, the yellow won't come out, but if you stop on the busstop chicane on the back stretch the yellow comes out because its a 'racing surface' for at least one of the configs. Since watkins often uses no chicane maybe they don't want to give out SR points for going straight in that situation?"
"Some tracks are numbered by corner stations, not the actual number of bends on the track.

In the case of Watkins, the chicane was added a couple decades after the track was (re)designed, so that's likely why they aren't individually numbered.

Wherher this dictates iRacing's count for SR I can't say, but this is why the numbering seems odd."
"![gif](giphy|bEil3AmI6N6w9rxCbP|downsized)

Real tracks are just one big never-ending corner /Freedom"
And Martinsville has 4 turns. ‘Merica
"That’s not even the worst, apparently the straight at Road America after T2 is turn 3 😵‍💫🤣"
Incidents per turn is the metric
It's not the directly determined by the number of corners but since you gain points for each clean turn by default the lower number of corners the worse bang for your buck you get.
"All corners, all the time. Boogity boogity boogity."
"Bro that’s just standard oval. Doesn’t matter what size it is, they count it as having 4 turns.

I wouldn’t try tell an American ovals are only 2 turns because ya gona be there a while arguing 😂😂"
That too
And then you have 11 as the kink and then 11a and 11b leading up to canada corner
"The slight bend after Turn 1 is Turn 2, the second *real* corner is Turn 3. The next corner with a braking point is Turn 5, on that long straight you have Turns 3a and 4.

Then after Canada Corner (Turn 12), there's a slight bend that's Turn 13, and an actually significant corner that's Turn 13a."
"Very good to know, thank you"
"As an American oval racer, I can kind of justify the reason for it in my head, but it sounds dumb out loud. It just is how it is lol"
Poor little Pocano getting left out.
"You can farm SR in quali / after the race by driving for the entire clock on quali and for the 2 minute cooldown timer after the race, if you didn’t know. I’ve gotten up to +0.75 for a single race. Just don’t hit the parked cars after the race or have any incidents."
"Wow, that's huge. I had no idea, thank you!"
"Also if you really want to farm sr just do a vrs gt endurance race if you get 0x you will gain massive amounts of sr, and probably depending on split still gain IR"
Checked packet loss?
Wifi or hardwired?
Reboot your router and switches.
What are your speeds?
Ive recently had similar issue and have seen and talked to a few others experiencing the same. It could be iracing side or the bad weather the US is experiencing at the moment. Not sure.
Hardwired
500 d/100 u
"Check for packet loss. Possibly call your ISP and have them run diag or send out a tech. I had a similar issue in a house i lived in previously. The source cable had been knicked and reburied, im assuming by someone doing landscape work, and was causing all sorts of weird, intermittent issues, but my speed would always test fine."
"Has to be packet loss of sorts, you should be fine with those speeds"
"I mean, in a 24hr race the track will change a lot. After a couple hours it'll be 100% usage and stay that way until the end, other than that humidity and temperature will change greatly during the day/night cycle."
"One thing to keep in mind is that no matter the track state, it will feel different with just you turning laps vs a full field turning laps because more heat will be generated and soaked into the track. The rubber on the surface will feel different."
"GT4 is like a nice wine, GT3 is like liquor. Sometimes you wanna go fast, sometimes you wanna enjoy the race."
"I came to iRacing after being an ACC guy and had planned on racing GT3s here. Once I started racing GT4s I just never stopped racing them, I love the racing in that class so much. I still race GT3s every once in a while just not near as much as I expected, but you can find me in GT4 lobbies damn near every day lol"
"I race both, along with many others. Do as much as I can/can be bothered"
"I race multiple classes for fun. My preferred class overall is GTP, but I do a fair amount of GT3/GT4 throughout the season as well. I usually pick what I want to drive based on the track for that week. I don’t get wrapped up in feeling like I need to stick to one car or one discipline. I’m here for fun just as much as I’m here for the stiff competition, so I don’t like to limit myself to 1 thing."
"Lol, this is perfect."
"It doesn't look like you were anywhere near him, maybe the spotter calls made him nervous but you did nothing wrong.

For future reference though, TV cameras are really difficult to judge anything from, chase cameras are clearer."
"You did absolutely nothing wrong. You caught him and passed him cleanly leaving him tons of space. He just lost it.

Also, for future reference, if you post a clip looking for feedback, it’s best to use one of the chase cameras so we can see the car positions clearly."
You made him stress out cuz he was getting passed and made a mistake. That was clean
"Just trying to learn, as I'm a new rookie.

After following the driver ahead and closing the gap , I thought I'd look for an opportunity to pass.

Was my pass OK, or did I cause the other driver to spin?

Just trying to learn.  Thanks."

Does anyone need a team for Daytona? Friend and I are looking for a third for BMW GTP
"if your still looking for another teammate id be open to running with you guys, and what car are you running?"
"if your still looking for another teammate id be open to running with you guys, and what car are you running?"
Looks like you got a team! Good luck!

"Have had a play around, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Cheers though!"
Just be faster than everyone and you'll be fine
"It's one of my $10 participation series, so I have to do at least one race.  I am worried."
The blind hill was bad enough in F4 lol
"I qualified 3rd in my split and got punted from behind going into 1. So that was cool.

Might give it another go because it's an insanely fun combo."
"Good combo, it just does not encourage passing with high downforce cars through most of the corners on this track. 

And people don’t get that."
Racing drivers hate this one simple trick....
That's really awesome. But don't forget that your Irating increases so you race with people having more or less the same skill. It's going to be harder and harder to keep winning :)
"I did some ""test"" driving on the ARCA car on next week's track.  I put test in """" because I struggled to complete a lap.  FML it is difficult. Fixed setup so you can't make it any better.  I have no idea how people manage to race these on a road course."
I know! :) I definitely see the challenge increasing. The hardest for me right now is making passes in Ferrari. The car is wide and the track isn’t and it’s hard to get runs off the racing line. Oval racing it’s a bit easier for me but I tend to save my tire early and push later.
Nashville is an awesome track to really get your skill set right. It’s slick and hot and requires learning those small inputs to be consistent. I definitely recommend running it. My advice for qualifying keep it tight just below that bottom seem. Ease into the gas not going full throttle till the track is flat. Then for your long run practice sure the first couple laps you can push the bottom but run just above that bottom seem almost middle it’ll save your tire and you’ll stay consistent in the 19 flats to 19.5 till you catch traffic
"When I started with Iracing some years ago I got pole on my first quali, won races with a big margin and thought I was the next Senna. 
Until I promoted and faced the hard reality that I sucked :D 
But racing with people who are faster is actually much more fun. Sometimes I'm happier getting in the top10 now than I was with winning races in the beginning."
Get the Lotus 79 so I'll have someone else in the Classic series.  We'll just have to talk 2 more people into racing it for official scoring :p.

"Why does the money in your account expire? What a joke. Seriously, that ought to be illegal."
What do you have?
Renault Clio all the way ;)
Check out the Lotus 49 and 79 discords. They have scheduled community races weekly that are broadcasted by the GSRC. Simply need a good enough SR/IR to get into the top split.
"Lol, are you a UK time racer?  It's in my basket."
Also...worth mentioning the 79 F'n SLAPS with an H-pattern shifter.
Plenty of legacy tracks for $5 or so
"Second that, I just bought it since indycar is back and wow is it fun and not as tough as I thought.

Still tough though"
"Always wanted to do the IR18, but it seems dead when I would normally race"
"I second this, great car to get into GT3"
It's probably promotional credit and not cash purchase.
"iRacing Credits are not money.  

 iRacing Dollars (what you reload your account with) is money and doesn't expire. "
Credits now expire after 2 years. People were hoarding them before probably.
Idk some legacy stuff like mercedes gt3 and nurburgring i think is the only stuff i bought
"US (midwest) region, unfortunately.  But I'm racing almost every weekend and most evenings I'll get one in."
"true but, if OP doesnt have the indycar its gonna be used for a lot more things now than once a season legacy track"
I am guessing from the phrasing that OP wouldn't mind covering the $2 difference
"theyre at nurb this week and every time i would check the entries it would be like 20. last week at pheonix the participation wasnt really there but when they were at dega it would split. Its just a hit or miss depending on the track, but next season we should see some official indycar tracks and im sure participation will skyrocket after indy 500"
"Oh really? I've had $5 credit for as long as I can remember. I'll have to check its still there. But knowing my luck, it will have expired yesterday."
"Agreed lol, was just saying"
"Protests don't get you SR back, even when you win."
"No, there’s nothing to protest there. Netcode happens."

Alternatively, don't hit stuff you can see."
Read the sporting code 
My favorite is getting a 4x for being rear ended.
"I mean, you would still get the 4x show up even if you think there was no contact.  It doesn't get added later. So surely you would have seen this, no?  And yet you kept doing it.  Over and over and over and over."
My wife complains about getting 4x from me while getting rear ended all the time.
Giggity
Thank you Glen
Dang! This is such a fun series. Sometimes it has me punching the air after some rookie takes me out but other times I’m smiling from ear to ear from all the close racing!
"Same! Thankfully, the last few races, the idiot taking me out has been me... 

I'm definitely glad I decided to stick with the vee for a season after getting out of rookies. It's had some of the best racing I've experienced so far."
"I don't need a button to type/say to the chat nice driving to the person :p

Don't be embarrased to give praise. If others hear someone did nicely , it's much more valuable than digital +1 on a stat page"
"what would be ideal is a simple like button next to their name, and it is persistant on the servers so if you race with them again you already know them to be good without remembering a million names"
"I was just thinking this yesterday. In the MX-5 advanced and this dude and I were just about perfectly matched for pace. Qualified within a couple tenths of each other. For 30 minutes we leap frogged each other. Every pass was clean, aggressive, and cautious. It was a masterclass in how to be respectful but not give an inch. I really wish I could’ve like given the guy a commendation that would boost his SR or something. Though I’m sure such a system would be rife with abuse."
This is the type of racing that I yearn for 🙌🏻
"I’m okay with this if it’s a private stat that doesn’t accumulate as a means to encourage people to communicate and meet people they may want to be friends with and race with consistently.

Publicly I think this sort of system would be easily abused and turn into more of a popularity contest. If I was able to see how much praise someone had received from other drivers I’m not sure what kind of expectation that would create and it would be easily shattered the moment you came across someone who didn’t live up to that expectation during a race."
"It seems on topic for me to give a shout out to **Wesley Cadwallader**, I had 2 very fun races at Daytona during VRS series, week 4. We pretty much had the same pace and we met in 2 consecutive races. In the first race I tried my best to overtake but he put up a great defence. He must have noticed that we were able to race fast and clean, because during the second race we both realised we could work together to get through the field and so we did, helping each other (well mostly he bump drafted me which got us through a couple of other drivers). Clean, fun racing with a fellow sim racer."
I always type some good words on chat after clean racing but huge +1 for create special button for this.
"Yep, Final Fantasy 14 (and a bunch of other games) has this. At the end of a dungeon you can give a commendation to one person out of the group.

Would be cool to have this in iRacing. Just a small „I enjoyed racing with this person“ button. It doesn’t need to do anything beyond letting the other person know they‘re appreciated. This and a lot of other small things in FF14 make it a lot less toxic than other games."
Happens in A rated oval asphalt all the time. And it is nice (and usually not toxic). B to pretty often.
"I'm really surprised this isn't a thing already. Seems to be implemented in just about every competitive game out there.

Definitely should be a way to commend other drivers."
"Agreed! I also had a great battle at Lime Rock in the Vee today. Forget the placing, 3rd or 4th maybe. Driver behind would get in front down main straight each lap, I’d take the defensive inside the whole way down and brake to block his line. He tried a few switchbacks but couldn’t get it done. Reckon this went on for 7 laps until I hit the bloody red kerb at the chicane! 


Tried to send a DM to him after the race but didn’t go through or something. Maybe he’d left the server? 


As a newbie, is there a right way to reach out to someone after a race? Or only when in the server?"
I usually give em a 4x after the race to let them know I appreciate not wrecking us lol
Write to support and suggest it. I agree with you and think this would be a good addition.
"I use the driver tags in race labs. Have probably twice the amount of good, clean drivers than I do dirty ones."
"How would it be ""in the same way""? We would just be telling iRacing and it wouldn't be public?"
I forget which one but one of the overlay programs has a system like this.
I also had a great battle in the vee. Guy messaged me after but I can't figure out how to see it and respond. Wish the messaging worked better lol
I had an incredible battle in the ROAR this weekend. Had to defend for my life for the last probably 10 laps only to win by 3.8 seconds. The P2 driver was clean and fair and made me work for that win.
"Send them a forum message. I always apologize this way and thank them, too, for a great race."
Love this
"I keep saying. At least a bonus for going 0.2s lap after lap in licence. But no. 1000 clean laps equals to 0.0002 points. Bit you look at the freaking white line and get a 1x and -0.1 licence. One netcode 4x and bum! You are B again. 


Fanboys. Please. Abstain. Not gonna read it."
"it's a good idea that should already be a thing. I can understand why it isn't, though; I can imagine seeing this as another metric to farm for, like SR, especially if it's tied to some tangible reward. with so much bullshit we put in the way of just having a good race, it's refreshing enough when you have one to simply thank the folks you've just raced with. if nothing else, just drop a ""good drive,"" and a ""thank you"" on your way back to your pitbox. 

doesn't need a button, but there definitely be a button. I'd love to see Kudos right next to the Protest button, to at least even it out. even without a button, we all need to be the racer that we all wanna race with. positive reinforcement goes a very long way."
"Maybe increase SR if you are X amount of time under 0.5 from a car with 0x incidents would be better

Praise button would just transform into “please give me a upvote”"
I had a similar run for p1 with a guy. First half of the rave i hung back about 1 sec just to barely be in the draft and stay with him but without making him run defensive. Once we had about 10 seconds gap from p2 to p3 i pushed and We pretty much swapped for p1 every lap on the straight or during/exit on t1. I was faster on the sweeping turns but he was faster on the chicane. So I would time my run in t1 to have a passing run on him into t2. I would hold the lead and gain up to the chicane which he would gain enough back to draft into the lead on the straight and then be able to defend the turn. But on the next lap it would repeat and I would go back to p1. We swapped until white flag I got a better run on the chicane and held just long enough to be able to defend on t1 in which he mis judged his speed on the outside and over ran into the dirt....I was a big sad even though I won because we didn't get to have the final fight with the draft on the straight for the finish.
"Had a race long nose to tail battle with a S. McDonald in ARCA Montreal a couple days ago. We were never past a second and usually under a half from each other. No contact, no drama. He was quicker in the first half, I was quicker in the second and anytime I got a piece of advantage I got wheelspin and couldn't exploit it. 

Super close, and very enjoyable."
"while i see your point and agree that giving props where props is due is important, having a tangible ""kudos badge of honor"" that represents a visual metric of how enjoyable you are to race with would only add incentive for racers to participate respectfully."
Racelab already has this I believe
"It's something they do in league too, honour one person at the end of the game, you get fuck all from it besides the feelgoods but it's still nice."
"Dota2 has commend and dislike button, commends are displayable and given to any of the 9 other players."
Don't know what is going on at LimeRock this week but the FF1600 has been consistently some of the most respectful racing I have on the service in a year.! It's been great fun.Long may it continue It's also been a chance to up SR before I try F4 at Spa this week 😂
"Through the forums, they will get an email by default if I remember correctly"
"I think you're joking but on the tiny chance you're not aware - incidents after the race still counts against your SR until the ""final"" server countdown timer kicks in after a few minutes."
"Visual metrics just lead to exploiting and farming. Remembering that Jonathan Sexstonson got praise from random guy in a race is much more meaningfull than seeing him and 20 others with a badge they asked their friends to upvote for. 

Having that system doesn't remove the ability to give praise but i'd much rather give and take it more personally; maybe i'm just old :p"
Yes but would be nice for iRacing to implement since I don't want to pay more subscriptions for the one game
Yep driver tags. You get 4 or 5 with the free sub and unlimited with the paid sub
They give you loot capsules periodically.
Oh I know. Lol. Most top split oval guys don’t care about SR. If I beat you you can put me in the wall on the cooldown. I’m cool with it
"That’s the old, “we tried nothing and it didn’t work,” argument. Every system can be exploited, and will be by a small fraction of the userbase. That doesn’t mean you don’t try. There are also controls that can be implemented to catch or counteract exploits. 

I think such a system would add a little depth and color to the iR/SR systems we currently have (which, btw, can be and are actively exploited by a small subset of users), and yes, provide some positive reinforcement and motivation for good, clean driving.  Not that I think iRacing will implement such a system, but there’s no reason to dismiss the idea outright. "
I fully agree. I don’t see why I need to spend extra for a track map & driver tags. These features should be included in the base game
You get a certain number with their free service. Unlimited with the $5 a month subscription
"Okay that's true, very occasionally when you're honour level ranks you will gain a loot orb of some kind that 9 times out of 10 will be some shitty emote."
"Huh, interesting. I'm only on road, I had no idea."
"It's not just that; we're kind of past that phase with these systems. They have been tried alot. From upvotes and likes to similar system in games. It's not that they don't work but more that they swift the culture within the game. Instead of saying ""thank you for a nice race"" you coldly press a button with loaded feelings in it. On one occasion(ns2) the praise button was used as a negative signal and players with high positive ""karma"" were just bullied out of the servers.

That's why I just find that giving feedback straight from person to person is a better system that should be encouraged instead of a measure metric button."
"Top split ovals is basically a league. You run with pretty
Much the same guys over n over so you know who cares n who does."
I mean. Isn’t this dudes recommendation essentially just Reddit……upvotes and downvotes. It’s as simple as that. Overwatch 1 had a decent system for that tbh.
"yep, exactly"
yes and I still dislike it  due to reasons above. It's not universally bad.
"If you can get a cheap Reverb G2 to try, go for it. It's a huge step up from a Q2.

That said, as someone with the same PC hardware, a Q2, a Reverb G2, and a Vive Pro 2, I don't race in VR anymore. I switched to a 34"" UWQHD, and every time I've tried racing in VR since, I've remembered exactly why I did it.

This is all completely subjective, and plenty of people swear by VR, but I personally found that the immersion was short-lived, and the inconvenience of wearing a headset for 30-45+ minutes ruined the potential benefits. It's cool at first, but it gets old fast after a few spilled drinks and long races leaving your face feeling like grilled cheese. Just my personal take."
The good news is the FOV police have no jurisdiction in VR land :)
"I have a  34"" UWQHD and Q2 on a 3070/12700k machine, I do not use the 34 for iRacing, the immersion the ability to drive side by side is unbeatable when using VR. I have participated in the last ROAR longest race I have done I had no problem with the VR. With VR you need to memorize the button layout and have every item like a bottle located in the same place, but once accustomed there is no way back to single screen."
"Grab a cheap used Oculus Go, and try it out with virtual desktop. 

40-50 bucks. See if vr is for you.

It has high enough fidelity to be an indicator of whether you want better, or just to go back to monitors."
"I just got triples after racing for exclusively with a Rift S for the past few years. VR is incredible for immersion and I will always go back and race it every once in a while. Triples are so much more convenient, being able to see what button I’m pressing, being able to just glance over at the baby monitor to make sure the baby is still sleeping, being able to use overlays like Kapps and Racelabs, not overheating and getting really sweaty and the biggest one for me in longer sessions was there was a very specific angle the headset had to sit on my head to be clear and I had to tighten the headstrap a ton to keep it there which lead to frequent headaches after an hour or 2. VR is amazing and I love it but after getting and experiencing triples I wouldn’t want it to be my only way to race."
"I also just made the swap from VR to a 45” DQHD. Very similar reasons. It does get a bit uncomfortable. If you are a contact wearer, your contacts will dry out in longer races as well and that discomfort really can affect your performance. The inability to get a drink or use the mouse or keyboard also sucks. You’re going to be locked to just racing and nothing else without it being a major hassle. If you have a nice wheel you better be prepared to memorize all the button locations by heart. And then just as the above user said the immersion kind of wears off. It’s also going to sound a bit odd and idk if anyone else has this sensation but at times you can tell you are in VR and also looking at small screens. It’s a bit odd and it isn’t a deal breaker but there’s times where I can become aware of this and it at times breaks my concentration. VR is awesome and I think it becomes personal preference at this time. I think it’s right on the edge of being the best possible setup for sim racing but we are still a few years out imo."
I just raced a 2 hour race with the Quest3  yesterday and it was fine. When it get hotter I’ve got a windsim for a breeze of air. That’s what I’d suggest. A fan or something like that for some coolage.
"Some good points thanks for that, was the FOV gain over a single 34"" not really worth it?"
Using a halo head strap means no more grilled cheese. I use the Bobo m3.
"I race mostly GT/LMPs, so most of the extra visibility gets blocked by the car interior anyway. It's pretty nice in formula cars, though."
"SF starts have been a wreck fest. I swear every race has some guy doing a standing start for the first time, trying to dump the clutch at full throttle."
The frame rate is incredible
Yeah Reddit fucked up the processing
"We did extensive amounts of testing and the caddy was losing rear grip at a much faster rate than the others. The Acura was nerfed, the Beamer is overly fragile and drives way different than the other 3. The Porsche is the best overall and seems to be the most comfortable over a 24h span."
"I have far and away the most experience in the caddy but how loose it got as the fuel run progressed, let alone a hot track… it was borderline unsafe I felt to try 24 hours in her."
Yeah the Porsche is by far the most comfortable to me as well. Over the course of a race I find myself fucking up less in it versus the caddy and Acura.
"Adjust the ARB's over the course of the stint. Softer in the rear, harder in the front. You can do that via the in car adujstments black box or bind buttons for it"
"Yeah, I was doing that and it was helping but the overall comfort was still more with the Porsche. I’m heartbroken because I love the caddy haha"
"Why do you want to get to 165fps? This isn't a first person shooter. 100fps is plenty. If you want more turn down your graphics some. I had a 1080ti and an i7 9700k and was getting 90fps on ultrawide TRIPLES at 1440p with mid settings. 

First thing you should turn off is object self shadowing. That will get you 20 fps. 

To answer your question, CPU and GPU. 5800x3d and maybe a 4070. I can think of plenty of other things to spend $800 on though."
 You need to include your monitor specs to receive any meaningful feedback
"We need number of monitors and budget

I would stick with the AM4 family and do minor upgrade to each component 

16gb DDR4 can be had for <$60

5600-5800 cpu can be 150-300$ 

And then rest on whatever gpu and your budget 

in my opinion"
"You want 165fps at what quality? From what I can tell from this [fps calc](https://pc-builds.com/fps-calculator) you should be getting what you want right now if you just set things to med-high. Ultra you should be seeing a hit.

If you really want ultra for some reason then figure out what GPU you are willing to pay for and is still available, then plug it into the bottleneck calculator on that same site to figure out what's the minimum CPU you'll require to match it with.

TBH iRacing isn't overly greedy when it comes to graphics so you should be able to find something that will give you the level you want so probably better to be looking at what is the most graphic hungry game you have and aim for that one instead."
"The one most meaningful upgrade you could do, the GPU. Find either a 3080 used or a new 4070. On the 4070, the Super series is about to be released so may want to wait for that to get released. 
You won’t be disappointed. The next thing to look at RAM up to two 16GB sticks of DDR4 3600, your Ryzen will thank you for it. 
I wouldn’t upgrade the CPU unless you’re going to update it to the current gen. 

I will add it’s helpful to know your power supply in requests like this because if you’re upgrading your GPU you might have to upgrade your power supply. Additionally do not, I repeat, do not cheap out on your power supply. Get a well known brand w/ at least 850 to give yourself a proper upgrade path in the future. I can’t recommend SeaSonic enough. They are usually higher price wise but well worth it."
"please ignore everyone else, the most cost effective upgrade for your pc is to slot in a 5800x3d cpu."
My brother in christ your PC is far better of a build than mine
"i appreciate the advice, thank you! 

to answer your question, i'm okay with 100fps. i was just curious what i'd need to do to get more. the difference between 165fps and 100fps is pretty noticeable to me personally, and if its realistic and within my budget to give myself that smoother experience i'd definitely go for it."
"What this guy said. what you’re looking for is consistent FPS, not really high FPS.   If you’re getting consistent 100FPS you’re good to go."
edited the post with monitor information. apologies for not having that originally!
"edited the post with monitor information. apologies for not having that originally!

thank you for the reply!"
There's no reason you shouldn't be able to get 165fps on your current setup. Run graphics auto config and turn down some of the less noticable settings like self shadowing. If you have Reflex enabled that will cost you about 15-20fps.
Sick. Whats your power split ratio?
Most underrated car in the game
Skills
Man how far we come. I remember when drifts were basically impossible on the service because of the tire model.
Noice
_I wonder If u kno_
Being AWD this is a powerslide not a drift but nice car control
Absolutely sick drift
That is not easy to do ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
think it was 0.65. didnt test alot of diffrent settings. but i imagene that if you have to much rear drive. then the car becomes uncontrollable. and with more forward bias you can controll the car better. aslong as you have a little bit of throttle. (basiclly drive as if it's a fwd)
I do hotlaps with it just to hear that 5 cylinder symphony.
Just luck.
"I mean most cars are on slicks, real drift tires are hard as fuck and are a different compound."
They still are. But a handfull of cars make it work anyways
I guess that means the tire model is completely inaccurate? would you mind explaining a little more detail what you mean?
the google machine tells me that a powerslide happens after turn in. where as a drift starts before turn in. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)
Practice on assetto corsa helps alot
Luck doesn't go sideways through multiple corners!
"The tire model is a LOT better than it was.

Tire grip works like a bell curve more or less, meaning that you still produce grip past the limit, but less, making a car saveable.

The old tire models v6 and back that is, gave grip up until it fell off a cliff, and there was no regaining it through adjustment. 

Old iracing was a game of being just under the limit. We are not there anymore."
Definatly used up all my luck for next week
"Interesting, thanks!"
Good luck
"You might be able to get away with running the PC in that configuration, but it wont be a great experience. Youre going to be pushing, at least, double the pixels and while the 2nd monitor won't cause much of a performance hit if you're only running telemetry or a dash or whatever, the increased pixel count of the larger monitor will. I would update your GPU prior to adding more screen real estate to improve the overall experience."
"Awesome, thanks for the info!"
"I haven’t done it, but I heard you might be able to join the grid, and then hold ESC or whatever button to pit. That way the rest of the grid doesn’t have to wait the full 2mins."
"If you grid then tow, you'll count as being ready but will start from pits. Without unduly delaying the start."
"I would strongly recommend not starting from the pits, qualify and for the first few laps be passive and wait for a bit of field spread, you will likely finish in a good position and be racing with people your pace. Starting from the pits you will have to make your way through the carnage of crashed cars on lap 1 and 2 then you will have to overtake the cars you are quicker than, this is more of a risk tham just being passive as the people at the back of the grid usually arent the best at race craft as they are trying to grind sr"
You just don't grid. Once the countdown is up it will say missed start and just click that
ok thanks
"Ideally you still want to grid, and then leave the grid when the lights come on. This prevents delaying the start for everyone else as the countdown will stop once everyone is on the grid."
"Dick move to let the counter run out just because you want to start from pits, grid right away once the grid timer starts and get a tow, once it says missed start you can join from pits."
Exactly and then you’ll just have to make your way through the Mad Max action scene in turns 2 & 3. After that it mellows out — more like Road Rash with chains and maces as you pass cars.
"Man I loved that game, I wish there was a modern equivalent."
