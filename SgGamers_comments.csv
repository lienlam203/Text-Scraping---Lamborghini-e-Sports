Used to have one website which posted small version of the event photos but no longer around. Should have saved those images for posterity! Believe most of the photos back then were digitally scanned from prints.

"time to inject some life into this sub <3

**Grew up with Nintendo**
We had a Nintendo 64. I remember how my family would sit around the TV and just watch my mom play Super Mario 64. Then came Ocarina of Time, along with so many awesome memories. I would be the one playing, my sisters would watch and read the walkthrough to guide me along(curse you water temple). It was a bonding thing, where watching people play was just as immersive as playing the game. 

And here I am now, with a Switch and Breath of the Wild :'D

**Console? Computer?**
I'd say its a mish mash. In the end, it all depends on money. Some of us aren't able to get all the consoles in existence, so pc is generally the main platform of choice since it's generally used for more than just games. Besides, in this day and age, a computer is pretty much almost necessary. Consoles however, are not.

**North, South, East, West**
I would say all of the above. If it's a good game, I'll take it. As with all my buds as well. We all appreciate great games, be it Monster Hunter coming from Japan or the GTA series coming from the states, if it's awesome, we're happy.

**Arcades, rental, non-at-home-gaming**
Arcades are still around, I don't frequent them. Never have since young, so once again, it's a preference thing. But the fact that they're still around shows that they're doing alright.

As for rentals, to the extent that I'm aware of, I don't think there are game rentals? I may be wrong tho.. I think the only type of rentals we do are when we borrow games from friends :/

**Censorship and ratings**
Censorship here is pretty much standard stuff I guess. The Media Development Authority handles it, I haven't really been bothered by the censorship so far so... Can't really comment on it. 

As for my own ratings, come to think of it, I don't have any rating system :x It's pretty much just ""wow, nice game, fun game, will play"", and then I just play and enjoy it. If it doesn't get on my radar or just doesn't really interest me, I'd just ignore it. Sure, I'll know that it exists, but I won't go out of my way to find out more.


**tl;dr**
grew up with a nintendo 64.
I think SG's main platform is PC.
If game good, regardless of north south east west, will play.
Arcades still alive. Rentals? No idea.
MDA does censors, meh.
